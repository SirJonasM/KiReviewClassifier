'I spent eight years running movie theatres in the 80s and 90s. This was by far the worst film I ever showed to the public. One thing that made it so bad was that it put on airs of trying to be a great inspiring film. Even the great Gregory Peck could not save this horrid piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis in an early non-horror film role demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act (shes still trying but it isnt getting much better).<br /><br />Im sorry and heres the spoiler international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball! Even the shows on Nick and The Disney Channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that dreck.<br /><br />This is not worth the time you would waste watching it on cable TV. It is not worth the price of a movie rental; your dollar would be better spent on an extra package of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you picked (because it can only be better than this).',neg
'Che: Part One was a fascinating experiment which did not only tell a very interesting story but it also tried to do something different with the biopic genre.Che: Part Two is the excellent culmination of this experiment.<br /><br />This movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one from the extraordinary performances (specially from Benicio del Toro) to Steven Soderberghs brilliant direction without forgetting its intention of breaking with the conventional rules from the biopics.That is what I admire from Soderberghs experiments...they always try to do something different and unusual and they succeed most of the times.<br /><br />The final message from this film is perfect and it includes everything we have been told about Che Guervaras life.The only fail I found on Che: Part Two is that a few parts felt a bit irrelevant.<br /><br />In summary I give Che: Part Two a very enthusiastic recommendation because as the first one it is a brave and fascinating experiment which challenges the spectator and leaves us thinking.',pos
'This is one of the worst pieces of cinema I have seen in some time. This is also my first review so you can tell I must hate this film at lot.<br /><br />Dont get me wrong I like my serious films. I dont like Hollywood too much I tend to like French Italian offbeat US or anything that tries to communicate something sensible.<br /><br />But this was awful. Why? 1. The plot (such as it was) was entirely unbelievable even though the director seems to be hinging everything on a feeling of realism.<br /><br />2. The main character has nothing to recommend him. Does he smoke for coolness or to show us his angst? For goodness sake this guy is meant to be an ex-dodgy mafia lawyer. Are we meant to care more because that he is also one of the meanest unfriendly people you could ever meet? And he smokes...so he must have deep personal issues. Pop psychology at its best. In the final moments I almost cheered as he gets buried in the cement. Best place for him. And I thought that was about the only good scene. Or maybe that was because it was so close the final credits.<br /><br />3. The entirely tired and unbelievable interest in the main character from the beautiful girl. She was there simply because beautiful girls always have odd sexual relationships with old old men with a deep and meaningful personality (as demonstrated by smoking). Happens all the time. In really bad films that is.<br /><br />4. The pace was so leaden. I like slow I like careful. But this was just deathly.<br /><br />5-50 a bunch of other stuff that I really cant be bothered to write.<br /><br />Awful.',neg
'This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. From the very first scene i knew it would be a smash crash. It starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission. As it turns out the people in it were possessed by some random zombies. Well some years later some college kids are pulling some pledge prank. Horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock. Things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non-chalonte manner with pledge over reacting and over-doing the whole eager to be popular role What really took the cake with this one is the final battle. Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with the guns. For example guns making a noise with no muzzle flash and vice-versa. this is accompanied by stop-animation zombies (why they move in stop motion is a mystery) cheesy music and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere.<br /><br />Overall this movie is crap. Just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place.',neg
'i think dirty dancing was a great movie they tried to make another one havana nights which was good but it was nothing like dirty dancing. i would like to see another dirty dancing with the same people. without them i think it would be a mess. a lot of times movies are made then when they try to add on more they start to change the people an make the movies go down hill. i would love to see dirty dancing have another one to see what happened after they were able to be together. patrick an Jennifer did so well together. this movie was made in 1997 its time to make another one. but this time start where it left off an keep the same people in it.',pos
'No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson himself you cant deny that this video is the most unique video of all time. There is no other video that is even remotely close to Thriller The first time I saw it was when I was 6 years old and it scared me bad. Now I watch it with a smile because I can now appreciate the marvel that it is. I love this video and it will be around for as long as music videos exist. I think everyone should sit down and watch it when its on sometime and look back and see how great it was especially for being 1983.',pos
'People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who havent seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes but they are REALISTIC mistakes which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now. Someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves. Same goes for Kelly Bishop who plays Emily Gilmore so perfectly. Also its nice to see a show that can have a young girl at the center of it and not be filled with teen angst. Rory is a smart girl which is also not seen a lot on television today. If only other shows could capture the wholeness of this show...',pos
'Beating the bad guys... Again is the tag line for this movie it exposes so much truth about it.<br /><br />Home Alone one and two film classics. Home Alone three and four a good film if youre three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl as hard as it tries to be funny its not. Culkin is replaced by Alex DLinz or something else. Hes a very bland actor with bland performances but its not entirely his fault the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions. The pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks and youd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real. A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day. And to make things worst a totally different cast go see if you dont believe me but youll regret it.',neg
'I have loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979. Im still amazed at how accurately Kurt Russell portrays Elvis right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face. Sometimes its scary how much he looks acts and talks like the real Elvis. Thankfully this is being released on DVD so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film. I have heard the detractors who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out but I think that keeping in mind that John Carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work with and that this was being shown on television (just two years after Elviss death!) that he did a fine job with this. In fact I havent seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to this one. Highly recommended.',pos
'I thought this was very different compared to most modern interpretations of Shakespeare and enjoyed it thoroughly. It would not be useful for those studying it at school etc. as it does not show the traditional Shakespeare character interpretations (i.e- Miranda is portrayed quite punky compared to your traditional Shakespeare lady) but for understanding of the play and for the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and fantastic to watch. It does not include also the correct format as in the layout of acts and scenes as I am currently playing Miranda in a production and most of her lines had been cut and some scenes split and mixed around but it is very useful and I would definitely recommend it as a must-see even if just to say youve seen it! Shakespeare fans would love this!',pos
'Transylvania 6-5000 is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80s horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script. Two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent very much against their will to Transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film like a little guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table. The wholesome of the film however is not as successful as it could and should have been with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong. The Roger Corman production Transylvania Twist which came out four years after this is a lot funnier and much more recommended. The film is particularly parodying the classic Universal milestones of the early 30s so you better make sure youve seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references. Theres a pretty original twist indicating that the Frankenstein character only behaves like a mad-raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory. Its also revealed that hes actually more of a Father Damien sort of messiah whos only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters. Michael Richards the freaky guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. Im pretty sure John Turturros character in Mr. Deeds was inspired by Richardss role here.',neg
'The movie starts out fine. Widower out with new girlfriend and the children.<br /><br />The movie is filled with stupid directors choices. Like lets separate. I am coming down to.... do what? Stupid Stupid Stupid.<br /><br />Please do not waste your time hoping that it will get better.............. Not hardly.',neg
'The earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite. Although Turturro is an actor I generally like his Luzhin often resembled a bad Rain Man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying. Overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances.',neg
'The premise is simple. This movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport then things take a 180 degree turn...<br /><br />I for one really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater. And it is my humble opinion that Wes Craven based on his previous meta-horror films (Sceam) does too...<br /><br />Following this logic its not surprising to find that Craven sardonically takes his time to built up a nauseatingly sweet sependipity love-story only to have an AWESOME Cillian Murphy wreck that whole sugar-coated dreamworld... <br /><br />The scope of his character Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper get it? lame right?) in this film is impressive he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko which is a plus in my book. As he proceeds to freak out his victim (Jennifer Garner lookalike Rachel McAdams who I found pretty annoying by the way) you cant help but sympathize with the guy...<br /><br />This is Wes Craven embodied in Jackson Ripner through Cillian Murphy bashing all brainless chick flicks...<br /><br />Mr. Craven I salute you.<br /><br />Best quote:<br /><br />Jackson Ripner (after beating the snot out of Rachel McAdams in the airplane toilet): Thanks for the quickie!!!',pos
'Ive seen a lot of stupid plotlines in my time but this one is among the worst. After catching some disease in space an astronaut comes back to Earth and starts melting. He then goes on a rampage killing people (how is beyond me; I just watch them I cant explain them.) This is the kind of movie that shouldnt have been made in the first place.',neg
'One of the many silent comedies Stan Laurel featured in before he teamed with Oliver Hardy Mud and Sand is a ho-hum hokum. The story is badly disjointed - though this could be because of the modern-day edit - and the humor itself is not at all inventive.<br /><br />Potential plotlines are started and ignored; for instance Stans promise to make Fillet de Sole pay for what shes done to him never comes to fruition. Stans character doesnt seem very centered either but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed Stanley of Laurel & Hardy fame so it might be that I was just expecting to see this shortcoming.<br /><br />I strongly believe that all the silent films should be preserved and viewed and Im glad this one is still available. Its just not a great film.',neg
'Without wishing to be a killjoy Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films ive ever seen - this being one of them and Camp Blood being another. <br /><br />The acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself. Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />I bought this for £1 but remember you cant put a price on 71 minutes of your life. Youd do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price.',neg
'I am a great fan of Martin Amis on whose book this film is based. Unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen. The novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development. It is an hilarious examination of human greed excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary British writers. The director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel. In his hands the film screams along at breakneck speed indulging in every known trick shot and odd camera angle possible. It is like Ken Russel on acid and suffers from that older directors self indulgence cranked up to a hundred. Not even the (brief) glimpse of gorgeous actor Christian Solimenos penis was enough to save this wretched film for me. Abysmal!',neg
'The funniest show ever on TV albeit the humor is not for everyone. I realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer but its a shame only six episodes were filmed. The gags fly rapidly from the opening credits until the very end when you would see Drebin and his boss Ed Hocken pretending to be in freeze frame as the closing credits rolled during which the criminal (still moving) would see everyone else motionless and try to escape. In another episode the building started collapsing around them as Drebin and Hocken remained in freeze mode.<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen was comedic brilliance as Frank Drebin and the perfect fit for this show  how he managed to keep a straight face through some of this is beyond me. Because the jokes and sight gags came so often and quick you can watch the episodes a 2nd and 3rd time and catch things you missed the first time. If youre like me you can watch them over and over and still find yourself laughing. Even the jokes that made no sense nor seemingly had any reason to them such as the Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln tag-line in the opening announcement somehow worked  perhaps they were thrown in there precisely for that reason.<br /><br />Cleverly spoofing the old Quinn Martin detective/cop shows of the 1970s Police Squad would return from commercial break with the words Act Two appearing on the screen which was immediately followed by Yankees One or some other quip. On the opening credits the episodes title would appear on the screen but the announcer would utter a completely different title. My favorite jokes and lines from this series are way too numerous to list but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks a down-on-his-luck boxer who has previously tanked fights Do you think you can beat the Champ? The boxer responds I can take him blindfolded! To which Drebin responds back But what if hes not blindfolded? A minute later in reference to the boxers small dingy apartment Drebin tells him Im going to help you get out of this sewer. The next thing you see Drebin is popping up through a manhole cover on the street! In another episode Drebin and Hocken are questioning a bombing suspects flimsy alibi. Drebin not believing him says Alright lets say you did go the movies. After a slight pause Drebin Hocken and the suspect all look at the camera and in unison say You did go the movies. A few moments later when Drebin is forced to let the suspected bomber walk free due to lack of evidence he storms away and angrily yells Tell that bomber to take off! Whats seen next is a cop giving the thumbs-up signal to a WWII-style plane on a runway right outside the building! While there were many classic Drebin quotes one particularly memorable one was Sorry to bother you Mrs. Twice. We would have come earlier but your husband wasnt dead then. Another classic was Im a locksmith  and Im a locksmith. When a visibly shaken kidnap victims father asks Drebin What I do I do?  Drebin in classic deadpan fashion responds back Well as I understand it youre in the textile business. As I said the humor is not for everyone  many people simply will not get it. During the shows brief run I remember the reaction being very mixed. Some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things around while others thought it was the stupid and unfunny. For me Police Squad even 20+ years later is the funniest thing Ive ever seen on TV. For younger viewers who enjoy this type of humor but who have never seen Police Squad because they were too young when the series initially aired I highly recommend. I found the six episodes to be even funnier than the subsequent Naked Gun movies.',pos
'One of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene. I have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing having tied my own flies and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive Brown Trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them.<br /><br />When we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were in.<br /><br />This was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons Norman and Pauly carried out the ritual. For there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes. You cant just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best. You have to attune yourself to the place you are in you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and depending on your skill level you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike. The Art of Fly-fishing was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists.<br /><br />The title for the film could not be more aptly chosen for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons. This film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in Montana by the the Blackfoot river where the film is played out. It has the capacity to draw you in to enthrall you to capture you as the history of the family community and period is unfolded. The Story told is not just a family history but a history of Life. What may be classified as a River of Life',pos
'This is an excellent film!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman performed great!I was really surprised when Newman was beating on his son!That was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good.I was very surprised about the end.Rent this film today as it is one of Tom Hanks best!',pos
'Man was I disappointed.<br /><br />1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller from Friends <br /><br />2) A great cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars Alan Arkin Ed McMahon Pat Morita Louis Nye) with this amateurish script.<br /><br />3) The movie suffers from horrible pacing. It jumps around through in a jumbled confusing manner.<br /><br />4) The story doesnt even make sense. Why does he want to break the football streak? What about the stupid violin music? None of it is explained.<br /><br />5) Its not even funny. Its like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv saying Lookit me! Lookit me Im being funny! This was a bad attempt at making another Love At First Bite.<br /><br />I like Larry Cohen movies but man he failed here. I couldnt wait for the credits to roll. Horribly disappointed.',neg

'This was one of the best shows ever made for TV. Full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. Compulsive viewing. I was lucky I saw this in the UK. They might have got the episode order wrong I cant remember but it at least was on at a regular time every week. My girlfriend and I got hooked from the trailer in and neither of us is a big fan of American series normally.<br /><br />After the pilot we knew this was something special. We missed a couple of episodes and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol.<br /><br />Great casting superb acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant better even than his role as Custer. Lucas Black turned in an amazing performance for a kid and Paige Turco was at her best too since Party of Five. And Nick Searcy of course as the Sheriffs long suffering sidekick.<br /><br />Yes there were some confusing and perplexing bits which I presume would have been explained later and no doubt would have been in a later series. That made the ending weak and you could tell theyd killed it. Made us go WHAT? Why did they do that with one of the best shows ever? Shoot the exec.',pos
'Being an American service member please believe me when I say that this movie in no way accurately portrays the emotional state of our Soldiers/Sailors/Airmen/Marines returning from deployments.<br /><br />That being said....<br /><br />This movie is one large steaming pile of cliché. The acting as awful (with the exception of the little girl) the characters backgrounds are weak and laughable and plot is ludicrous.<br /><br />This movie is so bad I made an account with IMDb just to warn anyone with half a brain away from it.<br /><br />Canadian writer/director Francesco Lucente should be really really really ashamed of this movie. If he disagrees with US foreign policy he should write a letter to the US government not punish the entire English speaking world with a monumentally crap film.',neg
'This horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist sexist and homophobic all at once while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated. Atrocious performances a cliche ridden screenplay and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of. Two scenes were especially offensive - the one in which Schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man (could it really have been that gross) and the scene where Eastwood is kissed by Schaechs best friend who is pretending to be Russian. After he leaves the room she exclaims f**king foreigners! So much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in Paris!?!<br /><br />Jonathon Schaech can be a likeable actor on screen and is astonishingly good-looking. Its a shame he didnt learn more from working with cutting edge gay director Gregg Araki on an earlier film and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia.',neg
'This is one of those movies that you just dont want to end. The characters are rich like a well woven tapestry. Colorful costumes music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is taken in by a dynamic big-hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences.<br /><br />I couldnt believe this was a made for television film. It was so well executed. S. Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as Nanny and she brings so much life to this role. You want to be right there amongst her boarders.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film so much I bought the DVD.',pos
'Due to rather dubious plate tectonics Japan starts to slip under the sea. Initial predictions say itll take about 40 years before the country is submerged but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines it will actually take less than 1 year! The government think hes a crackpot but evidence soon starts bearing his theory out.<br /><br />This big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of Hollywood films of the late 90s (I assume having seen none of them) with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human (well Japanese) spirit in acts of heroism and sacrifice and proving the power of love or something like that. i.e. its as naive in its psychology as its geology... we all know that half the populace would be out raping and looting the minute they thought the police had their back turned and the other half would just panic and be useless.<br /><br />The film does have some very nice special effects but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent Hollywood production would be. It is at least as nationalistic humourless and lacking in self-awareness as that Hollywood film would be though and probably has even worse acting. It does have the hot evil chick from Battle Royale as one of the leads... but shes not even slightly evil and is therefore much less hot.<br /><br />The film is much too long at 132 minutes and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking. I certainly didnt care in the slightest whether Japan sank or not by the half way point and well before the end I was trying to think of ways to expedite the process should I ever find myself in that situation for real.<br /><br />But it does have nice special effects and Kou Shibasaki is still pretty hot so I magnanimously give it... 3/10.',neg
'Found this film in a DVD discount rack for $10. It wasnt worth it. Some of the camera work and dialog look and sound as if it were done by a film student. Sandras performance was somewhat credible but the film was predictable and the action was spotty and dragged.<br /><br />One thing that I will give them however. Unlike most action films people in this film actually ran out of ammo and scavanged dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition.',neg
'A group of obnoxious teens go to a former funeral parlor for a Halloween party. They get trapped inside and become possessed by demons that they have accidentally awakened. The possessed teens start killing the others off and seem to be led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) who floats and talks in a really deep voice. The remaining teens that havent been possessed yet are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house.<br /><br />This is a pretty decent horror film with great special effects which include Linnea Quigley (who has a couple nude scenes as usual) gouging out a guys eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into her nipple. Theres also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out. This is a great film to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza. The terrible acting and atrocious dialog almost ruins it though. Overall I would give it a 7 out of 10.',pos
'Walter Matthau and George Burns just work so well together. The acidity of Willy with the perplexed amnesic Al is a mixture made in heaven. The scene when they meet again in Willys flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection. Walter Matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization. George Burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable. Watch for the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask something of the Spanish caretaker and Als reaction - priceless.',pos

'Michael Caton-Joness Scottish period piece bears little connection to the Sir Walter Scott novel of the same name...<br /><br />The film opens in the Scottish highlands with Robert Roy McGregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of His Lordship James Grahams cattle... The scene then switches to a sword-fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs adorned shirts soft colored coats paleface make-up and conventional gestures...<br /><br />MacGregor lives under the protection of a local lord named Marquis of Montrose... When he enters an ill-advised trade agreement with Montrose he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of Montroses evil-doers... The unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape... When Rob Roy is finally compelled to rebel against the English soldiers the action becomes well understood ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade...<br /><br />Liam Neeson injects heroism and passion to his character... He is intelligent fair and virile... He carries his height with grace as the Scottish chieftain of a small community... He is a loving father a passionate lover and a noble husband driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains... Hed rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust... <br /><br />Oscar winner Jessica Lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife a proud peasant woman brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat... Langes lines are filled with dignity and integrity: I will think on you dead until my husband makes you so. And then I will think on you no more.<br /><br />John Hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make Montrose something more than a greedy Marquis ruthless with money and tempered by the English courts fashion for foppery... He is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service... Honor in his view seems a quaint notion... He has two objectives: ruin the reputation of his rival the Duke of Argyle and to hunt down the fugitive MacGregor... He sends his soldiers to burn the Highlanders homes to kill their people and their livestock...<br /><br />Tim Roththe perfect antithesis to the hero is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer... He is a penniless British aristocrat a nasty hired sword wonderfully evil ravishing and murdering his way through the Scottish mist... His name is Archibald Cunningham... He turns out to be a liar a thief and a murderer... He dismisses himself as but a bastard abroad seeking his fortune and the favors of great men and therefore cant care about anyone else: Love is a dung hill and I am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow. He even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl...<br /><br />Cunningham seems pathetic...

'Just got back from the European Premiere of The Gamers: Dorkness Rising.<br /><br />All I can say is that if you are a gamer (CRPG RPG or LARP) then this movie is for you. And if youre not a gamer? Well its still a great deal of fun.<br /><br />The acting is certainly not Oscar-worthy but in the whole element of the movie it adds to the charm. The humour is everywhere along with some very nice touches (the tribute to Gary Gygax is especially well done if you can spot it). The cast are very down to earth in their appearance befitting the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying an ordinary hobby.<br /><br />The quality of the movies sound and vision are adequate but again it all just adds to the atmosphere that helps to define this movie as being the Dungeons and Dragons movie written and performed by gamers for gamers.<br /><br />Not afraid to use terminology specific to one system they still manage to allow product placement to be a part of the movie but in a very understandable and utterly fair manner. It also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some gamers can have about other gamers and deals with that quite well.<br /><br />All in all the movie is very much driven by an well-thought-out equal balance of character plot and entertainment (the Bard is amazingly good value-for-money).<br /><br />In the end it does make scoring this movie quite hard so I have given it 2 scores.<br /><br />Score (for non-RPers): 7/10 (A few moments could go way over your head but the main sections of the movie just work so hard and achieve so much more.)<br /><br />Score (for RPers): 10/10 (Everything fits together in the perfect quantities and with the perfect charm and sentiment)',pos
'Whatever happened to Keaton is what I want to know.<br /><br />Actually I dont I crawled away heaving thinking she must owe half the bookies in Vegas or maybe not maybe she was just brainwashed blackmailed and bored to death. Rich enough to adopt a third-world country she somehow had to star in yet another cookie-cut cliché-ridden droolathon based on the same character-franchise shes been rehashing since Father of the Bride(91). Youd think shes going head to head with Mr.Bean.<br /><br />(Spoilers) <br /><br />So hubby (Dax) gets fired by obnoxious son of boss his mom (Keaton)leaves his dad after classic row and crashes over with her own dog-show in tow oh those little rascals. Hubbys got cold-feet for diaper-duty wifeys clock a-ticking and hey lets toss in a space-cadet as second house-guest for good measure all in one day because thats so funny and original. Wife gets fed up and walks away mom leaves dad for space-cadet and the couple makes up in time for closing credits 86 very long minutes later.<br /><br />Now if you have to have a space-cadet he cant be devious as well he cant scheme some excuse for his stayover and if mom leaves dad she cant hop into a cab dressed as a pumpkin just because some scriptwriter agonized over how to cheer thing up. <br /><br />Plus that gag whereby they invite her in only to then discover shes got her canine entourage in the cab has got to be outlawed by now. And you only get one obnoxious 2-dimensional boss to denigrate. Another movie-killer would be the movie-script the space cadet is toiling away at supposedly more lame than the actual one again dejas-ad-nausea.<br /><br />Liv Tyler doesnt seem happy here her voice was weird at times it had me wondering if they later had her redub some of it and shes a smart one shes handled great roles and well forgive her for Jersey Girl it was disaster-prone could happen to anyone.

Peter Weller and Robert Patrick star and are quickly wasted in this going nowheres fast mercenaries-for-hire action dud where the story is pretty darn bad and the action sucks and whats the point of watching an action flick if the action blows? Robert Patrick in particular hits a new low in an action sequence that has him firing a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus.

'I recently saw I.Q. and even though Im not a romantic comedy type of gal I think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch. So many movies in my opinion lack honesty. You know that feeling when youre watching a movie and you just feel robbed because its taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash? The story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one. How they stuck together and they tried to help Tim Robbins character become smart. I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love nothing is what it seems. I would recommend this for a Sunday morning.<br /><br />7/10',pos

'The plot of Edison was decent but one actor in particular ruined the entire film. Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie. He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. squad. <br /><br />Whether it was an emotional scene an action scene or even a silent scene Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it. <br /><br />Do not waste your time watching this film. Dont even bother downloading it midget porn would be a much better choice.<br /><br />And Justin if youre reading this stick to music. Even though youre no good at that youve done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing.',neg
'The episode begins with scenes of a dead woman bather washed up on the shore a forlorn Jim strolling along the beach lost in reverie and a night ride home that ends in murder and mystery. Yepthis is an atmospheric little number with a super twist at the end. Jim does well to unravel what is a priori an inexplicable case of a woman going missing 20 seconds after she enters her home. To be sure the eventual explanation is a little far-fetched. Why for example go to the lengths of substituting a woman midway thru a car journey when simply rubbing her AND her companions out wouldve been as easy and left less of a trail. However these niggles aside its a memorable TRF episode full of invention even if YET AGAIN Jim gets put in the frame by an ever suspicious Police Dept.

'Its gonna be hard to make this fill 10 lines.... But ill give it a try (just to prevent others from making the same mistake as i did - to watch this (awful and boring) movie.<br /><br />I like Patrick swayze - he did a excellent performance in films like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South (TV series) but in this movie..... ARGH....This movie is so booooooring the acting is awful - the script sucks - well.. i cant even find ONE good thing nothing absolutely NOTHING. I was watching it with 2 other friends and we all agreed that this was one of the most boring films we had ever seen and the fact that it lasts for more then 3 hours (which we didnt know) - when part 1 was over and it said to be continued we almost cried nooooooooooooo do we have to watch 90 minutes more of this movie!!!!.<br /><br />Its painful to see this movie: At no time do you get the impression that the actors are Russians the action scenes are extremely bad. The ONLY good scene is when the truck explodes in the beginning of the movie! The rest is CRAP! GO clean your toilet instead of watching this movie (and dont come running crying if you do see this movie - you were pre warned!) Personally i would recommend Patrick Swayze to call his agent and have them recall this movie - its that bad.',neg
'This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.<br /><br />I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. Ive often wanted to see the movie again but couldnt even remember its name and have never seen it in the rental stores.<br /><br />James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.',pos
'I love this film Spring and port wine. I was born in Leigh a town about 7 miles away from Bolton I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20. My place of work was daily via Little Lever through Farnworth sometimes on a bike but then by car when I could afford it.The film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always broke but who would always help you if they could. Fred Dibnah was round the corner from Bromwich St. were my bedsit was. If you didnt see the film when first released then you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap such as Coronation St well I agree it is a soap but then it was called Kitchen Sink Drama! Watch this film for the talented cast who shortly afterwards became household names from frequent roles on TV I watch mainly for the shots of the locality and the feel good factor of people being poor but happy!',pos
'CAT SOUP has two Hello Kitty-type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife where anything can happen and does. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in and also ride. But like practically everything else in this film that silly picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end.',pos
'Kate Beckinsale is as good if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this movie although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the other Emma version. Theyre both good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale as Emma seems more interesting almost though. And I liked the woman who played Harriet Smith in this movie better too...she was more believably sweet and sentimental. There are certain things I like better about the Gwyneth Paltrow version though like how the humorous side is more apparent.',pos
'If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece told with depth and subtlety and passion a film with no equal in the visual realm. It is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation. And of course what the reviewers could not abide is it doesnt tell a simple narrative dick-and-jane tale like 99\% of hollywood output. Its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts fears and emotions. They even appear to be thinking something your average movie reviewers do not understand and cannot abide so they destroyed it. See the original uncut wide-screen version. It is stunning.',pos
'The script is nice.Though the casting is absolutely non-watchable.No style. the costumes do not look like some from the High Highbury society. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Ms. Beckinsale speaks British English better than Ms. Paltrow though in Ms. Paltrows acting lies the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam undoubtedly is the best Mr. Knightley of all versions he is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unfeeling like Mr. Knightley in the TV-version. P.S.The spectator cannot see at all Mr. Elton-Ms. Smith relationships development as it was in the motion version so one cannot understand where was all Emmas trying of make a Elton-Smith match (besides of the portrait).',neg
'In Cold Blood adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capotes famous novel deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals. The film excels as a character study of the killers particularly trigger-man Perry Smith (Robert Blake).<br /><br />The cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities. They play off of each other effortlessly while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his characters idiosyncrasies. The rest of the cast is merely average and isnt worth remarking on.<br /><br />Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction. In my opinion both were excellent though the script does miscalculate with some ill-advised narration in the late stages. The Oscar-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top-notch as is the editing. Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the films four Oscar nominations.<br /><br />Unlike so many other crime films this one doesnt glamorize violence. Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled.',pos
'I am a huge fan of the original Assault On Precinct 13. The ice cream scene haunts me to this day. Im 33 now and I still remember being horrified by it as a child. When I heard they were remaking it I thought it might be good but when I saw the film its 100\% not the same film. Its not a remake. Its a bad stolen idea. It was completely ruined. The cast Maria Bello Laurence Fishburne Ethan Hawke Gabriel Burne John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are all great actors but even they couldnt save this film. It was just wrong. Even the setting was completely opposite. And how in the hell did no one in that city notice that there was a war going on next door? Why didnt help show up sooner? Stupid. No sense.',neg

'First of all the nature in the movie is beautiful and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well the horses looked Mongolian and the camels but thats about all what was Mongolian in it. Oh Borte is played by a Mongolian actress albeit a lame performance. But she is pretty which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part.<br /><br />But I totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful-to- watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by Mr.Bodrov. The plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion. There was no logic behind the development of the plot. In fact there was hardly any story at all just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in Mongolian clothes speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like Mongolian. Most actors were either Japanese Russian or Chinese most scenes were shot in China Kazakhstan or Russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a Mongolian. The dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow. The battle scenes are laughable. All the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story.<br /><br />The Japanese actor was like a wooden doll and looking at him one wouldnt get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. He looked sleepy soft stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie.<br /><br />And I dont even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste. To see Chinggis-khan half of the movie as a slave to see his two first kids be born from other men to see his wife selling herself to the Tangut merchant... my blood starts to boil. And where is the beautiful story about the friendship between Temujin and Jamukha? One could make a great movie out of it. Where is the story of the rise of Temujin? Of his childhood of his relationship with his family with his brothers of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family? where is Van khan who helped him a lot? where is the depiction of life in the steppe of the life of the nomads of their traditions of their relations with the other nations around them?<br /><br />Where is development of the characters? We totally fail to see what brought Temujin together with Jamukha and what brought them apart and most important how Temujin became Chinggis-khan how he an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the Mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history. All this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters but unfortunately we didnt see any of it in Bodrovs creation not even a glimpse.',neg
'Once the slow beginning gets underway the film kicks off and really becomes quite a lot of fun in many unexpected ways. The ensemble cast is really good with Heather Graham perhaps being the weakest of them. Casey Affleck as her brother is really good and extremely likeable  if you catch my drift.<br /><br />I highly recommend the film if you just want to have to good hours. Teenagers should really enjoy this film - it says a lot about relationships.',pos
'Dire. Just dire. The script is contrived the acting painful and the story just drags along. It is without a doubt a celebration of Sally Potter and little else. This wouldnt be so bad but shes the director writer and star of the film and so is just self-glorification. I found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters and the ending came not a moment too soon. It has two redeeming features. First is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely particularly in Paris and look rather good in black and white. Secondly whether youre a fan of tango or not the music is by and large excellent (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this film at your own risk or if you need an unintentional laugh. I am sure it appeals to someone. Statistically it has to.',neg
'This is almost the worst film you will ever see! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one for me. The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once referred to as cheepnis. It looks as if the space scenes were made in a 1950s power station just prior to demolition. The music really sucks. The acting is wooden and ham. The characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of direction beggars belief.<br /><br />But you have to see it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever. This is a priceless example of a stupid movie!',neg
'As a massive fan of the three TV series I was very interested to learn that LoG were moving onto the big screen. In my more honest moments though I had my doubts about the likely success of the concept and whether the writers would be able to sustain the high level of wit comedy and horror that infuse the original series.<br /><br />Unfortunately my fears were not unfounded and the film was a huge disappointment. I struggle to understand the other comments on this site. Obviously people are entitled to their opinions but the guys I watched it with all agree with me and they are just as big fans as I am.<br /><br />The acting lacked conviction but they are so good that even when not at their best they are still highly watchable. The main problem was the plot - and the script. There were a few laughs but not enough a few moments of disgust but not enough. Worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after walking out of the cinema. So rarely have I felt so utterly uninspired by a film and so unmotivated to discuss it with others.<br /><br />I write this comment as a warning to other League fans - get a wide range of opinion on this film before going to see it. If you love League you might be able to convince yourself that they didnt totally mess up their move to cinema. If you cant convince yourself of this then you will have tarnished in your mind the otherwise spotless genius that exemplifies the TV series.<br /><br />LoG at the cinema? More like log.

'Well let me put it this way - I have always been one of the hardcore brothers; Ive always loved rock music and especially heavy metal!! Thats why this movie is like a gift from God!

Its great to hear all the classics like Long live rock and roll (DIO) Stranglehold (Ted Nugent) songs by Jon Bon Jovie Deep Purple AC/DC Zakk Wylde and several other legendary rock bands. Heavenly! Absolutely gorgeous! WONDERFUL!!! I hope they will make more movies like this (otherwise its just crap movies like that AC in da USA or what they call it and 8 miles. Bulls***!).

'This is a cult classic for sure!!<br /><br />It is tricky to follow at times but then again so is a film like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club. If you want standard fare then i figure go rent the Care Bears Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic. But if you want  to view the world differently then i would say open yourself up to Enigmas and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think.<br /><br />For me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout. So while i have seen some complaints all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy.',pos
'The movie shocked me. Personally i had herd mostly bad buzz. Well finally after owning the DVD for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night. though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes. The best thing about the movie is its consistency with the relationship. There were no exs popping up or characters threatening the relationship. I mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fatethey datesomething we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this movie did not follow that mold. We actually experienced the relationship and its flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti-love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again. i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies. The story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern times.And it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also. Its no My fair lady but it is a spirited and honest film. Ill simply say i like it.',pos
'THE DECOY is one of those independent productions made by obvious newcomers but it doesnt have all the usual flaws that sink most such films. It has a definite story it has adequate acting the photography is very good the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men and the background music isnt overdone. This is a DVD New Release so people will be looking here to see if its worthwhile. I dont know where all the 10s come from as theres no way this film is that good --- even if youre the filmmakers mother. <br /><br />The last film we saw at a theater was Warners trashing of J K Rawlings much-loved and excellent book Order of the Phoenix. In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX consider that PHOENIX (as made by Warners) had no story certainly no acting was allowed by the director the photography was dreadful and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a 1 because the scale doesnt go any lower. THE DECOY is 4 times better -- in all regards.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity give THE DECOY a chance. Remember this isnt Decoy 3 -- the Shootout or any such nonsense. Its original. If your expectations arent overblown by the foolish 10 scores here you might just enjoy the film on its own terms.',neg
'I have to admit I have a particular penchant for the humor and story telling style of British movies though not all of course succeed.<br /><br />This film made me think and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face. Its about character development and relationships truth and lies and whether love is sometimes simply not enough. Some very nicely understated acting from all the participants especially the two leads Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson.<br /><br />There was a lot of fuss made about Gosford Park but with this piece I feel Fellowes has actually produced a better movie though it has not been a mainstream release.<br /><br />An intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed but also capable of acts of genuine graciousness.',pos
'There are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set. That 70s Show is a great example. When the show came on the air nobody really heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests) I wish Topher would stay around because the show began about his character Eric and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time. Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland from Eight Is Enough think of Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it. I miss Mo Gaffney who played Dons girlfriend Joanne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie the replacement could not match her and I am sorry about that. I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to Steven Hyde. I loved watching Tanya Roberts besides Charlies Angels. I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackies mom. She really showed her acting talent before heading to Broadway. This show has been a delight with many surprises. I hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but I hope they dont stay too far away too long. I wish the shows creators Bonnie and Terry Turner who also created my other favorite show Third Rock from The Sun is more successful on Fox than they were on NBC which sabotaged their show. The Turners are not dummies and I hope they create more shows like this in the future.',pos
'I honestly dont know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review as a result Im having a hard time describing these shorts. Lets just say theres a good amount of gay sex some necrophilia some incest a fair amount of masturbation and several artificial.... members. And I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />Not that its ALL crude humor. It isnt. They stray away from fart gags for the most part with the exception of one sketch entitled Pizza in which they use one very well. They being 3/11ths of the short-lived sketch comedy group that aired on MTV called The State namely David Wain Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black.<br /><br />The trio go on adventures usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people people that are often actually more normal than they are. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Paul Rudd Julie Bowen Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis and Sam Rockwell all make appearances in various sketches. Theyre also joined by other The State alums like Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek. The musical selections are also very well placed.<br /><br />Ive enjoyed these sketches over and over again but they arent for everybody as theyre pretty vulgar most of the time. If you like clever humor that isnt afraid to push the limits of good taste then I highly recommend this. If you liked Wet Hot American Summer (Directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or The State then you should really enjoy this.<br /><br />I think it can currently only be ordered online. Check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first and then find out how to buy the DVD.',pos
'I saw this when on The Wonderful World of Disney as a kid so I didnt recall much of it. As I watched it recently I sat there thinking This is the weirdest thing Ive seen.<br /><br />The traveling scenes look like something caused by an LSD overdose. The animated characters are mostly oddly colored/voiced versions of Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters. Some not-so-Disney things I noticed: kids being threatened at knife point and prostitutes(during the Portobello Road song).<br /><br />It was very entertaining though the musical numbers were long and I can see little kids getting bored with them. Also the subject manner was a bit dark seeing as it was set during WW2.',pos
'I had no idea what the film is about before I saw it because Tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that It is the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the screenplays for Dhoom 1 & 2 and Saif Ali Khans son Ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback.<br /><br />After watching it I understood that why their wasnt a proper trailer because there wasnt anything in the film to show. The story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story-line. There was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and its difficult to figure out that who is killing who. Also the action was daft & unrealistic e.g. 1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns.<br /><br />While I was watching Tashan it reminded me of 3 films:<br /><br />Sin City: During the opening credits.<br /><br />Koyla: Anil Kapoors terrible English like Amrish Puri in Koyla.<br /><br />Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny.<br /><br />I also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I dont know where all the money went to. Anyway if you did not like Dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan. Race was hot on heels and that is a million times better.<br /><br />The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film? Even Anil Kapoors terrible English couldnt save this discomfiture.',neg
'When I saw LAUREN BACALL do CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway I never dreamed that one day I would see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN playing the Bacall role on screen. But here Ingrid really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretending to be WALTER MATTHAUs wife so he can go on with the fib hes told GOLDIE HAWN.<br /><br />Its a story played for laughs from beginning to end good-humored stuff that never runs out of dry humor and wit throughout its running time. There are plenty of one-liners or gags that are way above the usual situation comedy stuff one hears on TV--the lines ring true because they blend so well with the characters and their motives.<br /><br />As the daffy girl who contemplates (in the beginning) committing suicide over her unhappy affair with Matthau GOLDIE HAWN (fresh from her days as a star on TVs Laugh In) does a dumb blonde role to perfection. Easy to see why she won that Supporting Actress Oscar.<br /><br />Ingrid is surprisingly fetching in a rare comedy role although there are times when she seems just a bit too matronly for the part. At any rate shes a surprising choice to play the nurse who puts on a freeze act at the office but is considerably warmer off duty.<br /><br />As Goldies next door neighbor Igor Rick Lenz acquits himself admirably and makes a suitable match for her in that final scene.<br /><br />Matthau plays the kind of character that became his stock in trade in all those Neil Simon roles he had--a lovable cad who gets caught up in his own messes when he tells lie after lie.<br /><br />Its the kind of rib-tickling comedy thatll have you laughing out loud at some of the amusing lines that Abe Burrows and I.A.L. Diamond have managed to scrap together based on a French farce.',pos
'I gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews. After seeing the trailer I thought - what an unfunny movie full of clichés. But I decided to give it a shot because trailers often dont portray the movie very well. What a waste of time... The movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it I couldnt recall one single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the CSI parodies but that also is pretty passé. I couldnt relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because I found them utterly stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. Unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally.',neg
'1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): Fast-paced frantic animation effort by Ted Turners feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains. Im not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about. Mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to Disney efforts like Aladdin and Lion King. Dont let this fool you -- there is no comparison in story or quality.',neg
'I of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other Lions Gate extravaganza so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing. And it is to a point. A young college student (Sarah)is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them and in doing so shes unwittingly becoming involved in some game. Now thats fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like myself) will most likely become frustrated. Characters appear with little introduction and youre not really sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or is hanging out with them. All of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that its all part of the design. In reality its all part of the very sketchy script and when the film is over youll find yourself feeling that youve lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time like cleaning the bathroom for instance. 4 out of 10.',neg
'I thought that it was a great film for kids ages 6-12. A little sappy but the story is uplifting an fresh. It proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true. I think that its a great story for any kid who is feelings down or feels as if there trying to juggle too many things among them. Very cute film. Bravo.',pos
'I watched the movie in a preview and I really loved it. The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious.

Its great.',pos
'I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted naturally and you felt for them in the respective roles. A glossy film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to todays world but now the sexes are on the same level women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January 2005. Pity scenes were cut prior to release - even at two hours you want more! I have registered with Amazon for the DVD (they do now have a special page). To view this film in CinemaScope after forty six years of pan and scan will be great. Twentieth Century Fox please look further into your catalogers of fifties CinemaScope productions for DVD - there IS a large market out there. I await arrival from US of March 2004 Vanity Fair Special article on the film which is said to be fifteen pages with many photos on set. Cheers.',pos
'Truly a great film... I stumbled onto it at the video store and rented it because Aaron Eckhart (In the Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors) was in it as well as Paulina Porizcova... The lovely former SI swimsuit model does get nude in the film but that is only one of the many reasons to rent it... Its very exciting and the character development is fantastic... Eckhart is one of the most underrated actors working and he steals this film... It is very dark and violent but I enjoyed in immensely....',pos
'I often wonder why this series was slammed so much. I thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and performed. I think in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves that is if they ever issue it. Many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and all went on to greater things. Maybe this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued. Sally Phillips Simon Pegg Peter Serafinowicz and not least Julian Rhind-Tutt of the hugely successful Green Wing. The writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the finest comedy writers of the modern age. Anyone that can produce comedy like Father Ted couldnt be capable of writing something not worthy of publication. If it is ever issued I will certainly buy it.',pos
'Moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorise. Its easiest to think of it as several snapshots of the lives of the two central characters. The fact that these characters are members of a street gang set in an multicultural city of the near future and that one of them is a vampire does not preclude them from having moments like any other people and this is one of the places where this movie is different to anything else Ive ever heard of. It doesnt get wrapped up in the fact that one of the main characters is a vampire its just something that has to be dealt with like any other problem. The way the characters interact is surprisingly realistic- there are embarrassing relatives and tricks that are meant to look cool that just dont work which leaves the film with a lovely sense of not taking itself too seriously for the most part.<br /><br />The other area that really stood out to me is the languages. The fictional city of Mallepa contains various cultural groups and characters speak the language that they would be expected to speak. Japanese gang members speak Japanese to each other but Chinese when talking to characters of Chinese descent. Possibly the most amusing exchange involves an Australian and is conducted in English. The actors of the four arguably main characters have three separate mother tongues between them and speak varying levels of each others languages so its quite a feat that the movie was made at all. Which I suppose brings me to the lead actors.<br /><br />Much has been made of the fact that the movie stars two of Japans biggest rockstars Gackt and Hyde as well as Taiwanese superstar Lee-hom Wang whether it is to praise them for their acting or criticise it or simply fangirl about them. In my opinion Lee-hom is the best at playing a straight and realistic character. However any lack of acting ability on Gackts part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being over-dramatic. I wasnt sure if Hydes character was supposed to be as sulky and sarcastic as he came across but it doesnt really detract from the movie either way.<br /><br />There are several scenes which take rather melodramatic turns which made it difficult for them to affect me much emotionally (Although this doesnt seem to stop a lot of people). I found its best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously- Its perfect for getting out and watching with a group of friends. It does have its flaws but overall it was very enjoyable and Id highly recommend it to anyone who doesnt mind a few subtitles.',pos
'After 10 viewings in 20 years I too think this was the Crazy Gangs best effort on film with more cohesion in the plot than their next best Alfs Button Afloat. They were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage sometimes in front of royalty until Chesney Allen retired in the 40s through ill-health. He outlived them all by years. Apparently they were just as mad outside work regularly playing practical jokes on one another.<br /><br />The Six Wonder Boys troupe head for Ill-Get-Her-To-Tell-Me (Alaska) to dig for the gold that was being found there. It seemed a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because theyd been there. When they get to Red Gulch they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date - they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper theyd read tasted funny. But by then it doesnt matter as theyve all fallen in love with Snow White and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold. Baddie Bill M McGrew wants it himself however.<br /><br />The number of verbal and visual puns is astonishing but most of them will probably only make sense(?) to Brits and ex-pats interested in seeing 30s British b&w comedies. Imho nearly all of the gags and routines work including the Gold If patter between Bud & Chesney and the Whistle While You Work pastiche - even the Always Getting Our Man Mountie inserts. A marvellous little film in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended.',pos
'I never was an avid viewer of Crocodile Hunter but did occasionally see an episode or a bit of an episode and when the news spread about Steve Irwins death from a stingray attack in 2006 it certainly caught my attention. This movie with Steve and his wife Terri playing themselves but in a fictional story was released in 2002 but I didnt hear of it until several years later and even after that it took me a while to get around to seeing it. Well now I have seen it and after looking here first (more than once) and seeing its rating I was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be though it could have been a BIT better. Apparently its supposed to be a comedy so a major problem with it is that it isnt very funny at all.<br /><br />A U.S. satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in Australia where it is swallowed by a crocodile! While Steve and Terri Irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy Brozzie Drewitt and are unaware of whats inside it two CIA agents are sent to Australia to retrieve the beacon! The agents are assisted by Jo Buckley and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them! On Steve and Terris mission they face other types of dangerous wildlife not just the crocodile and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it when Steve sees the CIA agents after them he mistakes them for poachers! <br /><br />Not only did I not laugh once while watching this film the only part that really made me smile was Steve Irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the CIA agents. Apart from that I dont think I found anything even mildly amusing. Its also a bit of an incoherent mess switching back and forth from the Australian Outback to the CIA headquarters and it seems like clips from Crocodile Hunter and clips from an action thriller (or something like that) put together for some reason. Also added to that mix are the ranch scenes which also seem to be from somewhere else and as funny as Brozzie Drewitt played by Magda Szubanski is supposed to be shes not. At one point we see her farting so we have a fart joke a MAJOR cliché in modern comedy! Are they SO hard to resist?! I also found the typical Crocodile Hunter scenes with Steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers to be tedious but I guess the fact that I was never a devout fan of the show didnt help.<br /><br />Steve Irwin was admired by many as a conservationist and is sadly missed by them while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him. No matter which side youre on The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course is not a well crafted movie. Im sure it does help if youre a big Steve Irwin fan but even if you are theres no guarantee that you would like this movie as some fans clearly havent been impressed. In fact it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than I have so maybe it WONT help. Like I said theres no guarantee. I would say whatever you may think of Steve Irwin and his show this movie was unnecessary. The attempt to combine what is usually seen in Crocodile Hunter with a fictional story unfortunately failed and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes!',neg
'After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite he made one of his worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During this first year in films Chaplin made about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libbing editing gags location shooting etc. This one takes place at a racetrack where Chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying. Mabel Normand is there with her friend also and Chaplin manages to rid himself of both his and Mabels friends. He then woos Mabel in the grandstand with no apparent repercussions from his behavior. Lots of slapstick in here but there is very little else to recommend this film for other then watching Chaplin develop. The print I saw was badly deteriorated which may have affected its enjoyment. Charley Chase can be glimpsed. * of 4 stars.',neg
'I really felt the movie was ahead of its time. The one potential daughter-in-law was such a strong career oriented woman. She knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but firm with the over-bearing mother-in-law to be. The mothers role was played extremely well (you just loved to hate her). Her need to control her sons lives was neurotically evil. If youve ever been in a relationship where youve been judged and found lacking (and everybody involved knew it) this may hit too close to home. Its been years since I saw this movie and I remember thinking that this plot and dialog would work in a 50s or 60s movie. It is difficult to watch because of the mother and sons dynamic but I would love to watch it again. I keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels but so far no luck. Attempts to buy it were also futile (I dont believe its on tape or DVD).',pos
'I guess this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle movie. I really liked him in his (title) role as a butcher boy. The way he moves is very funny in my opinion for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; his facial expressions really suit the role he plays for example how he winks at the audience in the end. But one might add that that was probably not too difficult. Anyway I think he would have deserved a longer career. As you probably know it was ruined by greedy journalists who made money by printing false accusations that said he was involved in a scandal.<br /><br />The plot is not very important. In the first half Fatty and Alum are employees at a store and rivals for Almondines affection. After a heavy food fight Almondine is sent to a girls school by her father the store owner. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both Fatty and Alum enter the school in drag and the fight for Almondine continues. (Some of the characters names are different in the version that I have seen. It seems that for some reason they replaced the original title cards with new ones.)<br /><br />There are a lot of corny gags like food fights and pratfalls but they are done well in my opinion. And there are some gags I really liked for example how they make the dog run the pepper mill (or is it a coffee mill?) or the scene when Fatty dons a coat although it is obviously not necessary or when Miss Teachem the head of the girls school spanks Fatty and he spanks her back.<br /><br />Buster Keaton is also funny in this his first movie; a good addition to the cast. In the first half he is a customer at the store in the second half he supports Alum in his fight for Almondine. I liked his acrobatics for example when Fatty pushes him from one room of the school to another he doesnt show a simple pratfall but lands on his hands and his head and does a little pirouette. Watch out for one scene in the food fight: Alum throws a flour bag at him but it misses and hits the store owner instead. That makes Buster laugh which must be a rarity since he normally always shows a neutral expression (which - as you probably also know already - got him the nickname The Great Stone Face). (One more note: Al St. John who plays Alum was Fatty Arbuckles nephew and later became famous for the role of Fuzzy that he played in lots of westerns.)<br /><br />I dont like this one as much as I like for example One Week and The Balloonatic (films that Buster made later without Fatty). And it didnt make me laugh out loud often - but it made me smile a lot so I have given it eight points.',pos
'EL MAR is a tough stark utterly brilliant brave work of cinematic art. Director Agustí Villaronga with an adaptation by Antoni Aloy and Biel Mesquida of Blai Bonets novel has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives. And though the focus is on wars heinous tattoo on children the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear. This film becomes one of the finest anti-war documents without resorting to pamphleteering: the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following childrens march toward adulthood.<br /><br />A small group of children are shown in the Spanish Civil War of Spain threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens. Ramala (Nilo Mur) Tur (David Lozano) Julia (Sergi Moreno) and Francisca (Victoria Verger) witness the terror of the assassination of men and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide. These wide-eyed children become adults carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds.<br /><br />We then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium. Ramala (Roger Casamajor) has survived as a male prostitute protected by his john Morell (Juli Mira) and has kept his life style private. Tur (Bruno Bergonzini) has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to Catholicism and the blur of delusional self-mutilation/crucifixion. Francisca (Antònia Torrens) has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium. The three are re-joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war. Tur longs for Ramalas love Ramala longs to be free from his Morell and Francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nuns habit.<br /><br />The setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death between lust and love and between devotion and destruction is played out. To detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved (in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film) and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable. For this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and Director Villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense. The actors both as children and as adults are splendid: Roger Cassamoor Bruno Bergonzini and Antònia Torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles. The cinematography by Jaime Peracaula and the haunting musical score by Javier Navarrete serve the directors vision. A tough film this but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath. In Spanish with English subtitles.<br /><br />Grady Harp',pos
'This is certainly a good film beautifully photographed and evocatively acted. Yet one should certainly criticize it and Mizoguchi for it is not without flaws and weaknesses. Mizoguchi really cared for women and wanted to make statements on mans lack of sympathy and total cruelty yet he sometimes gets ahead of himself in trying to make this statement by adopting the wrong means. This is certainly a case in the Crucified Lovers Princess Yang Kwei Fei and Zankiku monogatari. He sets the scenario in feudal Japan which leaves the viewer at the end with the partially right exclamation: boy does feudalism suck Im glad that it is over.... And true some of the scenarios such weaker films of Mizoguchi present would be literary impossible today. Also his women characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic self-sacrifice which also simplifies the scenario less appealing. Saying that Crucified Lovers is a good film with such few relative weaknesses though the sometimes chilly cynical prose by Ueda the screenwriter helps this film allot. I still highly prefer and recommend Mizoguchis realistic contemprary films of 1936: Osaka Elegy and Sisters of the Gion as well as his late masterpieces in which he showed more restraint and subtlety: Ugetsu Sansho Dayu and The Life of Oharu.',pos

I know an African American who looks like this Trivette guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude.<br /><br />Chuck Norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets I think this show started great but lost steam as time went on<br /><br />They should have dumped Chucks side kick',neg
'This movie is so bad its worth seeing. This movie will have viewers lapsing in and out of a coma within the first 10 minutes. It all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of a jetliner being hijacked and a passenger who can fly a small plane has to land the beast. However they know its been done before many times so to make it different lets do it very badly! Major Masters has his name pirated from 80s movie To Live and Die in L.A. from character played by Willem Dafoe. That saved 10 minutes in writing and production time. The plane is supposed to be a Boieng 747. That plane has a unique silhouette even in the dark with its characteristic forward hump on the top. Just ask the late Ronald Reagan who lamented this point when them Ruskies shot down KAL 007 in the eighties. Yet when the plane takes off its clearly not a 747 looks more like a 767. This well researched film also forgets to include the engineers seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfy rumble seats. No need for a flight engineer on this complex plane! Heroine is played by perpetually pouting Gloria Lynn Berg. After tying up the hijacker despite several bus-loads of people on this jumbo jet nobody bothers to watch this guy who almost killed all of them. Hes just forced to amuse himself.<br /><br />The crippled plane leaking fuel from all the hijacking shenanigans wont make it back to Hawaii so Masters will try to land at an Air Force base located on an island. Only the runways 300 feet too short! Four army guys with little Bobcats (the kind you rent to take all day moving a load of horse manure to the back of your barn) are gonna clear a 200 foot wide and 300 foot long swath through the jungle in 20 minutes! No need for a bulldozer here! Where can you find guys like this? These guys could make a highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours equipped only with tablespoons a compass and a duck!<br /><br />After that hellish obstacle is fixed Masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away. Hijacker giggles to himself and unsupervised gets free to make more trouble. He is finally subdued in a most retarded manner that I cant tell you. But can YOU say Moby Dick?<br /><br />There are so many retarded scenes in this movie. The wounded captain is parked prone on the bar on the plane while Masters who supposedly can barely fly puts the plane into 60 degree banks and 20000 feet per minute drops. The pilot should be french kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts but doesnt budge an inch. <br /><br />I think that if they had picked different actors to play the parts this moving could have been way better. If we need a pouting heroine in the movie why not pick better known actress Bernadette Peters who seems to be perpetually pouting as well? Besides she can sing and the busty well aging Peters could feature some gratuitous cleavage shots. Now with the singing angle this could be a Hijacking Lets Land the Plane Movie MUSICAL! Cast Luciano Pavarotti as the Pilot. They can sing a duet in the cockpit prior to the hijacking and theres no way that tubby tenor would fly up to the ceiling as Masters works his magic on that big bird. In keeping with the musical theme Masters could then be played by Andrei Bocelli that Peters Can sing with as he lands the plane. Not only is he totally blind but only knows a couple of words of English. Now thats a plot! Think of the edge of your seat conversation between Masters (Bocelli) and the Air Traffic Controller:<br /><br />ATC: Sir please throttle back to 180 flaps set to 25 degrees. maintain 230 heading<br /><br />Bocelli: What?<br /><br />ATC: Sir arm spoilers now confirm brake pressure at 250 psi. Maintain descent at 500 fpm<br /><br />Bocelli: What?<br /><br />The hijacker could have been played by the late great Rodney Dangerfield who can spew a plethora of his one liners as he sits tied up and unguarded: I get no respect. My wife is into group sex. Yeah she screwed me in front of the judge and jury! Get the idea?<br /><br />MISSED OPPORTUNITIES The movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers that are never developed. Woody Allen could have been at the back offering one of his neurotic monologues: She said I was great in bed. I told her I practice myself a lot... Now THIS is a movie!<br /><br />Also according to similar movie Executive Decision where lazy eyed Steven Segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance 747s have massive attics up top. The plane was introduced in 1969 so who knows what has accumulated in almost 40 years up there? My uncle has old clothes a sled magazines and all sorts of stuff in his. WOuldnt it have been cool if Masters opened the trap door and saw a teary eyed Chevy Chase in a womans housecoat watching old Super 8 movies of his childhood? Just a recommendation.<br /><br />So give it a chance and as u lapse in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if I had my hand in it...',neg

A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretentions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (too bad they never made a talkie together) and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin Douglas Fairbanks William S.

'(This has been edited for space)<br /><br />Chan-wook Parks new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie the central character is a vampire the film actually has elements of comedy theology melodrama cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body) romance and few other things as well. Its a film that has almost too much on its mind. The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature in this case Emile Zolas Thérèse Raquin. Its an odd mix that doesnt always gel but none the less has an incredible power. Here it is almost 24 hours since I saw the film at Lincoln Center (with a post film discussion by the director) and I find my cage is increasingly rattled. Its not so much what happens is bothersome its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospect.<br /><br />The plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. Infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood (its not explained) he actually survives. Hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick. Unfortunately all is not well. The priest finds that he needs blood to survive. He also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire and its no not possible for him to go out during the day. Things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family. The priest some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend. From there it all goes sideways.<br /><br />An ever changing film this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was. Its a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else. Its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of ways<br /><br />The film has enough going on that one could and people probably will write books discussing the film.<br /><br />The two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance The vampire part of the tale is brilliant. There is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the affliction that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside. Sitting in the theater last night I found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked. I think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking. Here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. Its contrasted with what happens later it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isnt going to work. Its not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys rather its something else. I personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible. (The sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool) The romance is also wonderfully handled. Sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done but its the other stuff the looks the talk the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special. I love the looks the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected and the mad passion of possible consummation. This is one of the great screen romances of all time. It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love (and lust). If youve ever loved deeply Im guessing youll find some part of your hear on screen I know I did. The statement I just wanted to spend eternity with you has a sad poignancy to it. Its both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion. The tragic romance will break your heart. <br /><br />I wont lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great. Its not as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great (especially the actors who I have unjustly failed to hail as amazing) the whole doesnt always come together. The various genres thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other. Frequently I was wondering where the film was going. I hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly.<br /><br />I liked the film a great deal. I loved the pieces more than the film as a whole. Its been pinging around in my head since I saw it and Im guessing that it will do so for several days more. Like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward. One of the meatiest and most filling films of the year.',pos
'House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim (2005) is the sequel though you really dont need to see the first House of the Dead to get this film. That said the production value is definitely here with great zombie effects and its edited quite nicely with very effective sound design. However that said thats about all thats good here.<br /><br />The story and script are awful . . . theres blatant plot holes everywhere. Its also funny how the soldiers dont mind if they get blood on their faces (unlike in 28 Days Later where blood in any part of the body will infect you). Also realistic how theres little order with the soldiers here unlike the usual US Military discipline.<br /><br />A 4 out of 10.',neg
'This doesnt quite plumb the depths of Creepshow 3 but it comes close. It also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology which is distracting to say the least.<br /><br />It also rather irritating rips off The Twilight Zone (with the bookshop being comparable to Serlings later Night Gallery). Unfortunately the producers & writers forgot that Serling would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment.<br /><br />Framing story: Adam West is... well himself. He doesnt go the Bruce Wayne/Batman campy 60s route but he rarely does. He simply plays the not-particularly-enigmatic Jay (theres an ominous spine-chilling name to compare to the likes of Dr. Terror Eramus and The Cryptkeeper) and makes some mildly awkward/creepy statements.<br /><br />Abernathy: Seen Rod Serlings A Stop in Willoughby? Then youve seen this. The red herring of the nutso wife is introduced to no purpose but even the main characters friend identifies him as a wimp. As well directed as can be expected but basically incoherent.<br /><br />Nexs Diner: Reminiscent of various Serling time travel stories mixed with Steve Allens A Meeting of Minds. Most of the actors arent too bad (except for Josh Astin as Cassius who manages to walk talk and even breathe awkwardly) and the idea is mildly interesting. But like Abernathy it doesnt go anywhere. The main character raises some relatively reasonable questions bugs out a bit (who wouldnt?) and for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear wasteland.<br /><br />Life Replay: Not a bad little piece and manages to predate both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls. The main character is mildly sympathetic. Nothing substantially innovative here but its okay.<br /><br />Fighting Spirit: You see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character it has some heart and its a decent story of defeat and redemption.<br /><br />Finale: So... why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits? Dont know. And doesnt make sense. So... all the protagonists wandered into the bookstore and became trapped? Kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks guys!) and the guy in the first segment died. So how did he get trapped? Did he visit the bookstore before he died got trapped and... didnt die? What? Huh? I supposer this isnt expected to make sense because its supernatural. But still...<br /><br />Overall: basically not dissimilar from the two newer Twilight Zone series or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time. But theres nothing really spectacular here.',neg
'I watched this film because I thought it would be a classic Amy Adams movie. Wow this movie is so bad on so many levels it staggers the imagination. It is poorly constructed for one also the script and the acting is just awful. But hey even Johnny Depp has a slew of bad films under his belt. The upside of this movie would be Amy singing and even on that score I believe better songs could have been chosen. Amy is of course beautiful to see and if you are a die-hard fan of hers you will probably watch this title no matter what just dont expect too much. I wish I could have found more to like but it was just painful to watch. I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or Doubt.',neg
'Im feeling a little protective of this film because it was my introduction to the U.N.C.L.E.-verse. The year was 1972 and I.T.V. ran all eight features in one bumper run ( followed by re-runs of The Persuaders starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore ) on Saturday evenings. The Karate Killers was chosen to open the season. It commenced with a cool action sequence as Solo and Kuryakins sports car got attacked by a squadron of THRUSH mini-copters. I was a fan for life from that moment on.<br /><br />After the main credits ( nice to see a special title sequence here instead of the usual practice of slowing down action footage ) we go to the laboratory of Dr.Simon True ( Jim Boles ) inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater. Trues wife Amanda ( Joan Crawford ) has been having an affair with THRUSH agent Randolph ( Herbert Lom ). A ruthless fellow indeed he kills both the doctor and his wife before hunting for the formula. True has prepared for the event - he has divided it into five segments each written on a photograph of himself and sent it to his five daughters all of whom are scattered throughout the world.<br /><br />Solo and Kuryakin set out to get the formula first leading to a string of episodes in different locations and cameos from the likes of Telly Savalas ( as a tight-fisted Italian Count ) Terry-Thomas and Curt Jurgens. One of Dr.Trues daughters - Sandy ( Kim Darby ) - accompanies the U.N.C.L.E. boys on their global quest.<br /><br />Having assembled the formula THRUSH turns up and makes them hand it over before whisking them off to their secret base at the North Pole...<br /><br />Of all the U.N.C.L.E. feature films this is the one I feel should have been produced specially for the cinema. It hurts by being a television product albeit even one more slightly expensive than usual. No location filming was done and the various segments come across as repetitive usually culminating in a scrap between U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH. Of the cast Joan Crawford is memorably hammy in her small role and Curt Jurgens badly miscast as a sugar daddy. As a London bobby Terry-Thomas is as delightful as ever and Herbert Lom good as the chief villain. Kim Darby grates though as Sandy. She should have been told to stay at home.<br /><br />What is surprising about this is that it manages to be more amusing and entertaining than many official cinema releases of the time including In Like Flint Casino Royale and The Ambushers. Id love to know how Solo and company escaped from THRUSH H.Q. after Randolphs death though.',pos
'Wagons East is widely known as John Candys last movie as he died on the set. Thats just what makes it so sad: not simply that Candy suffered a fatal heart attack but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie. Seriously I dont know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap but the flick has NO redeeming qualities. Its as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it. No wonder John Candy didnt want to make the movie; maybe his contractual participation was what did him in.<br /><br />Anyway the point is that Candy did much better than this throughout his career. To be certain he had already completed Michael Moores Canadian Bacon in which the United States declares war on Canada. Just stick with that one and you can say that Candy ended his career honorably. As for Richard Lewis - who previous had co-starred with Candy in Eugene Levys absurd but hilarious Once Upon a Crime - he made up for this piece of crap by frequently guest appearing on Countdown with Keith Olbermann in later years.',neg
'The Hills Eyes II one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest. Or worst however you choose to look at it. While 2006s Hills remake was one of the years best and truly frightening horror films this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment. Part 2 never gets off the ground and neither does its mind numbing dialogue. Worst of all its not that scary.<br /><br />2006s remake followed a family who find themselves in the middle of the New Mexico desert deserted and one by one being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill people. People who as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land years ago have become who they are. Surviving off travelers who wander into the region. The sequel puts audiences in the same desert now occupied by the military as they covertly investigate the hills and what might have happened to that poor family. When a group of military trainees are brought to the campsite they find it deserted with no signs of life. A grim reality soon befalls them as they come to the realization that theyre not alone. And the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destiny.<br /><br />It doesnt take a genius to realize that Hills has no legitimate reason to exist. But because last years remake was received well both at the box office and by critics it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while theres still money to be earned. Theres no rhyme or reason to it this time around just an unbelievable and ridiculous set-up to pave the way for thoughtless characters unoriginal killings a non-existent story and slipping interest. Originally director Alexander Aja made Cravens cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience. One that gruesomely crossed the line on more than one occasions. Its frank display of violence sadistic torture well-rounded characterization and white-knuckled suspense were all effectively used to shock and repulse audiences. The second time around its rehashed hand-me-downs. Theres no style no grit. It tries to build up tension by dismembering bodies when all it really does is make for a been there done that kind film where even the gore seems tame compared to more recent bloodbaths.<br /><br />Its a sad state of affairs when deformed mutants who capture women for breeding purposes fails to keep your attention. Its a bore nothing more. Hills has no bite. Despite a jump or two here and there theres nothing very scary about this by-the-numbers horror flick. It feels like something youd see on the Sci-Fi channel only with some F-bombs a blood splatter here and there a rape and a graphic birth scene thats more gross than shocking. Its cheap. And with Hills you reap what you sew. With no effort given you cant expect anything in return.<br /><br />Replacing Aja with Martin Weisz as director was the films first big mistake all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional resonance. But even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script penned by Wes Craven and his son Jonathan Craven. You ask how bad could it possibly be? This is the kind of dialogue that makes any comparison look like Shakespeare. Craven has had his fair share of clunkers in the past but Id never expect something like this from him. Its so unintentionally funny you have to wonder is Craven playing a joke on this? Or did he dump this one on his son after the studio payed him off? The films characters are one-dimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense. The acting is just as bad. The only character who may win you over is Napoleon Napoli the scrawny kid who doesnt fit in with the others. Even the deranged and instinct-driven villains who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago are met with indifferent. You dont hate them you dont like them. You honestly couldnt care less. Just like this movie.<br /><br />Even if you were giddy with fear during The Hills Have Eyes as I was youll have a tough time finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage. Its as generic as generic gets and theres absolutely nothing here we havent seen done many times already. I cant express this enough avoid The Hills Have Eyes II like the plague. Its frightless unoriginal frantic and a bore. Stick to the remake or Cravens original vision. Because if you dont walk out after the first thirty minutes dont say I didnt warn you.',neg
'One of the best of the Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers films. Great music by Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott Harriet Nelson Lucille Ball Betty Grable Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn.<br /><br />Terrific songs include Let Yourself Go Lets Face the Music and Putting All My Eggs in One Basket. The last song is introduced by Astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings Let Yourself Go with Grable among the backup singers.<br /><br />Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two nice songs and plays Rogers mousy sister. Get Thee Behind Me is a song that sticks with you for days. She also sings But Where Are You? Snappy and fast paced this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the better ones. The classic and amazing beautiful finale Lets Face the Music and Dance is among the best-known of their numbers. Rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history.... a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances (weighted hem) and is also slightly see through. Just gorgeous. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters re-created in Pennies from Heaven.<br /><br />Randolph Scott seems an odd choice as Astaires pal but he also appeared in their Roberta with Irene Dunne. Luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact. Allwyn has the bigger role but is only OK.<br /><br />Rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with Let Yourself Go.... Jazzy and thumping its a great song.<br /><br />Fun all the way although I got tired of We Joined the Navy after the third time....',pos
'This movie is not for everyone. Youre either bright enough to get it or youre not. Fans of sci-fi films who dont take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies. Everyone Ive recommended this film to has enjoyed it. If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks films youll probably enjoy this one. The voice characterizations are done in a tongue-in-cheek manner and the one-liners fly fast and furious.',pos
'Short synopsis <br /><br />This film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men. One of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses. Later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the Christmas holidays. Hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival (during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids so it is really serious). With exposed well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women. One gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion. A last encounter a last light for a cigarette adieu lami farewell friend.<br /><br />I found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters played by classical he-man superstars Alain Delon and Charles Bronson. They are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout. The whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow a little like Deliverance. It is also very stylish. The safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and aluminum tower. It is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around. The wardrobe is also very good. The ultra stylish Citroen DS (maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times) features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placement.<br /><br />I can recommend this movie for the actors performances alone. Delon and Bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting. Both do a considerable amount of acrobatics. I have never seen Bronson better than here he really acts - and speaks French throughout with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed. And it is certainly the man himself we hear. (So the French language version is highly recommended). The police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite Franch character actors Bernard Fresson who was Gene Hackmans partner in French Connection II. He is the best brainy police inspector I know. Also very good is former child actress Brigitte Fossey as the young ingénue who as it turns out is not so Innocent as it first seems.<br /><br />Anyone who expects the old in-an-out of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film. For those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake.',pos
'This is a film about loneliness and how the distance  physical and emotional -- between people tends to stultify relationships.<br /><br />The narrative is simple to the point of banality: a young man Yusuf (Emin Toprak) from a rural village arrives in Istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir); Yusuf wants work in the big city. After trying for a few weeks to find work without any success the strain of having Yusuf living with him is too much for Mahmut. They quarrel  nothing physical just verbal. Eventually Yusuf goes leaving Mahmut alone again. End of story...<br /><br />Except for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film. Much is said visually; dialog is used to bring out disagreement distrust hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two men.<br /><br />There are many visual gems in this film. For example while searching for work young Yusuf needing a relationship tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city. The look on his face as he is thwarted every time says it all.<br /><br />Or wanting a cigarette Yusuf opens the door to the balcony of Mahmuts apartment and lights up in the frigid December air leaving the door open; Mahmut eventually gets up from his work desk walks to the door (all glass) and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time. Then Mahmut closes the door leaving Yusuf out in the cold. The metaphor is complete.<br /><br />Or Mahmut cleaning up after Yusuf grudgingly and with increasing anger; and all the while Yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work and spends Mahmuts money on a toy for a nephew Yusuf is emotional untidy impulsive and vulnerable. Mahmut is rational logical self-confident and a demanding control freak: the right-brain left-brain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look a gesture a frown than any words can convey.<br /><br />But Mahmut is not completely emotionless: he still loves his ex-wife who tells him that shes off to Canada with her husband-to-be. Mahmut affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex and makes sure that she is okay about going. He wishes her well. He says goodbye. He leaves the coffee shop where they were talking. Later when she calls to say a last goodbye on the way to the airport Mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves. The poignancy of the emotion on his face as she disappears through a door is worth the wait.<br /><br />All in all this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director Nuri Ceylan. Some might argue that the pace is too slow; but life goes slowly for much of the time especially for those who are alone. The camera work is relatively simple also: choose the scene set up the camera and lighting and let the actors move across the scene enter the scene and leave the scene all the while keeping the camera still. There were a few panning shots some high-angle tracking shots a few rural scenes  but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens. Except for TV and radio music within the story there is no music sound track. And there are those many long silences as the two men sit and watch TV together and/or engage in very limited conversation.<br /><br />I saw this movie on TV so I was amused to see that on a few occasions I was watching TV as they were watching TV also. The silence in the movie matched the silence in my house (I was awake all others in bed); my chair and position matched that of Mahmuts as he watched TV. Quite eerie giving me a sense of almost being there with him And I guess I was in a sense.<br /><br />Ill say no more because I want you to savor the other scenes that I havent described. Its not a movie for everybody for sure. More than any movie Ive seen it shows just how much we die when we are all alone  just as we are all alone when we die. Mahmuts face as it fades to black in the final scene will stay with me for a long long time...<br /><br />Highly recommended for serious movie buffs.',pos
'Zeppelin is my favorite band so when I heard that this double dvd was coming out I was understandably excited. Ill just cut to the chase here and say that if you are any kind of Zeppelin fan you must run out and buy this right away! Its absolutely spectacular! It blows The Song Remains The Same completely out of the water. Why this material was never released before is beyond me. The footage presented here really shows Zep at the peak of their game which I never really felt that Song quite did. Jimmy Page is the best ever without a doubt and these performances make Jimi Hendrix look like a chump! Be on the lookout for the live jam White Summer... whew!<br /><br />Viva Jimmy Page!<br /><br />Viva Led Zeppelin!<br /><br />11 out of 10',pos
'Last week on Friday I went to see Snakes on a Plane with my friends. It was amazing compared to this horrible film (however many of the scenes were ridiculously hilarious). Basically some woman has a Mayan curse where she pukes up harmless harmless garter snakes that instead of attacking crawl inside of theyre victims. The girl with the bag of coke is pretty hot. On the title screen it says 100 Passengers... 3000 Venemous Vipers! Scary I know. There werent even 100 passengers on the train. Only a couple of stoners and some other washed out losers. Its worth the five bucks to see the woman turn into a huge CG snake and devour the whole train then get sucked into a huge vortex though. Its just sad that someone would go to such lengths to make a crap film only to make a few bucks because of the Snakes on a Plane craze.',neg
'Avoid this one unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie. Example?

Or how about the woman in her underwear holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed?<br /><br />Someone should do a Whats Up Tiger Lily on this bomb.

Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but this is NOT a Taxi reunion.<br /><br />Danny Glover is actually good and even seems to be very human in his emotions as well as showing some real acting talent for a change a pleasant change.<br /><br />Watch at least once - it is worth the effort to catch it.',pos

I wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists but I fear it doesnt. As for the rest of the cst well Id say they simply didnt act very well; although the blame should be put on the poor script.This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2 where Zhang Ziyi dies in absurd way since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie. I could give this movie 2/5',neg
'Is there a book titled How to Make a Movie with Every Man vs. Nature Cliché Imaginable? If not Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects. Ants doesnt have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. The set-up the characters the various sub-plots the death scenes and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases much better. Its amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because theyre all basically the same movie.<br /><br />And can someone please tell me what in Gods name Myrna Loy is doing in this monkey-turd of a movie?

'This stupid anti-environment wannabe Jaws is sad pathetic boring poorly dubbed and stupid. There is nothing redeeming about it.<br /><br />Plot follows some shark/octopus creature-thingy that appears off the coast of Florida and kills some people (including a boring stupid couple with a whiny wife and a silent husband who stabs himself with a fork for some reason). His ascent to the surface is always represented by a vague sideshot of something bumpy over and over. It makes no sense its horribly boring and its conspiracy plot sucks.<br /><br />There are moments of camp that cannot be ignored: the same shot of the boat of the couple of the opening sequence THREE TIMES; the doctor slamming a dying patients chest twenty times with a difibulator without stopping even though hes clearly dead; the porno-esque soundtrack; the shot of the couple making love on the beach with three different thems (That us is getting ahead of us!) doing this; the ancient computer that sounds like Kermit the Frog; a beer-guzzling scientist screaming I know! a la Dr. Smith; the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Oh and everyone drinks at least thirty bears in the course of the movie (much noticed by Mike and the Bots) . . .<br /><br />The MST3K version is their best episode but its certainly better than the movie itself.

'SERIES THREE- BLACKADDER THE THIRD  If you want something done properly kill Baldrick before you start Hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the Prince Regent a vain and stupid foil for Blackadders venom played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw. The format is similar to the previous show after all now they had found the winning formula why change things. We see Blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways trying to make Bladrick an M.P.or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince. In many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times.

'The Last Command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg.It shows us Czarist General Grand Duke Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) in his days of glory.In 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of Imperial Russia he has nothing.He also had the love of a woman Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent).About ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution.His old enemy Lev Andreyev (William Powell) is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not.The Last Command is very good silent drama.Emil Jannings does memorable role work in the lead.Evelyn Brent is wonderful playing the woman lead.William Powell is great as always.There are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie.Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent.And then there is the ending with Powell and Jannings.This is a movie that touches in many parts.',pos
'I had a heck of a good time viewing this picture and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. First off the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets limited settings and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers) barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man) gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancees lustful passions. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However dont be too fooled by its real intent. It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriends head with the perfect body thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.',pos
'Storyline: The film spanning 4-odd hours covers in adequate details the happenings at the Kargil sector near the LOC in 1999 when the Pakistani infiltrators had crossed the LOC and had entered deep into the Indian territory and the Indian Retaliation. To know more about the story I would suggest readers to read the news-items pertaining to Kargil.<br /><br />Comment: If one is looking for a formula story in this movie then one can be sure that it is absent. LOC is a story of Pure sacrifice patriotism courage and lots and lots of bullets and Blood. The movie hall where I saw this film was full of whistles and cheers when the Film shows Indian Bravery. Movie audience seemed similar to Audiences like in an India vs Pak cricket match.<br /><br />Watch the movie as a tribute to the Armys sacrifice and for the characterization of the real-life war heroes (4 PVC honoured heroes) who have sacrificed their lives so that we could see this day. The movie has made a brilliant portrayal of the Army who have battled all odds in rough weather conditions. The films negatives are that it is too stretched and the songs are extremely boring.',neg
'Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies. <br /><br />Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that havent been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog Oh my god and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian Japanese and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but Im still not done with the review.<br /><br />The only reason to see Prom night is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not dont see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only arent they scary but its obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of Oh my gosh. Its our prom. I understand its fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. <br /><br />If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films Id be the first one too. Im not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously dont spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a Night to die for when watching the film.<br /><br />1 star out of 10. (P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would).',neg
'A documentarist like any filmmaker must convey a compelling story. Will Pascoe fails utterly in this effort cobbling together uninspired snippets of Chomskys wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The footage is shot amateurishly and in video. Pascoes only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen: 9-11 Activism Truth.<br /><br />Lame.<br /><br />Compare this with documentaries like The Corporation or The Fog of War which create a narrative drawing material from interviews stock footage and filmed footage. In the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently.<br /><br />The only saving graces of the film are Chomskys nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes.<br /><br />One of the more interesting passages was Chomskys recounting of his experience with National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views while NPRs liberal dogma strait-jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages. Yet another media outlet to be skeptical of.<br /><br />This documentary is for Noam Chomsky completists only.',neg
'Getting lost in space frozen for 15 years thats unlikely. Falling into a star... improbable. Falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes... ludicrous. Getting rescued by a ship just then... priceless.<br /><br />No its not Zaphod Beeblebroxs Heart of Gold to the rescue. Its also not the Parent of the Year awardees. After sentencing her daughter to two years solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man theyve picked up. This foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat which makes up most of the films action. Combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away who obligingly simpers in the line of fire.<br /><br />In the end the family of three abandons the metropolis-sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave instead using the psychos fighter ship which theyve refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 0.7-kiloton missile. You have to love those hard sci-fi statistics! <br /><br />As long as Hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill theyll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the Sci fi channel.',neg
'This TV adaptation of Sarah Waters novel was so lovingly done I can hardly find the words to appreciate it. Not since Tipping the Velvet (also highly recommended) have I seen such a performance by the lead actresses this time by Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. They acted with their souls and this is what gets across to the audience! The supporting actors were well chosen too they made a great ensemble.<br /><br />For those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship - no this is only one part. The other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. And the plot has some further surprising twists. So the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me as well.',pos
'After seeing the movie I feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person although not perfect at all. On the contrary I dont like the author and his two sisters.<br /><br />Is a persons journal an accurate portrait of herself? No. Most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem. So a journal is always a more negative side of a person. In this movie the author judge his mothers life by her journal. Not a wise choice.<br /><br />The authors elder sister is so ugly external and internal. First she said her fathers second marriage is not fair for her mother. Then she said she doesnt love her mother. So she dont love both father and mother. I doubt she love anybody in the world. Her face is so ugly just a reflection of her heart. Through out the movie I feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents. However I feel the father are mother are very loving to their children even the author try to portrait them as cold deceitful person.',neg
'I saw this movie when it was new. Later I rented it in Japan after having been here three years afraid that I would cringe when I viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience. The movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between Japan and Pennsylvania (where Im from). Not all the stuff is factually spot on but the tone is perfect.<br /><br />Im still in Japan many years later and I continue to enjoy this film for its even-handed treatment of the two sides in the story. Interestingly although the Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original the dialog is redubbed in the Japan version to cover up obvious second-language delivery problems.<br /><br />I noticed one reviewer uses this in a Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with Japan by watching this film than by reading any of the serious books on the matter (most of which were written in the 80s and financed by propagandizing Japanese companies).<br /><br />Dont be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who among other things found it implausible that the Japanese would want to build cars in the US. (Of course the Japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction.) This is a very warm and funny movie that I would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clichés like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been funnier.',pos
'I loved this movie. Its a lot of laughs. The acting is good and the writing is really sharp. Id rather see a hundred movies like this than THREE LORD OF THE RINGS repeating and repeating themselves.<br /><br />Its a low budget affair and seems to be shot on DV but looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are great together. Why do you have a ten line minimum? Im not a critic just a patron.<br /><br />I doubt very much that Quentin Tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence. This movie should be seen on more screens than just one. I laughed from beginning to end. >',pos
'I wonder what audiences of the day thought when first laying eyes on Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Certainly he looks like no one else of the time that skull-like face flattened nose and elongated body-- even now he remains an unsettling presence. And what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy New Orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague Blackie is loosing on the city. Im just sorry he didnt have more scenes.<br /><br />The movie itself is very skillfully assembled the morgues black humor the Widmark- Douglas interplay the un-touristy locations the battles among officialsall are woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time. Even Widmarks domestic scenes that put a woman (Bel Geddes) on the marquee manage not to be too disruptive. Director Kazan certainly shows his aptitude for helming a studio (Fox) product no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect.<br /><br />Widmark does a solid low-key job as the public health officer. But my money is on the one- and-only Zero Mostel. Was there ever a sweatier performer who could squeal louder or get pushed around more than the bulky fall guy (e.g. The Enforcer 1950). That scene with Mostel where Palance argues with Mostels shrewish wife (Liswood) is a gem of frantic subservience as Mostel tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball. Too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist. (I wonder if it was the voluble Kazan who named him.)<br /><br />But its not only the professionals that add color. The locals add both character and authenticity especially the two Asian guys interviewed by the cops. That whole scene has an improvised air as if Kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot. Then too that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration. And what about those flea-bitten coffee shops that have me running to the nearest Dennys.<br /><br />Anyway the movie is still a well-staged riveting thriller with an apocalyptic air that oddly foreshadows many of todays mega-hits.',pos
'You can see that if the flick aint directed by his brother this is the best he can do. And sad to say his best just doesnt cut it. Ice Cream Man is a very bizarre horror film thats a real blast to watch if youre in the right mood. In the wrong mood it has been known to cause people to lash out violently at loved ones so please watch with caution.<br /><br />Clint Howard stars (Does anything really star Clint Howard though?) as the evil psychotic bizarre (Yes all in quotes hes not quite any of these but hes getting close) ice cream man who tortures the local children with bomb pops that are really melty and ice cream that has chopped up humans and dogs in them. Ick.<br /><br />Anyway the plots really just an excuse to show of the...well the...um well its a plot. Oh wait I know! Its an excuse to show off all the loser actor cameos! Theres Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (The sequel?) as cops tracking the elusive man o ice cream. And even Doug Lleyweln appears as a supermarket clerk.<br /><br />Even better than that are some of the bizarre goofs in the film. I really like the fact that for some reason instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unhappy fat kid of the group they just make this one kid wearing padding under his clothes. And the entire premise that anyone would by scoops of ice cream from a ice cream man. Who buys ice cream scoops from the ice cream man? Then theres the entire psychiatric ward scene in which Jan Michael Vincents acting ranges from mildly interested to bored beyond the state of consciousness. These are the cops who also scour the Ice Cream Mans place for clues but manage to complete gloss over the ice cream truck (where of course the various bodies and such are kept). Oh well better luck next time troops.<br /><br />Howard himself overacts like hes making sure people two towns over can see and hear him. Its all just plain dumb. And fairly fun to laugh at in the fine tradition of The Pumaman or Gymkata. Youll have a GOOD laugh with the right sense of HUMOR. I love that one.<br /><br />',neg
'Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. Fox which paid Judge to make it has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. I guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. Well I am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. Basically Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin. Then these stupid are getting more stupid by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex which produces more stupid people. By 2500 a person of average intelligence today will appear to be a genius that talks all faggy. Seriously is this really that hard to believe. Oh sure this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one-liners like can we family style her and hey man Im bating here! This is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure comfort and stupidity and I guarantee you that I will be buying this on DVD the first day it comes out and watching it over and over.',pos
'Alicia Silverstone (pre-Clueless) plays a modern-day crime-obsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal slaying of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick which isnt especially well-made but is however surprisingly serious-minded in regards to its leading character. Silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here despite the pictures kitschy undermining. The supporting cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) isnt bad though the violence in the last act goes overboard. Not a cheesy camp-fest but nothing exceptionally memorable either. *1/2 from ****',neg
'Why did I go to see this film? Honestly because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter so do you really blame me for expecting that again? Additionally the premise the funny trailer his co-star Jennifer Anistons involvement and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me.<br /><br />However as my one line Summary suggests I was Disappointed. For various reasons;<br /><br />Reason 1: It wasnt funny. In a 2hour movie I laughed for about 5-10minutes...all together the rest of the time I sat thinking I really should have got some ice-cream. I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films but what does he really expect when he makes Gems such as The Truman Show  Liar Liar  Me Myself and Irene  Dumb and Dumber  The Mask and the Ace Ventura films then produces in Bruce Nolans own words such a mediocre film?<br /><br />Reason 2: Jennifer Anistons role was criminally underwritten. I mean hello! Shes been around in the public eye for about ten years now and in this film she gets about four lines to say. Wrong.<br /><br />Reason 3: One word - Cliché<br /><br />Reason 4: A casual deployment of specifically American References - Jimmy Hoffa Walter Cronkite sweeps week - is a clue to the films specifically home-grown appeal. A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an Education - thats a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle! God tells Bruce a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the US but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety. Additionally I still go to school and that statement suggests me and all of my friends are miracles...or maybe it just means we have brains?<br /><br />In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards.',neg
'As soon as I began to see posters and hear talk about this movie I was immediately excited. The Matrix was an incredible to behold and I couldnt wait to see the second one especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies. However when I saw it I left the theater extremely disappointed as did many other movie-goers at the theater with me. While the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always there simply were too few of them. In the first movie there was constant fighting going on it seemed but the second took a much more (and much unfortunate) preachy point of view. To sum up the plot there wasnt much to it that wasnt expected. The machines were digging toward Zion with intent of destroying it (thats not a spoiler everyone saw it in the commercials). The dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous. Unless youre a psychology major you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie and because of that simply wont care. It became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith for as bad-ass as he was in the first movie seemed to get all religious and preachy. Personally I dont need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it. The movie was a serious waste of my time and I dont think I can watch the first one anymore. The dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me nearer the edge and the ending of the movie shoved me right off. What movie ends with To Be Concluded? How original is that folks. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come up with that one. In conclusion the movie was bad and thats the end of it.',neg
'If youve ever been harassed on the Underground by a Christian who says Jesus is the answer. Whats the question? then perhaps you should thank God if youve never met a Lacanian. Slavoj Zizek the most evangelical of Lacanians would surely exchange the word Jesus in that statement for Lacan/Hegel.<br /><br />Zizeks star burns brightly at the moment no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption. So it seems impressive when someone - anyone - comes along and says Hang on films may say something about ourselves.<br /><br />The ideas Zizek expounds in this film are true purely because he says so. For example Zizek explains that three Marx Bros are the ego superego and id (God knows what happened to Zeppo or Gummo  perhaps theyre the sinthome...or is that movies themselves?). This is simply what they are. In Zizeks output culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology. People may object that he certainly has something to say - but how different is what he says from the Christian attributing everything to Gods will?<br /><br />Whats wrong with taking examples from films or anywhere to illustrate theory? Well nothing at all. As Zizek seems to believe they may even serve as a proof. However it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context. Without context you can say and prove anything you want. For Zizek Lacan is the answer  so he goes and makes an example of it. Everything but everything resembles the teachings of the Master and culture is there to bear this out to serve this ideology. For instance Zizeks exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in Vertigo when Jimmy Stewart spies on Kim Novak in a flower shop. But in the context of the film this is not a voyeurs fantasy position at all. Stewart has been deliberately led there by Novak. This presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout Zizeks two hour and a half cinematic sermon.<br /><br />His analysis of the baby wants to f--- scene in Blue Velvet is laughable. Touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific (to the masculine) truth of feminine jouissance Zizek says that Isabella Rossilinis character not only demands her degradation but is unconsciously in charge of the situation. This is an example of her jouissance. Well ... possibly. But - sorry to be prosaic - where is the evidence for this? In the film she partially undergoes her humiliations because Hopper has kidnapped her son. Zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with Kyle MacLachalan. But this may be due to any number of things. Isnt that the point of so-called feminine jouissance? According to Lacan feminine jouissance unlike phallic jouissance cannot be articulated it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language. If this is right then no example can be made of it. It also means that the entire concept is non-sensical and entirely mystical. It can only be designated by dogmatists such as Zizek: Theres feminine jouissance for you! Why is this feminine jouissance? Because I say so. <br /><br />What example can really be garnered from these films? Only Zizeks psychology. Why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films even to the point that when in a boat on Botega Bay he says he wants to f--- Rod Steiger too? Is this not the wish-fulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films? As the saying goes Freud would have a field day with The Perverts Guide to the Cinema - but with Zizek himself nobody else.<br /><br />Zizeks theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws. This film illustrates how Zizek desires and only extremely vaguely - as to be almost useless - how the rest of us desire. For as any psychoanalyst knows how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated - and cannot be easily universalised if at all. Zizeks love of making everything an example of Lacans Answer bears this out: how do we desire? like this this is how I do it. Problem is in Zizeks desire everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire. But Zizek is a Leninist and they certainly dont like letting the subject speak for itself.<br /><br />The Perverts Guide to the Cinema is a summation Zizeks love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political (what dogma isnt?). Zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis what he is trying to discover because the terms of his exploration and therefore his ethics in doing so are never put into question.<br /><br />Zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing. Hes a kind of Henry Ford of cultural theory: mass-production and any colour as long as its black. He is perfect for todays highly consumerist society: supposedly critical while giving people the same c-ap over and over and pretending that it is something different. This is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems - which capitalism always claims to provide - rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all. Which is kind of like being brain dead. For me Zizeks third Matrix pill is a suicide capsule.<br /><br />PS: I loved Zizeks solemn remark - presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity - that music in films can greatly affect peoples sympathies. Did this only occur to Zizek after he watched Jaws?',neg
'LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake -- wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And hes the star? I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE. In fact I did know better. But in a moment of absolute weakness I rented this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV you know its one of two things: an indie or a dog. As in sat-on-a-shelf. Which this did. And with good reason. The plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la MAGNUM FORCE and journalist Timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them. He is targeted for his efforts -- or maybe I should say for his horrible acting. I turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. Just awful. The real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard looking like nothing so much as a hobo. You just know the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly slumming.',neg
'People I Know is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about -- despite the game efforts of a talented cast.<br /><br />Pacino delivers his usual tour de force as Eli Wurman a past-his-prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption. But unlike Michael Corleone its impossible to have an emotional investment in this character his dilemma or his fate.<br /><br />The film traces Elis preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause while distracted by a clients (Ryan ONeal good in an underwritten part) latest dirty laundry -- in this case a TV actress companion whos gotten involved with the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role although again the script doesnt give her much to work with. As Elis sister-in-law Kim Basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics.<br /><br />This movie is strictly for those who like watching Pacino strut his stuff and enjoy the other principals. Unfortunately between the script and direction People I Know is strictly amateurish. Hence its limited theatrical release and speedy journey to DVD. Consider yourself warned.',neg
'I saw the movie with two grown children. Although it was not as clever as Shrek I thought it was rather good. In a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break there was not a sound so I know the children all liked it. There parents also seemed engaged. The death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments. Hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids. As such it was successful although I liked it too. Personally I liked the Scrat!!',pos
'So many people loved this movie yet there are a few of us IMDb reviewers who found Mirrormask excruciatingly uncomfortable to watch and arse-clenchingly boring. I fall into the latter of these two camps and I will try to explain what it was that made my toenails curl so unpleasantly.<br /><br />Firstly to set the record straight - I like Neil Gaimans books. I sometimes find his knowing sarcastic wry asides humour a little geeky and I actually prefer his work when he is playing it straight and leaving the jokes alone - but even with his occasional lapses into crap dad gags I find his creativity and imagination to be something a bit special.<br /><br />Interestingly one of Gaimans strongest works is Coraline a Gothic fairy story for kids that is very low on jokes and high on tension and creepiness. His latest novel (Anansi Boys) overdoes the funnies and tends to read at times like Terry Pratchett does the Sisters of Mercy (not the nuns but the band). Mirrormask inhabits similar territory to Coraline and when I saw the stunning visuals in the trailer I got a bit excited that somebody had managed to transfer Gaimans spectacular vision and imagination to the screen.<br /><br />In praise of the film some sequences do look stunning. However the visual effects are occasionally ruined by CGI animation that looks like a Media Studies student project. Backgrounds and scenery are often incredible but some of the character animation looks clumsy amateur and cheap. In an early dream sequence the spider is animated beautifully but the book-eating cat-beast looks poorly rendered and very computer generated. Compared with the standard of animation found in productions such as The Corpse Bride Mirrormask occasionally looks very amateur indeed. However in Mirrormasks defence the budget was tiny for such a grand vision and a few creaks in the effects can be understood and forgiven.<br /><br />What cannot be forgiven is the stilted stagy cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. The actors struggle desperately with the dialogue - and there is so much of it that they are constantly hampered and stumbling over it. Conversation is rendered completely unnatural the jokes fall flat time and time again and the turgid speeches appear to be the writers only method of plot exposition. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which always adds an element of Phantom Menace) - this renders the film almost unwatchable. In such an unreal setting the actors need to work twice as hard to be believed and in the main they fail terribly. The girl who plays the lead role puts in a valiant struggle against the impossible stage-school dialogue and occasionally shows real promise but it is never enough. The god-awful cod-Oirish of the Valentine character (with whom she is forced to spend an inordinate amount of screen time) puts paid to any chance of this young actress rising above the material. It appears to be Valentines job to explain the plot to younger viewers and to add a bit of light relief. Personally I wouldnt want him anywhere near my 15 year old daughter.<br /><br />What else is wrong with this film? Answer....Rob Brydon. Whats annoying (for us Brits anyway) is we know Rob Brydon can act! Weve seen him hold the screen for half-an-hour on his own (doing those Marion & Geoff monologues) and in the first real world bit of the film he is fine. However stick him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and turns into the worst am-dram-ham Ive seen in years. A real shame.<br /><br />What else is wrong? Answer... the wanky slap-bassing sub-Courtney Pine saxing and unlistenable too-high-in-the-mix soundtrack that never shuts up. God the music is incessant loud distracting irrelevant and if that isnt enough has wanky slap bass wanking all over it. It makes the dialogue very hard to hear but that could be a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />What else is wrong with it? Answer.... The whistling mime artist. In modern society there should be no place for mime apart from certain secret places in France. Every moment the camera lingers on the gurning whistling moss-juggling yogurt-weaving idiot I understand why the Edinburgh locals get a bit anxious and fractious when Festival time comes round again.<br /><br />My final criticism is that the film is pretty dull. Surrealism often is dull  it either requires its audience to slip into a dreamlike Zen accepting state or for the audience be constantly wowed by bigger and grander surprises. A story with a bit of pace involving characters that we could believe in and care about would have gone a long way to giving this film the emotional centre that it sadly lacked whilst stopping the eyelids from drooping.<br /><br />Finally apologies to all those who found depth meaning and wonder in this film. You have managed to suspend your disbelief you have seen past the creaky CGI ignored the crappy dialogue and the abysmal performances that resulted and understood the makers grand imaginative vision. I wanted to but I couldnt see past the real-world failings that dragged it down.<br /><br />I hope Neil Gaiman gets it right next time if he gets (or even wants) the opportunity.',neg
'Its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by Walt Disney in the 1940s but its true. Here another clumsy attempt sputters confuses and alienates would be viewers with admirable effectiveness while successfully antagonizing those of us who have actually read the story. Irvings original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge. One can either completely rewrite the story a la Tim Burton which is a discussion for another time or pad the bust-line of the old girl with unintended detail. The latter is what is attempted here and if I may say pitifully so. Unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facets to character personalities such as religious zealotry in Crane or wanderlust in good old Bram Bones ruin the storys intent and betray a severe lack of talent by the filmmakers. By the time the tales famous climax approached I had completely lost interest. Its the kind of film where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background.',neg
'I understand that Paramount wanted to film this with the Rodgers and Hart score but couldnt work out the copyright problems so Burke and Van Heusen who wrote the between them the most songs for Bing Crosby contributed a very nice score.<br /><br />I read Leonard Maltin saying that this movie fit Crosby like a glove and I couldnt have put it better. No its not Mark Twains satire its a Bing Crosby film and in 1949 Crosby was the most bankable star in Hollywood. For once Paramount used technicolor and Rhonda Fleming was never lovelier on the screen. This was a woman that technicolor was invented for.<br /><br />William Bendixs Brooklyn origins kinda stand out but its to a good comic effect. The trio of Crosby Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a rollicking good time with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his patented upbeat philosophical numbers with If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon.<br /><br />The third song he sings Once and For Always by himself and with Rhonda Fleming. That song was nominated for best song but lost to Baby Its Cold Outside. <br /><br />Nice also that Bing managed to record the score for Decca with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwicke.<br /><br />One thing I like about this film is that it shows Crosbys comic talents without Bob Hope. I like the Road pictures but Bing was a comic talent onto himself and this film better demonstrates than any other.<br /><br />This is Crosby at the top of his game.',pos

'Having been a Godzilla fan for many years Gamera was to me a cheap knockoff to capitalize on the success of Tohos #1 kaiju star. ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS was for me at the time (1975) an almost painful viewing experience.<br /><br />Last weekend I attended the annual Godzilla fest known as G-FEST where Carl Craig one of the stars of GAMERA vs. VIRAS made an appearance. Of course they featured this movie. It was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made. Of course you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it. In one scene for example the boy scouts held prisoner on board the alien space craft manage to escape by distracting the not-too-bright aliens. When they realize theyve been duped one of them says Thats funny...I think those kids lied to us. Not even PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE can boast that kind of dialog.<br /><br />This may not be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3 but this one is a decent enough time waster if you watch it in the right frame of mind.<br /><br />However if you want top quality kaiju entertainment check out the recently released GAMERA 3.<br /><br />Rating: **1/2 out of *****',neg
'Yep you read that right kids. Michael Bay shouldve studied this film before making either of his over hyped overlong overly pointless Transformers movies. Robot Jox is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the Transformers crew spent on Megan Foxs personal trainer.<br /><br />Thankfully this little robotic gem initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted Charles and Albert Bands Empire Pictures studio seems to have developed a cult following over the years. I fondly remember watching it on VHS during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the Cold War-era politics/stereotypes were already out of date by that time (just the Bands luck that Communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released eh?) its still a pretty damn cool little B-Movie. They really dont makeem like this anymore or if they do they go the Bay route and CGI things to unbearable proportions.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar heres the Robo-scoop: Were somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust large scale wars have been outlawed. Disputes between nations are now settled mano-a-mano (or perhaps that should be machine-o-machine-o) by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized Shogun Warrior style robots. Whichever bot walks away from the fight wins for his side. Gary Graham (who would later go on to play Detective Sykes in the Alien Nation TV series) plays Achilles the greatest Robot Jock in Marketplace (a.k.a. the good guys) history. Achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine Robot bouts (ten being the maximum number of battles before a Jock is retired) and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the Confederation (i.e. The Russkies!) the psychotic Alexander (who is the most over the top evil Russian stereotype bad guy since Dolph Lundgrens infamous turn as Ivan Drago in Rocky IV). The match is called a draw when Alexander violates the rules with an illegal Robot Move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing Achilles but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain. A rematch is scheduled to complete the bout but Achilles simply wants to bow out hang up his helmet and move on with his life. Rather than violate the Spoiler Rules by revealing much more I will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns behind the scenes skullduggery and other difficulties for Achilles and his fellow Jox before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale.<br /><br />I hope Im not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction because it isnt. Robot Jox is just plain fun. Ill grant that it is a bit higher-concept than your average B-grade sci-fi movie and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known (especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green-screen trickery) it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the Empire/Full Moon Pictures factory. The robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion/model techniques and the sets and costumes dont look half-assed in the slightest. Empire Pictures and director Stuart (Re-Animator) Gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture. Unfortunately it didnt quite pan out for them (or the studio) but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal. Bottom line: if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2+ hours feel free to rent a Transformers movie. By the end youre likely to feel like youve spent all that time watching someone else play a video game. If you want to have a rockem sockem robot good time pick up Robot Jox instead.',pos
'Now really can u call that a movie. I knew some of the movies that Japanese people do are good for nothing but this bad? I mean comom i fell a sleep three times at this movie. No horror at all some tiny percent (0.2-0.5) comedy. Action lets just admit that it has some but the scenes are poorly filmed the actors are pathetic. None of the actors did a good job in its own role. The were not convincing. The script is also awful. I mean this movie may be great REALLY but for the 60s(in not 100\% sure.) I recommend NOT to see it unless you want to get so bored as i did. I cant quite figure hot this movie got its rating. Its OVER OVER OVER RATED!!!. This is a PERSONAL opinion of course. I don want to offend anyone but who could like this crap? So i hope this helps someone NOT to loose some time enjoying this movie. Nevertheless its your choice!',neg
'The Shining is a weird example of adaptation: it has very little in common with the source novel written by Stephen King yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror masters work. This is due to two factors: Stanley Kubricks masterful direction and Jack Nicholsons chilly acting.<br /><br />Nicholson plays Jack Torrance a writer who accepts to take care of the Overlook Hotel in Canada during the winter period unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place: he claims a nice isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book. Therefore the Overlook becomes the new home of the Torrance family: Jack his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their five-year old son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The boy in particular senses right from the beginning that somethings wrong: he has been told by the cook Dick O Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy the titular Shining which allows people like him and Dick to see flashes from the past and the future among other things. Because of this gift the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in Danny even though he is quite capable of resisting them. That is not Jacks case however as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wifes affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break.<br /><br />The Shining works as a horror movie because Kubrick though having never worked on this kind of film before knew exactly what was effective and what wasnt hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths. King criticized the director for changing most of the story omitting most of the Jack/Danny subplot (merely hinted at in the film) that led to the books emotionally strong climax and while his disappointment is valid the omission was actually necessary: the novel dealt with redemption albeit in an unconventional way and redemption is a theme Kubrick one of the most famous analysts of human decay never had a soft spot for. What he is interested in is the mental and subsequently physical unbalance that threatens the characters and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot (Dannys encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example).<br /><br />Another criticism King raised was about the actors especially Nicholson: in the writers opinion his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate Jack already was insane thus undermining the rest of the story. Now it is true that Nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning but it is equally true that Martin Sheen (Kings ideal choice for the role) probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as Nicholsons: from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal Heres Johnny! scene it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part and even though the TV version of The Shining from 1997 isnt bad the Torrance character is indelibly linked to the One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest star. As for Duvall and Lloyd both add terrific support the latter especially deserving a place alongside Harvey Stephens (The Omens Damien) and Haley Joel Osment as cinemas great horror child icons. One might complain about Duvall being completely different from the book counterpart (blonde and beautiful) and not having much else to do but scream and run but two things ought to be considered: a) back in 1980 the scream queen cliché wasnt one yet; b) rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from Wendys eyes.<br /><br />Irvine Welsh the author of Trainspotting once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work (and he should know given the liberties Danny Boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen) yet that doesnt mean the movie is necessarily bad. The Shining proves said point to perfection: very little from the novel approximately 5\% is included in the film but in Kubrick and Nichlolsons hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest most original horror pictures of all time which really is saying something given the genres current poor form.',pos
'I had the opportunity to see this film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival in which it won an award for Best Picture. This film is brilliantly done with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble. My favorite performances were from Youssef Kerkour Justin Lane  and Adam Jones. Also there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches that I was surprised to find out that this film was done on a small budget. The writer-director Adam Jones who I believe also won an award for his writing does an excellent job with direction. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie. Definitely a must see.',pos
'More of a Frisbee like turtle with fangs that go up like a wart hog. More battles with people in bird suits that look like people in bird suits. A ping pong ball space ship. Two naughty boys who know how to do everything including getting on board the space ship. More tiresome music. More Gamera is the friend of children stuff. I remember when Godzill and Rodan came out. The movies were a lot of fun because the monsters were actually a threat to people. Now they are just a parade of silly costumes with very little behind them. The adults are all ridiculous and moronic. Like in American sitcoms the kids are the bosses (when in reality they couldnt think their way out of a paper bag). These monster movies must be the Japanese means of partonizing these little snots. Above all however is that after seeing three of these movies (with the same plot over and over; check the stock footage) the ultimate conclusion is that they are boring. If you havent see this one dont bother.',neg
'Based on a Ray Bradbury story; a professional photographer(Brian Kerwin)returns to his modest home near a tiny desert town where most of the citizens wishes he stayed away.

The aliens turn themselves into the images of townspeople. Kerwin must convince evacuation of the town and falls in love with the young boys mother(Elizabeth Pena). Acting is pretty shallow; the story line is no worse than some others; this movie leaves you feeling that you got shorted on a decent ending.

'Roopa (Kamalinee Mukherjee) loses her parents and other family members in a gruesome car accident. She starts living on her own as an independent woman without taking any help from her relatives. She has a boy friend named Rahul (Anuj) and is about to get married to him but backs out due to the behavior of her future mother-in-law and due to lack of confidence shown by her boyfriend. Anand (Raja) joins her neighborhood. And he starts making Roopa feel comfortable and secure. The rest of the story is about why Anand - MD of the richest corporate house of AP - has chosen to reside as neighbor of Roopa and what follows next.<br /><br />This movie has a freshness to it which we rarely see in Indian movies to it. Although the story goes slow you get a sense of familiarity with it. Kudos to the director shekhar kammula for such an awesome direction! Brilliant music and background score composed by K.M. Radhakrishnan adds to the quality. Kamalini mukherjee as Rupa has given a marvelous performance. I think she was the best choice for this role because of her non-glamorous looks and amazing histrionics. Anand as Raja has done well too. I have watched this movie thrice now and enjoyed it thoroughly every time. It is a class apart from the daily dose of action movies we get here. Highly recommended!!',pos

'The trick to creating a good solid mystery story is as much a matter of timing as its about plot contrivances colorful characters or surprising twists. Anyone who has ever labored in frustration with an un-finishable Sunday New York Times crossword knows that any puzzle that takes too long to solve ceases to be any fun. The best murder mysteries be they on film or in print are slight affairs that get to the point spell out their clues line up their suspects and hopefully zap us with a few surprises; being complicated without being unduly confusing. And they play fair; on second third and fourth viewings of the clues and red herrings we should be just as pleased to marvel at how well it all comes together as we were at being surprised in the first place. Indeed good thrillers should get better on repeated viewings as we anticipate the double and triple crosses.<br /><br />Sidney Lumets comedy-thriller DEATHTRAP as derived from Ira Levins hit Broadway play is a great example. It moves along at a tidy clip skillfully juggling its clues being (almost) totally honest with us (even when it is lying to us) and yet never revealing where it is going (even when it is telling us where it might go). It is less a murder mystery movie in the traditional vane than it is a movie about murder mysteries derived from a play about playwriting. Rather than going backward -- a murder and then an investigation to explain why everything happened -- DEATHTRAP leads us through the crime(s) step by step leaving ample room for the unexpected; as the ads advise it is less a whodunit than a wholldoit. <br /><br />DEATHTRAP is often compared (unfavorably oddly enough) to the play and movie versions of SLEUTH though in reality it has much more in common with SCREAM the self-mocking essay on teeny-bopper horror flicks. Like that clever film DEATHTRAP labels itself (a thriller about thrillers) sets it parameters (a one-set five character moneymaker) and then proceeds to deconstruct its genre by revealing itself as the most outlandish and preposterous set of circumstances entertaining enough to persuade an audience to suspend its disbelief. <br /><br />DEATHTRAP bravely gives us a mystery with only five major characters two of which are of minimum importance. Henry Jones as a cagey lawyer is on hand mostly for exposition (and to supply us with his penchant for folksy charm) and Irene Worth is all quirks and comic relief as a psychic-cum-sleuth who acts as the nominal detective. That leaves three main characters to be the killer(s) and/or the victim(s): It is a testament to Michael Caines abilities that as Sidney Bruhl a down-on-his-luck author of mystery plays he creates a character who we intrinsically like and trust even as we recognize immediately that almost everything he says is a lie. As his adoring if somewhat ditzy wife Myra Dyan Canon flirts with being over the top by giving a roller-coaster ride of a performance with a character that by turns seems to be frail or overbearing crafty or hysterical timid or bold and uncompromisingly in love with a less than reciprocating Sidney. The third angle of this unexpected triangle is a fledgling playwright named Clifford Anderson played by Christopher Reeve in such a way that we never quite get a handle on just who his character is: enthusiastic preppie wannabe writer semi-innocent victim or cunningly charming sociopath. As the various character dance around each other the cleverly dour script adapted by ace scribe Jay Presson Allen manages to be consistently amusing even as it builds suspense. And even after the final twist (an improvement over the plays finale) it may not be quite clear just who has manipulated who to do what.<br /><br />Lumet is by no means a master of comedy so he lets his able cast have free reign to flesh out the characters and they all give sharp theatrical yet subtle work with Reeve being particularly noteworthy. But what Lumet does so well is to work skillfully in tight quarters. As he did brilliantly in 12 ANGRY MEN he takes a one-set play and with a minimum of opening up manages to make what could have been cramped stagy and stagnant seem endlessly photogenic and spacious. The setting a country home converted from an old windmill is relatively small but as designed by Tony Walton it manages to be both cozy and charming as well as spooky and treacherous. It is so truly difficult to tell where the studio set and the real country house cross boundaries that to a degree the set becomes a sixth character. And as the scene of the crime it is a most inviting deathtrap indeed.',pos
'You have to figure that when the stars name is listed wrong in the opening credits you are not in for a good time (the credit reads Cuba Gooding J.R.). Some nice car chase shoot em up blow em up action if ALL you want is action because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best and completely unbelievable. The motivations of the characters especially that of Goodings at the end are worse then unbelievable they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled. All I can think is that Andy Cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project (he cant have something on all of them can he?).',neg

'Dieter Bohlen Germanys notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like Youre my heart youre my soul felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer. The result was a funny book about his life. Well more or less a fuzzy image of it. He didnt deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself. No word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital. However it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the German version of American Idol - especially his unforgettable comments.<br /><br />This should be the end of the story - really. In the hype of the mentioned Idol TV show called Deutschland sucht den Superstar (abbreviated DSDS) somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book. The result is Dieter - der Film<br /><br />I have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely. None of the gags really hits the point. Naddels voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although Veronas voice should have done that more. Obvious childish predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes. The content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on Bohlens sloppy idealized memory. They could have used this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be a satire but they failed. The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all.<br /><br />Its no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release. The probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of DSDS turned out to be a mediocre success. With the friendly help of Germanys biggest yellow press newspaper BILD and the desperate situation for the TV station RTL to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show Wetten dass... ? is running on Channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television - unfortunately.<br /><br />Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at.<br /><br />Therefore: 2/10',neg

'Good (not great) little horror film with a high creep factor (not to be confused with a 1991 movie by the same name or the more recent (2001) Campfire STORIES). Central tale of stranded teens telling ghost stories around a campfire in spooky woods nicely leads into and ties together the different stories that make up the bulk of the movie (Watch for Ron Livingston (Office Space Band of Brothers) and Jennifer MacDonald in a spirited sexy segment (The Honeymoon)). Solid acting and a few truly scary moments make this an above-average chiller. Good example of interesting story line coupled with quality ensemble acting resulting in a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Surprise ending of the main story adds nice creepy twist although some may see it coming. Movie is not available on DVD but can be found on VHS.',pos
'...dislike this movie and everyone would understand why. The plot is poor so is the acting. But in my opinion it is better than Halloween 5 although even this does not give many surprising moments. A few scenes are really well directed. But these few moments do not deliver the reason to rent it. I do not despise violence in movies but H6 features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes which do not fit to the tradition of the Halloween-Movies. The most sucking aspect about H6 is the lack of tension. No comparison to the first masterpiece.<br /><br />Halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you want rent it. But dont expect a great horror-experience....<br /><br />',pos
'Following the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) Walt Disney Productions has continued to produce quality animated feature-length childrens film many of which I still havent had the pleasure of seeing. The AristoCats (1970) directed by Wolfgang Reitherman was the twentieth film in Disneys official canon and is a romantic musical comedy revolving around a family of aristocratic cats living in Paris France in 1910. In the mansion of the elderly Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (voiced by Hermione Baddeley) her loving feline pets  including Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens  are the most important residents. When the bumbling butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) learns that the cats stand to inherit the old ladys entire fortune he sets about disposing of the pets dumping them in the countryside far from the big city. Lost and confused Duchess and her children strike up an acquaintance with a sweet-talking alley cat Thomas OMalley (Phil Harris) who agrees to show them the way home.<br /><br />Animation-wise The AristoCats isnt anything particularly notable with much earlier Disney films such as Snow White and Fantasia (1940) demonstrating a similar or even superior visual style. However the story is interesting and exciting  particularly for younger audiences Ill wager  and the musical numbers {which I wish were more numerous} are terrific. For the sake of trivia Ill name my two favourite songs as Thomas OMalley Cat and Evrybody Wants to Be a Cat the latter of which is a psychedelic throwback to the late 60s with a swinging jazz band and delirious flashing colours led by a trendy feline called the Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers). The familys journey back to Paris is eventful and adventurous and we meet such friendly characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble {two talkative geese} Uncle Waldo {the pairs drunken relative} Georges Hautecourt {Madam Bonfamilles ancient but sprightly lawyer} and Napoleon and Lafayette {two dim-witted hound dogs with a hunger for the butlers rump}.',pos

'This sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb. Nazis occult  government conspiracies. I was expecting a low budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like from David Lynch. That was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is just awful.<br /><br />Part of the trouble is the casting. Andrienne Barbeaus character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid. She just doesnt do that well even at her age though she certainly tried. The actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy. Most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky. The only one that I thought did really well was the daughter Siri Baruc.<br /><br />Another big part is the pacing. It starts off very slowly. So slowly you might be tempted to turn it off. But then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters suicide and the aftermath. But shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess. Some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focused.<br /><br />The real problem is its simply not a pleasant movie to watch. Its slow dull none of the characters are likable. Overuse of imagery and sets. Some movies you see characters get tortured. In this its the viewer that does. It does have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy Nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome.',neg

'Ironically what makes John Carpenters The Thing such an entertaining sci-fi film are its genre-defying elements of mystery suspense and tight plot structure. It puts to shame such films as Aliens or Armageddon that are content to inundate the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics testosterone-laden one-liners heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer Iraq and pathetic attempts to inject meaning into the barrage on screen with emotional sequences that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience. The supreme tragedy of course is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular. I think that there is a cause for this although it isnt very comforting. There is an increasing trend in our culture to passively surrender to the media -- to immerse oneself in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to comprehending the statement the work is trying to make. This mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once-hallowed print medium is being diluted thanks to the abominable reader response theory that pervades our schools and the tabloid brigade that lines our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be infiltrating the once-venerable mainstream press. Nowadays we just flip the switch and put our minds on pause. Is The Thing a good movie? For the rare individual who still values his faculty of reason a more appropriate term would be entertaining. Its plot keeps one guessing its ending is uncompromising and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia. Upon subsequent viewings one begins to note a conspicuous lack of depth in the acting but the taut storyline remains compelling. Of course Citizen Kane its not but then again sci-fi never was a thinking-mans genre...',pos
'Now Ive seen it all. Just when I thought it couldnt get any more pathetic and cheesy than Woodchipper Massacre just when I thought dialogue and acting couldnt get worse than Nail Gun Massacre just when I thought Dont Go In The Woods would retain its title as Lousiest Slasher Film Ever along comes THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY! Somehow this cheap wretched manure manages to avoid lewdness but it remains terrible! I couldnt believe my eyes--for once I cant complain about excessive (or in this case any) nudity in a slasher film but it still managed to make me crimson with embarrassment for renting it. Never before have I seen such horrible acting dialect direction writing....I could go on forever with this list! Heres a quick run-down:<br /><br />A mental patient somehow escapes from the loony bin dresses up like a surgeon somehow finds out where his doctor lives and breaks in while the doctors daughter is having friends over for the night. Then begins the most stupid killing spree (ripped off from other movies such as Slumber Party Massacre and Halloween) this side of the universe. The characters have negative IQs which suggests they are not human. Then again I guess they are not since they have the tendency to bleed Kool-Aid when they get cut as the slasher likes to show use when he holds up his scapel to the camera in WAY too many scenes. It is only 80 minutes...how many times must we look at that scapel like that before it consumes the whole movie?...which I suppose wouldnt be all that bad of an idea in this case! There is one moment where I thought maybe just maybe the director would make it interesting (a second killer was added) but alas! It was not to be! And then to insult even further there is a stupid super cop-out sub-ending and an even stupider final conclusion. That probably doesnt make a whole lot of sense but I would hate to give away the dumbest few scenes in movie history to those two or three fools (like me) dumb enough to rent this sewage.<br /><br />I sure hope that by writing this I have saved 80 minutes of someones life.

The only real victims in this rattlebrained asinine nonsense are the poor morons that have sat through the whole toilet tank!

'Great little thriller. I was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what I got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time. Mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed. o such foolishness here. Yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals. Such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled. We saw them so we could just how efficient the Lisa character was and how inefficient the new Hotel clerk was. We see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose. THe Flight Atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead. The bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight. The rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too. The only 2 characters that were just 5 liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane. THat was clever because I thought they would have something to do with plot. From the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named Lisa is in charge. Even when Jackson shows his true colors she doesnt panic. She thinks what she can do to stall time. Any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots. But not this one. It was a very short movie and I was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast. Thankfuly none of them were used. The new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her. Was Craven should do more of these types of movies. Also one last comment. Brian Cox is in the movie but I had not one clue who he was. I had to come over here to see that he is Lisas father. He is completely unrecognizable.',pos
'I completely forgot that Id seen this within a couple of days which is pretty revealing in itself. The umpteenth version of Gaston Phantom of the Opera Lerouxs locked-door country-house mystery I had heard that it was an engaging and witty update. So it appeared from the likable title sequence and a few neat touches in the opening scene but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely tedious and wholly unsatisfying.<br /><br />As a mystery the major problem is that it is fundamentally unsolvable by the audience: like the worst Agatha Christies it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a wealth of background information that we have not been privy to. As a film be it comedy or thriller the crucial problem is that characterisation is almost non-existent. With the exception of the killer everyone is a face-value version of the typical suspects in the typical country-house murder story - reporter endangered heiress suspicious fiancé scatterbrained scientist father (a surprisingly poor Michel Lonsdale) etc. Theres no depth and little of interest and the frequently over-ripe or misjudged performances dont help. You frankly dont care about anyone in it so theres no jeopardy or suspense. Only Claude Rich and in the last reel Pierre Arditi get anything to work with and only in the last reel does the film get close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effective.<br /><br />For the rest we get endless exposition and a couple of ineffective would-be comic set pieces (a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought through to pay off) with Dennis Podalydes reduced to Irving the Explainer for the last third of the picture. Im not fond of country-house movies or Agatha Christie style whodunits so those who are might cit it a lot more slack but I found it a poor show. As Rich says when the mystery is revealed Its all rather something of a disappointment.',neg
'Shawn Michaels vs. Edge-8- Kind of hard to believe Shawn Michaels is in the opening match but still a great match by both men Edge whether you like or not is a great performer in the ring and Shawn Michaels is just ageless when it comes to his performance The Undertaker vs. Heidenreich. Casket Match-2- OK after a good opening match now this what a crappy match. Undertaker has given some great matches at the Royal Rumble and 1998s Royal Rumble against Shawn Michaels was the same type of match but this is way worse then that match.<br /><br />Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. Bradshaw. Triple Threat WWE Championship-6- Its alright i feel all three men could of given a better performance this just really didnt show them at their best.<br /><br />Randy Orton vs. Triple H. World Heavyweight Championship-9- Triple H gets a clean win can you believe it sure he takes out the Sledgehammer but doesnt use it. Randy Orton did great when acting like he got a concussion but how he got the concussion is really ridiculous. I really liked this match this was the best performance ive seen from HHH in forever.<br /><br />The Royal Rumble Match-7- This was highly entertaining and i usually dont score the royal rumble match this high. The winner is again very predictable but just this had a lot of moments that were very entertaining to watch The segments with Flair and Guerrero are hilarious the best segments ive seen in a while.<br /><br />Overall this is a great PPV and a must own for wrestling fans.',pos
'On the whole one wishes this was a better film but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth while. Peck made this film during the same period that he made The Gunfighter before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor. A pity! He was a fine actor perfectly willing to tackle characters that were not very likable and to do them extremely well. The character he plays here is driven and when necessary ruthless. Given the mission the character has been assigned and the men with which to do it those characteristics are essential.<br /><br />Without being a spoiler think of this film as an early grittier example of The Dirty Dozen genre. <br /><br />The dialog in this film is a bit ham handed but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling. It contains good work by all the character actors and even Barbara Payton turns in a credible performance.<br /><br />This one isnt often shown on television so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy. Go ahead! Devote an evening to it. It is worth your time!',pos
'The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal fairs in My Giant is to say that this movie is to his career as Ishtar was to Warren Beatys - it didnt ruin it but it slowed it down.......a lot. Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play opposite a kid 2) never play opposite an animal 3) never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you is as innocent as a kid and acts like an animal.<br /><br />What is this story? A comedy? I guess but I didnt laugh except at the scenes where Crystal is on his own and not burdened with his (what-is-her-role-in-this-movie) ex-wife or the afore-mentioned Giant. Did I mention theres also a kid in this film? Well forget about him. The son is brought in to make us feel sorry for Crystal and we do but for the actor not the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you dont believe me watch him in old episodes of Soap or Saturday Night Live. Go rent City Slicker or Running Scared or When Harry Met Sally.<br /><br />Giant is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum.<br /><br />',neg
'This movie had no parts that were hilarious mostly just average funny units but it did not have any parts that were really bad either. The worst part was the voice of Sid. His slothy slur was just too much for me. By about 5 minutes in I was sick of hearing him talk. Aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good. There were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better. This is a good movie for kids. It has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids. This one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.',pos
'I have to confess right off that I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. Indeed from me he gets no respect. I watched this only because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without any real humour. Its full of lame crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developers (Dangerfield) plans to build a ski resort in Utah that just didnt capture my attention at all.<br /><br />In addition to Dangerfield the film starred a weak cast including the likes of Andrew Dice Clay and the totally over the hill John Byner (I didnt even know he was still around until I saw his name in the credits for this.)<br /><br />This truly is a Dangerfield disaster.<br /><br />2/10',neg
'Ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from? According to Jake Speed they are based on real people living out the adventures they write about and publish. This movie is quality family entertainment moderate amounts of violence and skimpy clothes at the worst. The language is is also not a problem and the jokes are funny at all levels. This is a Austin Powers look at Indian Jones without the over-the-top antics of Michael Myers. I highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range.',pos
'Oh for crying out loud this has got to be the LAMEST movie Ive seen all year and Im sorry the normally awesome John Cusack was even involved in this brainless twitty piece of Stupidity. Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message albeit on a more subtle somewhat more mature level Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so (and thats an hour and a half of my life Ill never get back again thank you very much!!). Its bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen-year-olds (actually Ive known better fourteen-year-olds...) except maybe for Jeremy Piven who was enjoyable enough. Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsales character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind (literally) had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief. I told my husband Rockstar had more intelligence and at least the characters in Rockstar werent half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this Serendipitous mess. Its annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives and feel theyre nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate. How utterly tiresome. Im sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those whod rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences. After all heres a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other peoples lives (namely their respective fiancées) not to mention other relatives and friends just to get there.<br /><br />',neg
'This movie has everything going for it: Fully developed characters a realistic portrayal of working Washington bathed in warmth and humor that is uniquely Albert Brooks. The dumbing down of network news is even more of an issue now than it was in 1987. Remember this was pre-cable! So satisfying to care about complex people attempting to achieve complex goals -- and it all moves along with lightning speed. Such a true to life depiction of friendships that teeter toward romance. See if you can spot John Cusack as the angry messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hackes from real life Broadcast News? Finally if youre from DC see if you agree with Holly Hunters directions to cab drivers!',pos
'I used to watch this on either HBO or Showtime or Cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90s that my parents subscribed to those channels. I came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark bizarre and fascinating. I was young then in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great Arliss Howard and being blown away by Big Bad Love I bought the DVD of Wilder Napalm and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years. I absolutely loved it! I was really impressed and affected by it. There are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads their story the music and all the other actors as well. Its truly Cinematic. I love Arliss Howards subtle intensity ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence Im a big fan of anything he does; and his interplay with Debra Wingers manic glee (they are of course married) has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera. (I wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries?.......Big Bad Love should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it; its brilliant.) And Dennis Quaid in full clown make-up sneakily introduced angled hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you dont see very often. Quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways with that huge slit mouth span hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness (here as both). Both Howard and Quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion. In fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity. Its really a fantastic film put together by intelligence imagination agility and chemistry by all parties involved. I really cannot imagine how this got funded and it looks pretty expensive to me by such a conventional imagination-less system but I thank God films like this slip through the system every once in awhile. In a great way with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors hip intelligence darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: Grosse Pointe Blank.......now thats a compliment in my book!',pos
'Though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES this is a weaker escapade in both a plot thats less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesnt have the charisma of Ray Milland.<br /><br />That said several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying. Also John Barrymore is present popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises.<br /><br />Anyway its another endless night for BD as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry. The clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining.',neg
'Plan B is strictly by-the-numbers fare except for one thing. I surprisingly found it to be rather insulting.<br /><br />Jon Cryer is the star of this film and plays his usual smarmy egotistical snotty character that was actually endearing in Pretty In Pink and has NOT been amusing ever since. Grating doesnt even begin to describe his performance. Ricky (Mark Matheisen) is a muscular blonde struggling actor who (gasp!) is only worried about his hair and getting laid. Talk about a stock character...ugh. At least the other three characters are somewhat engaging. Lisa Darr and Lance Guest play a grounded optimistic caring couple who are struggling to conceive. Since they are not whiny drama queens however their roles are apparently considered boring and they arent given enough screen time. Sara Mornell rounds out the cast by playing Gina your usual nice and good-looking young woman who just cant seem to find the right partner in love. Ive seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situation.<br /><br />What startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes. They introduced a Russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked. He was portrayed as being wild ignorant and amazingly shallow. They were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays. Gina decides to be gay for a while since she isnt having any luck with guys. Honestly. That wasnt that bad except they really went overboard when Gina brought a lesbian to a Christmas party her friends were throwing. Her lesbian date had very short hair (like Im sure all lesbians do). She also got quite upset (like Im sure all lesbians do) when Gina had the nerve to put on lipstick(!). Finally her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when Gina expresses her disappointment. Of course we all know how gay people cant stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years right? (Please note the sarcasm in that statement. Thank you.)<br /><br />This film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but Cryers unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema. 2/10',neg

'Trust me this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge Denzel Washington fan. The frustrating part is that its 1/3 of a GREAT film. The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl hes paid to protect. The trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped. So Im giving nothing away when I say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after shes kidnapped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous. Rapid frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story. Im sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in Creasys character and signified that a different movie was to follow. Well he was right. The movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap. The result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie.',neg

Never expect a decent film if its written directed and produced by the same person and never EVER expect anything of value from Jeff Fahey.',neg
'Rawhide was a wonderful TV western series. Focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss Gil Favor. Most episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons were really character studies of Favor and his men. Guest stars came and went but unlike Wagon Train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in. Rawhide was a true gritty western and Gil Favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten. Thanks to Eric Flemings performance the show became a massive hit. Of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - Clint Eastwood Sheb Wooley Paul Brinegar Steve Raines James Murdoch Rocky Shahan Robert Cabal. All of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history. Rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no other series has for me as yet anyhow managed to do so. Later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines. For me some of the time this didnt work - the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories. However there were still some classic stories and Rawhide remained top drawer affair. The black and white photography added to a bleak realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture. Rustlers IndiansCommancheroes beautiful damsels in distress serial killers they all showed up to give our heroes problems. The end came for the series quietly when the final season was axed less than half way through. The reason - Eric Fleming had departed and Rawhide was now a head without a body - the gritty realism was gone Gil Favor commanded respect and exuded authority - he was never infallible and this made him all the more interesting. We shall not see his like again. Watch an episode whenever you can they seldom disappoint.',pos
'I enjoyed the film very much especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful Gong Li as the concubine.<br /><br />It was a little distracting however to have Chinese dialogue PLUS English subtitles PLUS American-accented voice-over even though the voice over was very well synchronised.<br /><br />Qin shi huiang dis (The First Emperor of Qins)family name was Zheng and his given name Yiong so in the English he should have been referred to as King Zheng or Emperor Zheng and NOT as King Ying Zheng as in those days the two family/given names were not used together.<br /><br />The State of Qin is pronounced Chin not shin - a pity the researchers didnt get this right.<br /><br />I forgave this but was dismayed at the end when the commentary announced that he was buried at Zai-an together with his terra cotta warriors.

'The essential message - one which Miller would have surely intended after seeing Vichy war crimes trials - is that hatred of somebody without rational basis is a waste of life. Meat Loafs character Fred has known Lawrence for many years and yet when the time comes at the bidding of his fanatical supporters he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their target group. For me this is the crucial message - it doesnt matter what Lawrence and his wife do from this point onwards - they are marked and have chance to save themselves by using reason. Animal aggression and anger have blinded Freds Union thugs to reality.<br /><br />A friend of mine suggested I should see The Wave to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them realising it. I once conducted an experiment in a role-playing game and was shocked to see how normal and level-headed people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state - which would ultimate threaten them all - because it crept in in stages.<br /><br />Fred is the start his LA friends and preacher idol are the catalyst which pushes his neighbours over the edge into violence without stopping to think that what they are doing in wrong.<br /><br />The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein the Jewish shopkeeper is a fascinating one because Lawrence misses the point almost until the end: if the bigots force Finkelstein out where is he to go? If his family have fled the Nazis what an irony to be tormented again in the land of freedom.<br /><br />That big poster (its a fairly famous propaganda piece) about American families enjoying the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail. When you see this film watch for the grafitti on the subway train and all the little posters. The message lurks there too.<br /><br />This movie should be on the curriculum of every school especially in our time when baseless hatred is being promoted so widely by reasonable people who are just extremists in thin disguises.',pos

'Fully deserving its prestigious Hollywood award nomination this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some delightful surprises.

'The good thing about this thats at least fresh: Almost no movies about dance music and the club scene (if even made) hit the cinemas. And it radiates lots of energy too from the music to the portrayal of Ibiza.<br /><br />But the main problem is that it cant decide what it wants to be. Although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of This is Spinal Tap the makers also realized they wouldnt want to play copycat. However it fails grossly on the jokes because its not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped. And it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes so why not edit it down to 75? The production department and cinematography still try to save the day (e.g. Pauls home).<br /><br />In a strange way and unexpectedly so Its all gone Pete Tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of Almost Famous. Especially the scenes with Beatriz Batarda offer some acting power.<br /><br />Conclusion: its a mess it somewhat entertains at a basic level but you better spend a night in your favorite club.',neg
'To paraphrase Thora Birch: I kind of like this movie. Its the exact opposite of everything I hate in a film.<br /><br />This obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign. And a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens - where instead the focus is on character development has a limited target audience. Whoever heard of a mature teen movie?<br /><br />But if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the DVD you could do a lot worse. My Teachers Wife is nothing revolutionary but it has a lot going for it and holds up well to repeated viewings.<br /><br />Jason London (as high school senior Todd Boomer) is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in The Man In the Moon and Dazed and Confused. He is helped out by exceptional work from his supporting cast. Tia Carrere in the title role is a revelation (she can act) as Todds calculus tutor and love interest. Christopher McDonald as the teacher in a nice self-parodying performance. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as Todds best friends and Jeffrey Tabor as his father. <br /><br />As someone commented earlier this is a mature teen movie because the romantic relationships are universally unsuccessful-at least by traditional happy ending standards. Even Todds parents are indifferent to each other with his father panting after the title character and his mother (Leslie Lyles) literally on the telephone during her entire time on screen (a device that provides increasing comedy relief with each successive appearance). The London-Carrere romance has unexpected charm and is far more believable than any other older woman storyline you are likely to find. <br /><br />But the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of the three friends. There is no overwrought melodrama here just three immature people who alternate between testing and trusting each other subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing. They actually manage to pull off a believable three-person relationship perhaps the first one in cinema history. <br /><br />Then again what do I know? Im only a child.',pos
'Ridiculous nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly superficially and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés about Tuscany and Italy divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. Im sure the book was bad but it cant have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow Tuscan lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasnt Tuscan enough?) which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. Youve never seen the white marble of Romes Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever and therefore quite worth a look.',neg
'Ive had a lot of experience with women in Russia and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like unfortunately. They are very cunning ruthless and greedy as well as highly unfair. From the robotic sex the hustling for gifts to the lies and betrayal Ive experienced it all in Russia.<br /><br />I know what Im talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here are the photojournals of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride.

The Russian woman that Nicole Kidman plays is a lot like the Julia and Katya in my photojournals.<br /><br />My 3 bride seeking trips in Russia happen to be very exciting and would sell so why dont they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in Russia? However there is one factual impossibility in this film and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport. It doesnt work that way at all so I dont understand why the media likes to perpetuate this. There isnt a single Russian bride introduction website that works this way and I challenge anyone to find one that does. The fact is you can only order the Russian ladys CONTACT INFO (email address phone number etc.) from the website. From there you correspond and then visit her and if you want to bring her to your country you start the immigration process at your INS office and wait months after that. Thats how it works in real life. You cant just order her to arrive at your airport.

'The 1963 version of The Haunting has been one of my favorite horror films for years so I anticipated the release of this 1999 remake with a good deal of trepidation. It hardly seemed that any follow-up could exceed or even equal the original masterpiece. Unfortunately my worries were well-founded: This movie stinks.<br /><br />I dont know what the people involved in this film were thinking. Jan De Bont who seemed to have had a fluke when he directed the excellent Speed does as poorly here (or perhaps even worse) as he did with the much-hyped duds Twister and Speed 2: Cruise Control. Hey Jan stick to cinematography would ya? Liam Neeson is adequate in his role as the doctor-pretending-to-be-a-sleep-psychologist -- I dont think he is capable of turning in a truly bad performance -- but even he cannot save a lame script and weak story. Catherine Zeta Jones proves once again (as she did in Entrapment) that she lacks the acting ability to rise above the material that is handed to her. The female lead who did great in an episode of The X-Files looks lost here as Eleanor an insomniac hovering on the edge of sanity. And that blond guy whoever he is is more wooden than the laughably strange statuettes of children carved into the woodwork around the house. I dont think he changes expression once during the entire film.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br /><br />The reason the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure whether the house was truly haunted or whether the manifestations were a result of Eleanors precarious mental state. No spirits are actually seen in the original leaving much up to the imagination--a hallmark of other great horror films like The Changeling and The Blair Witch Project. In this updated version we of course get tons of CGI ghosts which basically (in the face of the weak script/plot) make the movie totally unscary. The f/x arent even that great considering they were done by ILM. The frozen breath looks particularly fake. The effects in the underrated Peter Jackson film The Frighteners which I saw just before this one were a lot better. The wooden carvings of the children which are supposed to look creepy just look silly (especially when they scream) and the CGI monsters are nothing to write home about. Rather than providing a relief from the bad acting bad direction and bad writing the effects only add to this mess of a film.<br /><br />Some particularly dumb scenes: When the three other characters break into Eleanors bedroom and none of them seem at all surprised to find a huge scowling demon hovering over the bed. The scene where Eleanor sees the former lady of the house hanging from the rafters... the acting here is particularly bad. And last but not least the unintentionally hilarious bit where Wooden Blond Guy utters an uninspired shout of what is supposed to be anguish leaps up on a piece of furniture and starts slashing away at the painting of the old evil guy who built the house. We actually get some satisfaction in this scene as seconds after his attack Blond Guy is dragged over to the fireplace by the ghost of the old guy and promptly gets his head cut off by the flue. It was the only part of the movie I enjoyed.<br /><br />In sum stick to the original 1963 The Haunting. 3/10 stars.',neg
'For the first couple of seasons I thought The Apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show. The combination between reality TV and a 16 week job-interview was innovative and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too out there.<br /><br />The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all. In the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show (that means lying trash-talking backstabbing etc.). The boardroom can be entertaining to watch but its entertainment at its low-point - Sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old Jerry Springer episode. The tasks on the show are at most boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay NBC for the publicity. And what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6? That is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real-life. <br /><br />I have absolutely NO respect for any of the contestants this season they all seem like idiots to me. In earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show. It also seems like Donald Trumps massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest I cant see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom mostly doesnt make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what its worth.<br /><br />R.I.P The Apprentice. Please NBC for Gods sake get the show off the air as soon as possible. Its just too embarrassing to watch. The Apprentice was once a great TV-show but now its just a big fat joke.',neg
'This game is an action/adventure with combat. There are quite long periods with no combat but other times you have to get rid of various kinds of monsters. The monsters are not like anything you would see in real life and they have to be gotten rid off in order to continue with your quest. The whole game is a quest. You play Adam Randall whose father contacts him from the beyond and asks him to come and save him. The game is from the mid 1990s and has to be played in DOS. I used Dosbox and was able to play the game quite well. The graphics are not as good as some games even of the time mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look quite blocky but others look batter but dont let that put you off the game. The game is very imaginative its long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere. Not for young kids who likely wouldnt be interested anyway but over 13 or 14 might like this game. Its a horrormysteryctiondventurecombat combination.I thought it was a great game. Its had to find now. maybe Ebay. But remember its a DOS game and you would not be able to play it on todays faster computers. would be hard to play on fast computers unless you use Dosbox.

'Theres nothing new here. All the standard romantic-comedy scenes even down to the taxi sprinting to the airport to stop the woman flying away.

'With a cheap pound shop having just openedi thought that it was worth looking to see if their were any cheap DVDs that looked good.and while the back of the cover made this sound like a Jeepers Creepers type of filmit is actually an anthology film! and thought one or two of the stories feel very familiar.Its still a fun light horror/comedy. The plots:<br /><br />Story one:The classic.<br /><br />A young couple feel the it is time that they should try to in prove their financial life by picking up a $1500 car.Butwhen the guy goes to pick a cara car starts to talk to him.The car (called Banns) says that to get everything that he has ever wanted in lifethat he must buy Baans for $5000.So while the guys relationship crumblesBaans does everything he can to show who really is in charge.<br /><br />Story two:Kitchen culture.<br /><br />A guy that might get thrown out by his land lorddue to how messy his flat isdiscovers that due to keeping a tuna pasta in his fridge for six monthsthe it has now moulded and evolved into a green mouldy version of himself!.And while they start off as friendsthey end up having a big falling outthe leads to a final battle to see if the real guy or his fridge clone will survive.<br /><br />Story three:Too good to be true.<br /><br />A girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets matched with a guy the is perfect for her.But she is unsure that the guy is too perfectand when she thinks that she sees him shut down she starts to get spooked. View on the film:<br /><br />The first thing that i have to mention is the rating for the film in englandwhere it has been given an eighteen ratingeven thought it has no nudityswearing or blood at all.And the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endingswhere the goodies win!.And while the first story is too close to the Stephen King classic Christinethe second story is easily the highlight of the filmwith director Tom Parkinson making the nuttiness of the story feel like a low-budget Muppets episode!.<br /><br />Final view on the film<br /><br />While it does have a bit of a remake; feeltheir is enough wackiness to make this a good horror comedy.',neg
'This really is a film of two halves. The first detailing the lives and friendship of two boys (one a privileged Pashtun and the other a down-trodden Hazara) in late 70s Afghanistan before the invasion by the USSR works extremely well. The young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing Afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark relief.<br /><br />The real problem comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the Pashtun as a man living in America. Ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things break down. The central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic but in fact comes across as wimpish and wallowing in self pity. It is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see - that of his boyhood friend.<br /><br />Once he returns to Afghanistan the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly contrived coincidences. Most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately (even though he is not looking for him) despite the chaos that has since consumed the country. This enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible. The resolution of the narrative is also run through with an awful mawkish sentimentality which undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to make.<br /><br />Although it is possible to start seeing characters and the abuses of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which engages with any wider political discussion. Instead the narrative becomes reduced to one characters emotional journey of self discovery and healing. Unfortunately this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story while opportunities to make a really interesting film about Afghanistan itself are wasted.',neg
'> Contrary to most reviews Ive read I didnt feel this followed any of the other rock movies (Spinal Tap etc.) The story was more unique although I feel most people wanted to see the sex drugs & rock and roll vices that the band kept alluding to.<br /><br />> As an American I knew a few of the actors - Spall Connelly & Rea. Surprised to find out Brian/Bruce Robinson was in Zifferedis (<sp?) classic Romeo & Juliet.

Whoever wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably fired but for whatever reasons possible this movie greatly lacks in excitement! That doesnt mean it has no action but look on the dark side of the picture.

'Hardbodies 2 is harmless aimless and plot less. I would add brainless to that list but the movie-within-a-movie gimmick although not done very well helps it to narrowly escape that label. The scenery has changed from the California beaches to the Greek islands and the only returning cast members from the first film are Sorrells Pickard (the bearded guy) and Roberta Collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit bringing back memories of her classic catfight with Pam Grier in The Big Doll House). All the other actors are new but apparently Brad Zutaut is supposed to be playing the same character (Scotty) as Grant Cramer did in Hardbodies. This sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie and doesnt come close to matching it in the hotness department either. Of course Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are both very pretty but the Teal Roberts - Cindy Silver - Kristi Somers team is unbeatable. Hardbodies 2 is not the worst of its kind by any means but if you only want to see one of these movies the original is the one to get. (*1/2)',neg
'A good film and one Ill watch a number of times. Rich (the previous commenter)is right: there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards and I have to wonder how much has suffered in translation. Were there more in the original? Or was a native-language audience expected to lip-read more? Or -- since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based -- was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? In short very worth a look but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it.<br /><br />The Alpha Video release touts the new organ score but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way. Sure it starts promisingly but degenerates into a repetitive Phillip-Glass-like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen. After listening for a while I turned off the sound and simply watched: much better!',pos
'Being a slasher film aficionado I typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain I will say. While channel surfing the other night Sleepaway Camp II happened to cross paths with me. Of course I wanted to check it out as I had heard of the Sleepaway Camp franchise but have never actually seen any of them (for shame I know). I will note that since I have not seen the original my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously because perhaps what I think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchises own design.<br /><br />Now Im assuming that the franchise of Sleepaway Camp is in itself a joke on itself. Hell even the name comes off as an intentional joke. Sleep away camp? Its good fun. I can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value but thats about as far as I can go. The acting in this movie made the cast of the original Friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of Macbeth. Campy requires bad acting but come on. Pamela Springsteen as the evil out-of-touch-with-reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast. As far as comedy goes there were a few times where I chuckled but it was few and far between.<br /><br />Ultimately SAC II is pretty boring and I really did want to sleep away the camp. The deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them. If youre looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp I recommend Club Dread. If your channel surfing takes you across this one check and see what else is on.',neg
'The 80s is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun. Sometimes there were some definite brains behind it all (Evil Dead II Night of the Creeps and Return of the Living Dead for example) and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends. Movies like Pieces and Blood Diner stacked rental shelves in the 80s and 90s offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment. Kevin Tenneys 1988 movie Night of the Demons is a part of this tradition-stupid poorly acted and not an original bone in its body but dammit if you dont have a good time.<br /><br />The plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80s: a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20s decide to go to a party at Hull House thrown by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Scream Queen legend Linnea Quigley.) Well Angela and co. decide to throw a séance. This turns out to be as Will Arnetts Arrested Development character Gob would call it a Huge Mistake because a demonic force soon possesses Angela and starts to get to the others as well.<br /><br />Take The Evil Dead A Nightmare on Elm Street and your average dumb dead teen flick throw them in a blender and Night of the Demons is what you get. The movie is anything but original and really its not a good movie. The whole thing is insanely derivative the acting is terrible the jokes often fall flat the characters are annoying (especially the character of Stooge) and the plot holes are numerous. That out of the way its still a lot of fun. So why? <br /><br />Well for one thing the make up and gore effects are top notch with some really memorable moments (especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick) that really stick out. It also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously yet with the exception of some terrible puns plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness. Plus theres a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise thats almost impossible to resist. Yeah its nothing special but it knows that and it couldnt be more proud of that fact. Its a goofy party horror movie and it never pretends to be anything more.<br /><br />It might not be a classic but Night of the Demons is a good example of horror junk food done right. It might not be too memorable or original but sometimes you dont want a fancy beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.',pos
'This movie is NOT funny. It just takes the D&D nerd stereotypes and amplifies them. All the main characters make less than 30k a year they all live with their parents theyre all socially retarded and they have no luck with women. The jokes are horrible and unimaginative such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a KKK looking hood on (it was his wizard costume) and the other guy had on a John Rocker warm up (oh how funny hes a nerd so he doesnt know about sports). You may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny. Poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch but obviously extremely cheap to make. I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly DAngelo. I guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime.',neg
'Spectacular Horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it. The atmosphere is very creepy and stylish the score is chilling but the best about the movie is its performances. Its rare to get scared by performances and this movies solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor.<br /><br />The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes. Though the woman in black does not have much screen time she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes. The dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and thats when it becomes really scary. <br /><br />If you have the chance watch this on theater its a totally different experience but as scary as this movie.<br /><br />This is one of the best Ghost movies ever and its directed for people that want to get scared.',pos
'This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that Ive spent in a very very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies youd probably say thats hard to imagine but never-the-less its true! After seeing the trailer for this movie I knew that I had to see it! If youre a fan of horror mystery and suspense why wouldnt you? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately the movie is none of these.<br /><br />From the cinematography to the script to the acting this movie is a complete flop. If youre reading this planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills mystery action horror or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes Im afraid you are in for disappointment.<br /><br />Why is it so bad you might be asking yourself. Let me tell you. The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful. Nothing about the movie made me the least bit on edge frightened or curious. The script was at best laughable. There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasnt. The acting was absolutely dreadful. I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss. Without exception every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique. Finally the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away.<br /><br />I am not usually a very harsh critic. Frankly when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery/suspense/horror I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring poorly acted poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.',neg
'This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max film after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film I felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this. It supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film and was merged with the Mad Max franchise(bad idea). The casting was not exactly the best I mean come on Tina Turner? One of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains. No Wez no Humungus not even a decent Toecutter! Nothing really even happens if you are going to plan on seeing this sub par action flick (can it even be called that?) make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max or better yet both. Another problem with this film is that there are too many people even the Thunderdome battle sequence is dull Max doesnt even kill anyone!

So I watched this movie with my brother and I must say in the beginning it was very promising. Both of us really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene. But i guess that was all. There are some interesting fights but it is not a action movie as it claims to be. Instead its a love movie... with the cliché of love so extremely played over the top even Shakespeare would vomit on this title. Sorry for my language. By the way: The characters act like being picked up from the street and given 100 for playing in this movie.<br /><br />Well I and my brother watched it to the end because we thought it can only become better.

'Like most people I love A Christmas Story. I had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason--it is awful. Same locale same narrator same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking. Charles Grodin was a poor choice to replace Darrin McGavin but I cannot imagine anyone being able to replace him. The story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. The interaction with the neighbors the Bumpuses is ridiculous. In A Christmas Story Ralphies obsession with the BB gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring. Scud Farkus the original neighborhood bully is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the Scud Farkus menacing appeal. It would be pretty difficult to equal the original even if this movie had been made with the original crew.',neg
'This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. Spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in spades. I never felt once in this movie that Spilsbury was anxious for anything. Revenge love justice? Not in this guys portrayal.<br /><br />There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot did not force them to be friends you dont get the impression they want to hang out with each other. Plus the sidekick has the more interesting personality. Ewww.<br /><br />The dialogue is predictable and boring.<br /><br />The narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the Dukes of Hazzard you can picture what this is like. I cannot believe the director would agree to this. It insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line I just witnessed.<br /><br />Hey at least the horses and locations looked good maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director.<br /><br />RATING-2 You may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is.',neg
'The title has many meanings - the boxing ring where differences and grievances are fought out a wedding ring where Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels his troubles will be over and the cause of the trouble a ring-like bracelet that Bill gives Mabel as a love token. <br /><br />Former professional boxer Danish Carl Brisson was given his start in films by Alfred Hitchcock in The Ring. A very young Ian Hunter who went on to have such a long career in movies plays Bob Corby who catches the eye of a pretty girl Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis) at a fun fair. She happens to be engaged to One Round Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) but that doesnt stop her flirting with Bob. Bob is persuaded to go one round with Jack. He goes several rounds and wins - he is a professional boxer and he and his manager have come to the fair to find out if Jack is as good a fighter as they have heard. He offers to take Jack on and Jack goes off along with his boorish trainer (the great Gordon Harker) to make his fortune with plans to marry Mabel when he makes good. Jack wins his fight and marries Mabel the next day but the deep attraction that she and Bob feel for each other is still there. Jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight Bob for his wife.<br /><br />At last a boxing movie where the hero doesnt go off the rails - Bob behaves himself and does everything he can to be a champion - if only Mabel acted in the same way!!! She has left him for Bob - and the fight at the end is a mighty one. It is intensely realistic - it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film. From being raw and enthusiastic Jack is almost knocked out - then between rounds reuniting with Mabel gives him the courage to triumph. The question is why would he even want her back - from the start she thought nothing of starting an affair with Bob - why wouldnt she do it again?<br /><br />The film is loaded with symbolism. Jack shaking hands with the promoter changes to Mabels hands accepting a bracelet from Bob. When Jack puts the ring on Mabels finger Bobs bracelet slips down her arm. At the end Jack sees Mabels reflection in a ringside water bucket and that gives him the confidence to go on. This is an excellent film that will not disappoint you.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.',pos
'i love bad shark movies. i really do. i laugh hysterically at them. and the scifi channel was having a marathon of them culminating in the premier of their new original picture hammerhead: shark frenzy. based on the previews it looked like it was going to be HIGHLY amusing. essentially a remake of benchleys creature really. it was prefaced by a showing of shark attack 3: megalodon which is shark movie hilarity at its best. i was in the mood; i was ready to go. bring it on hammerhead-mad-scientist-man! oh god was that movie wrong.<br /><br />wrong wrong wrong.<br /><br />sick. twisted.

'Dont let the premise fool you--this was one funny movie. The problem--it wasnt supposed to be a comedy. The story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes. Even worse the set-up is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking Is that it? I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role but he had very little to work with. There are odd quirks and interesting turns everywhere which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Let this one come out on video before wasting your money.',neg
'After Garbos introduction to sound in Clarence Browns Anna Christie Jacques Feyder made a German version of the movie where all of the cast except for Garbo were different. While the American version is still more available in the USA and most of the American viewers have primarily seen this version the Germna Anna Christie is more likely to be viewed in Europe. As I have seen both films I feel the right to compare the two closely-knit productions. Is Jacques Feyders film different? Is it better than Clarence Browns? <br /><br />In this analysis I would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common. They have identical sets very similar scripts and the same chronologically presented scenes. Here you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life. Here you also have the humorous though a bit shorter sequence in the amusement park. However when emphasizing Garbo herself I address the first difference. She does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking. The viewer concentrates more on her acting than on the way she speaks which occurred most probably to 1931 viewers. Garbo was very good in American film and she is also very good here. Yet to me she seems even more genuine in the German version. It is noticeable that Garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much (the effort that was artificially created by the sensation: GARBO TALKS!). Her German is not very well pronounced; yet no one cares: everything is perfectly understood. Therefore I can easily say the same I did in my American version comment: Skaal Greta Garbo! <br /><br />Yet the film differs in one very important issue: the rest of the cast. Here comes the question: which portrayal seems more captivating which one is better for sure? The differences are filled with varieties. Salka Viertel (or Salka Steuerman) Garbos lifelong friend does not do the equally great job as Marie Dressler in the role of Marthy Owens. She is not bad she is different sometimes overacts (from todays perspective) but is no longer that genuine in the role as Marie Dressler who still amuses us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time. Some people even claim that Dressler was better than Garbo in the film and that opinion though appears to be questionable of course carries some truth. Theo Shall is more sympathetic as Matt than Charles Bickford but when applied to him this is not the matter of performance so much as the mater of looks.<br /><br />Who shines in the German Anna Christie who is really worth greatest attention is Hans Junkermann in the role of Chris Christopherson Annas father. George F. Marion vs Hans Junkermann is like a day vs night difference. Junkermann portrays a real alcohol addict a man with hopes with fears who overdoes the care of his daughter. The scene of Annas first meeting with her father is truly magnificent the opening moment of Chris conversation with Marthy is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance. Junkermann is the Chris whom you like who you sometimes laugh at whom you sympathize with who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic sailor in your mind. Great! <br /><br />If you have seen the American Anna Christie and have a chance to get the German version I would highly recommend to you this movie because its a slightly different look at the story a nice and accurate way to compare a fine enrichment to Clarence Browns movie and foremost a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance: Hans Junkermanns. Skaal or Prost Hans Junkermann!',pos
'While the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film; it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth.<br /><br />The case is the use of the soundtrack music: a mix of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber that plays constantly and loudly and would have made Max Steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult; how ecstatic; how tortured it is to be an artist. And then it really counts the story elides the details at the end.<br /><br />This heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by Peter Ackroyd about a Yukio Mishima book: This is not writing this is Barbara Cartland.

Even at that age the humor was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence.<br /><br />In the past whenever I would see Ed Begley Jr. or jeff Goldblum I would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad. Until I was reminded of the existence of this movie today I was unsure why I felt that way. Apparently I blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained. Apparently I forgot that I saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen nay EATEN by the creators of this inhuman work.<br /><br />I havent been brave enough to try watching it as an adult. I imagine that as part of the healing process that I should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that I can *truly* put it behind me. Some regression therapy and / or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either.',neg
'Well Cube (1997) Vincenzos first movie was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that Ive ever seen when talking about movies. They had just one scenery a bunch of actors and a plot. So what made it so special were all the effective direction great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth. His second movie Cypher (2002) was all about its story but it wasnt so good as Cube but here are the characters being tested like rats again.<br /><br />Nothing is something very interesting and gets Vincenzo coming back to his Cube days locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room. But instead of a thriller sci-fi (even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that) Nothing is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world were living. Once again Vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing. 2 actors and a blinding white scenario thats all you got most part of time and you dont need more than that. While Cube is a claustrophobic experience and Cypher confusing Nothing is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate.<br /><br />This movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget. Of course that the movie fails sometimes but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws. Theres nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that I had in movies since Cube.',pos
'Some of the films produced by Roger Cormans New World film company in the 1970s represent the best kind of B-movie where the limitations of the genre actually act as a kind of freeing influence on the writers and directors  such classic drive-in films as Deathrace 2000 Hollywood Boulevard Grand Theft Auto and Caged Heat emerged from this environment. Unfortunately his former confederates at American International Pictures were running out of steam in the 1970s particularly in the absence of Jim Nicholson and they often produced second rate imitations of Cormans films sometimes featuring his self-made stars. Black Mama White Mama is one of those films. Its basically a cheaper imitation of The Big Doll House with some of the same stars doing a lot of the same things. Yes this is a John Ashley co-production (yes the same John Ashley who was the hilarious Elvis wanna-be in How to Make a Monster and paired up with Debbie Walley in Beach Blanket Bingo) with all the signature marks of his productions  womens prisons where everyone except maybe 2 or 3 lead characters including the inmates and the guards are Filipino actors in mostly non-speaking roles where we see supermodel-type women taking on the roles of revolutionary militants and where the primary joy of the film is derived through rudimentary S&M exploitation.<br /><br />The print I saw most recently was horribly light-damaged (good ole Will Viharo described it as Yellow Mama Yellow Mama) but I think even in the best conditions the photography and directing are extremely routine. Theres also very little visual value here Corman must not have had very much to do with the film itself because he was always canny enough to at least give his films some extra production value by filming in free public spaces that would make the film look more impressive. This film doesnt look impressive it doesnt have an impressive soundtrack and you just feel embarrassed for anyone who shows a shred of talent. The only remotely interesting performances come from Pam Grier as a feisty whore out to escape the life Filipino actor Dindo Fernando as her grotesquely self-indulgent pimp and Sid Haig as a cowboy styled mercenary. The story places Grier and co-star Margaret Markov in a low budget female version of The Defiant Ones but does very little with the melodramatic possibilities afforded by that premise. Its basically just an excuse to ensure that the two protagonists can still stop for a good mud wrestling match while theyre trying to escape the prison together. This is all in the spirit of good fun but the film ultimately fails even as exploitation because theres a certain edge and rawness that should be present in such scenes that is instead replaced under this directors hand with a kind of yawning predictability.<br /><br />So the film will have little value for fans of hard-core exploitation value  at least in the version I saw its no more explicit than Faster Pussycat Kill! Kill! from over a decade earlier and far less interesting visually and thematically. For those who just enjoy getting a laugh out of so bad its good films this one might provide some fun but its not in the upper tier. People would be more advised to seek out Caged Heat or some of the others that revel in their own brutality to the point that it becomes camp; this one is more similar to less ambitious efforts like Cirio Santiagos The Muthers. Sadly the best thing about this particular film is the title and the presence of Pam Grier who was better in other films around the same time (particularly Jack Hills Coffy). This film perhaps illustrates a midway point in Miss Griers journey from Corman secretary to B-movie Queen-For-A-Day but other than its historical significance as such it will have little value even to Griers big fans because she is given very little to work with here.<br /><br />Worth skipping unless of course you get to see it in a movie theater with a lot of friends and a lot of beer like I did. And even then its value is questionable.',neg
'During the 1990s several attempts have been made to revive old Matsumotos series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive old Yamato saga in form of a laughably bad Yamato 2520 which was completely abandoned after mere two episodes. Captain Harlock suffered a confusing and pointless Harlock Saga while Galaxy Express 999 suffered having this hack of a movie stapled to its name.<br /><br />If youve seen Queen Millennia youll recall that it was a wonderful movie in its own way. Maetel Legend tries to tell a sequel to this already concluded chapter also finding a way to suck at doing so.<br /><br />This movie takes all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie mixes it with badly paced melodrama and to add an insult to an injury tosses in some of the most renowned characters from Matsumotos universe.<br /><br />The only redeeming aspect of this movie is good artwork but the remainder is so amazingly bad that it cant save this movie from being a total loss.<br /><br />If youve enjoyed Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express do yourself a favor and skip this hack of a movie.

'Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity. In other words when he could act he didnt have to talk like some street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he became a promoter of the F word also. This might be the kind of society that they actually live in but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company. I dont recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity but it was something like this. It shows a lack of intelligence poor language skills and disrespect for all those that have to listen. Maybe it is time that Al takes some acting courses again to sharpen his talent. Oh yes the movie... Probably the worse thing that McConaughey has played in. Hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people. Rene Russo as always was hot.',neg

'One of the better musical bios. Dennis Morgan is great as the singer/composer Chauncey Olcutt. The supporting cast is very good especially Andrea King as the glamorous Lillian Russell.

Morgan was always underrated as an actor and a singer.',pos

'Enchanted April is a tone poem an impressionist painting a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out. I continue to wait albeit less patiently for the film to come out in DVD format. Apparently I am not alone.<br /><br />If parent company Amazons listings are correct there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The cast is spectacular the cinematography and direction impeccable. The film is a definite keeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.',pos
'I was struck by the awful acting and script for this movie. All the characters seem rendered immobile by personal issues - rather like deer in headlights. They dither around whining and moaning about their emotions when decisive actions need to be taken. I found myself yelling at the TV screen trying to wake them up to their situation and DO SOMETHING! The plot line is implausible. Every time there is a key decision to be taken by a lead character one of the other characters has to bring up all the problems with the obvious decision as though to further render the decision more difficult - it is a tried melodramatic ploy and just wants to make you groan. Clearly the import of the decision is obvious - you dont need to treat the audience as idiots. Overall - there is just too much emotional melodrama in the whole movie.',neg
'Crash is overwrought over-thought and over-baked. A great example of how to make a pompous and self-important film with a message. Haggis tries too hard to make his point and overreaches in just about every category of the film. It feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer to the skull. Sure race relations affect everyone and theres a great deal of ambiguity to the issue but the universe of Crash operates to suggest that we are all victims to our own perceptions on race. Its a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad nauseum and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes. I found the outcomes of the characters unsurprising and forced and the film took forever to sputter out and die. The fact that this film is in the top 50 movies on IMDb is a testament to the publics willingness to get suckered by Hollywood malarkey.<br /><br />Indeed if you want the real Crash go check out the one by David Cronenberg: dark twisted and original. This film plays as preachy tiresome and masochistic.',neg
'I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors. The replacement of RDA in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show.<br /><br />The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous. You get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling. This relationship carries over into the program we get to see.<br /><br />RDA gives his ONeill character believable personality. He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances. Still they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.<br /><br />There is a lot going on between Carter and ONeill under the surface. They manage to keep the lid on but often just barely. The episode Solitudes in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television. The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.<br /><br />Carter and Jackson often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by ONeill. Yet ONeills tactical instincts always seem sound. He understands what to do without having to think about the matter. The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.<br /><br />The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black but that was all. Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons. You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby. She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.<br /><br />The spin-off Stargate Atlantis has a few moments but is mostly a weaker effort. The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. The villains (Wraiths) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it wont last beyond the fourth season.<br /><br />There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in Sci-Fi. The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad. The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept.<br /><br />I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too. In the season 2 opener Daniel Jackson is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded. He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet. The episode Hathor has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the SGC yet it is never mentioned again. This device could have been used in several later episodes on Daniel ONeill and Dr. Frasier.',pos
'Quite the most boring nonsense I have seen in a long time. The plot was full of irrelevance and the acting was the worst I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />To make it worse camera angles that made me feel sick were used  the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue (maybe not a bad thing then) and the shots of San Francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist boards promotional video.<br /><br />Oh and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done. Better lighting next time please.',neg

Following are the plus points of the film...<br /><br />Wonderful direction cinematography and editing the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent.<br /><br />Even though the film shows the life of Mumbai Policemen and their hardships it never gets boring or sympathetic.<br /><br />Mind-blowing acting by lead actor Nana Patekar. One can surely hope that he gets nominated for the Best actor for the academy awards.<br /><br />Controlled violence. The violence is controlled and the film doesnt become a bloody mess.<br /><br />No stupid songs as in usual Indian movies.<br /><br />',pos
'Curse of Monkey Island is a treasure; in my opinion the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure gaming not to mention LucasArts.<br /><br />But to return to Curse whats beautiful about CMI is that its not afraid to be itself. It does deviate from the first two but still remains faithful to the Ron Gilbert productions (if only the same could be said about the 4th installment of the series!). The voice work is impeccable with Dominic Armato playing our favorite protagonist Guybrush Threepwood. The animation while quite different than the classic pixelated characters is done beautifully. It really is just absolutely gorgeous. And the music is fantastic! Its never annoying and you never have the urge to turn it off.<br /><br />Although Im not too big a fan of romance the romantic scenes and themes are not at all overpowering. They also have the rare ability to come off as sweet instead of cheesy. That says a lot from a girl who routinely falls asleep during chick flicks.<br /><br />Then of course is the classic MI element of humor. CMI is quite adept at delivering deadpan lines altogether absurdist humor and simply good fun. Gary Coleman makes a cameo as a budding young entrepreneur and world events are discreetly jabbed at without stepping out of the bounds of the game.<br /><br />Its not entirely fair to compare CMI to MI and MI2 because it truly is in a realm of its own. Personally I can never find a favorite between the 3 as they all are quite different from each other. However if you want a swashbuckling good time with the flair of the classic series I insist you give this game a shot. You will NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />10/10 stars hands down.<br /><br />- Emily N',pos
'This show seemed to be kinda good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I like police series but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong. <br /><br />First of all the writers should have more suspects than one you know who did it EVERY TIME!!!!! That makes it boring. The main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way. I know they wanted her to be tough but shes mean stupid and a bad chief. The crimes are uninteresting and bland and its just lame all the way. As stated above I hate it.... <br /><br />All in all this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed...',neg
'This show is up there with the best Comedys made in Australia as it makes fun of pretty much anything which is what lots of our public want. Some of the best bits in the show are the ad road test which tests out how an ad would do in real life. What is really great about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people(the chasers)who love doing what they do and who would nt. This show has loads of bits in it that can crack up anybody like the ad road test which Ive already mentioned Mr ten Questions where he asks 10 questions really fast in front of famous celebrities like Hugh Jackman and the Beach boys temporary ones like The Chasers Emmys and ones that have been there from the start like What have we learnt from Current affairs this week.

'If youre a long-time fan of the Doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series rest easy -- it more than meets the high expectations of the original. The pacing is much quicker than the original shows fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent the acting superb. The hardest - and best - thing to get used to is the production values of the new series. Compared to the original its got some now. (Although I will always have fond memories of bubble-wrap and hand-puppet monsters.) If youre not a fan or if you tried the original and couldnt get a handle on it jump in with both feet now! Everything you really need to know about the Doctor theyll tell you as they go along. This series was written with minimal references to the Doctors enormous back story specifically to encourage new viewers. Admittedly Im only seeing the first new series now as its being shown on the Sci-Fi channel (in other words probably cut to ribbons for time constraints) but Im looking forward to future episodes either on broadcast TV or on DVD.

'This is a great ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was. I can remember being freaked out by metal teens when I was a kid. It doesnt help that I found a desecrated grave in my hometowns graveyard when I was ten. Turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan. So maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile but I love it now as a 24 year old.<br /><br />I bought this DVD used for 6 bucks and I expected it to suck due to the lame cover but to my surprise it ruled. It is all about the extreme demonic power of metal. And you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd. This movie is awesome if you love 80s metal and bad movies this ones for you. 9/10!',pos
'When I heard Patrick Swayze was finally returning to his acting career with KING SOLOMONS MINES I was very excited. I was expecting a great Indiana Jones type action adventure. What I got was a 4 hour long (with commercials) epic that was very slow. The second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it. The ending was good (no spoilers here)but I was still left wanting more. Well all a guy can do is prey that Swayze does RoadHouse 2 so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous. Until than if your a fan of King Solomons Mines than read the book or watch the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of 4 hours.',pos
'What ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that couldve been directed by anybody available out of film school...and in fact they probably wouldve done a better job. They wouldve at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes. (gasp!) Except this time around the apes squirm through groan-worthy dialogue nonsensical plotting and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money couldve been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered masterpiece next to this tripe.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy the superb acting talent that is Tim Roth his performance as evil ape leader Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing. Luckily for him the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.<br /><br />And alas the always dependable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause. And the haha were so clever arent we? way that Hollywood intermingles references from the original POTA into this one. Sigh...<br /><br />Instead of seeing this spend the night in and call up some friends and rent Ed Wood Edward Scissorhands Batman or even to a lesser extent Sleepy Hollow and reminisce about the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality...not shame and ridicule.',neg
'Scientist working frantically in seclusion finds a way to locate the impact crater of a meteor carrying a new radioactive element. All (pseudo)science and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are right there including the idea that radioactivity could heal any illness if properly harnessed.

'Quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom.<br /><br />A group of top quality actors in the main well cast (with a couple of notable exceptions) who give pretty good performances. Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana. All do well with the scripts they were given.<br /><br />So much for the good. The average would include the sets. Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the Dower House looks remarkably like it. It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big. In the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the UK presumably to save money although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylon.<br /><br />Now to the bad. The screenplay. This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives blinded. He makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why?? Loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmers wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear (less emotional than Brief Encounter). Gus a man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint. Walter (Mudge in the book) turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man. Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who wont speak. Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification. The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers. Whilst Miss Mortimers breasts are utterly delightful I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward. The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing the list.<br /><br />There is a sequel (which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense) and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story. It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased.',neg

Regardless of what you saw on TV you are not fully informed until you watch this movie. I apologize for quoting another reviewer but it needs repeating: Roger Ebert of Siskel & Ebert said Whats interesting is if youre looking for people who are unbalanced zealots... you dont find them among the Branch Davidians you find them among the FBI and the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms; those are the people in this movie who deserve to be feared I think. I think every person responsible for 9/11 needs to be brought to justice but I think the government has not shown a history of honoring its duty to protect peoples rights and this movie proves it in dramatic fashion.',pos
'Jackass Number Two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006 beating the also hilarious Clerks II. It is one of the best sequels in recent memory beating Jackass The Movie in every way. Now this film may be the funniest but it is also the most offensive appalling and utterly disgusting. You will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film. Im completely serious when I say dont eat anything before watching or during this film because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you. Keep the drinking to a minimum as well. Youve been warned because just like the tagline says it will make you beg for mercy.<br /><br />Jackass Number Two follows the crazy men from the hit show Jackass Johnny Knoxville Bam Margera Ryan Dunn Steve-O Chris Party Boy Pontius Preston Lacy Ehren McGhehey Dave England Brandon DiCamillo and Jason Wee Man Acuna (Chris Raab Himself Raab is absent) as they perform the most outrageous life-threatening and revolting stunts imaginable. Im not going to tell what the stunts are but I will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening and that one cast member (once again not telling) will flirt with death several times in the film.<br /><br />What makes Jackass Number Two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them. To put it simple if they loved doing it and had a blast you will too (this goes for 99\% of the stunts). All the stunts are very original and 90\% of them are never-before-seen. You will witness a few recycled ones but theyre amped up. You wouldnt think directing really factors into a movie like this but it does; Jeff Tremaines direction makes the movie so much funnier because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing which is simply brilliant on his part. He could have just sat back and slept throughout filming (actually youll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming) but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could. I give Mr. Tremaine two thumbs up for that. Another great thing about Jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos and this time they include BMX legend Mat Hoffman skateboard god Tony Hawk director/actor Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers & Beerfest) actor Luke Wilson Miami Dolphins star Jason Taylor and director/actor Mike Judge (Office Space). The scenes with Hoffman Taylor and Chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film as its even funnier to see these men as a part of the film.<br /><br />Jackass Number Two is one of the most politically incorrect morally degrading and just plain wrong movies of all time if not the most. Despite this it is so original and so hilarious that you wont care about that. Youll be gasping for air laughing so hard youll be crying and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film. Due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film no one under 18 should watch this film. Youve been warned. I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two as much as I did.<br /><br />10/10 --spy',pos
'I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10.<br /><br />The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughs and gags are classic muppetism.

Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film.

John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters they worked well in shooting the film allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc which makes for a great story. I feel like all of the actors gave excellent performances. I disagree with some of the other comments that say the acting was not good. Watch it and decide for yourself.',pos
'Id heard of the case but hadnt really paid attention during the whole hoopla of Fuhrman writing the book Skakel being arrested etc. However this movie did an excellent job of detailing Martha the Skakel brothers the murder Mark Fuhrmans involvement and the results of his investigation. I especially liked the flashback scenes with Martha talking about her last summer. The actress who played her literally glowed with life and made it even more poignant that the real Martha was probably like that. It made Martha seem like a real person rather than a victim. Id definitely recommend watching this.',pos
'I am having a hard time finding the words to explain just how much I detested this movie. The historical trial of Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and the Duc de Praslin is a tragic and compelling story that I feel had the potential to be a fantastic film but failed. <br /><br />Although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself it in no way could make up for the terrible structure of the film the badly written script and most of all the horrendously overacted characters. The worst of them were the Ducs children who were so over-the-top-corny and sickeningly fake that it was almost painful to watch.<br /><br />In conclusion this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and profoundly disappointed.',neg
'This is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark - half man type critter on an uncharted island then calls up all his old business and academic buddies to come and see his creation (evil laugh) but actually he wants his sharkman to kill them! Lots of bad GCI goofy plot elements and babes sweating in tight T-shirts follow.<br /><br />These monster movies all follow a similar formula but this one spices things up with a bit of humor (I guarantee the folks who made this had tongues firmly planted in cheek) not to mention the sexy babes. But lets mention those sexy babes - several hot babes in tight T-shirts sweating profusely. Ones in her undies at the beginning another at the end. Thank you thank you makers of bad movies! The plot is full of goofy stuff a guy drives up in a jeep slams it right into a tree then offers to fly everyone off the island in a helicopter. Yeah um well how bout we think about that for a while; well get back to you. The sharkman is hilarious - either awful CGI or an equally comedic guy in a rubber suit. The mad scientist gives a pretty good performance; hes evil thats his motivation he makes no apologies.<br /><br />Overall if you want a stupid FUN B-movie this one should do the job.',pos
'Peter Ustinov plays an embezzler who is just getting out of prison when the film begins. As soon as he walks out the gates he immediately begins working on a scheme to once again make a bundle by stealing though this time he has his sights set pretty high. This is actually one of the weak points about the film as he apparently knows nothing about computers (few did back in 1968) but manages to become a computer genius literally overnight! Yeah right. Anyway he comes up with a scheme to impersonate a computer expert and obtain a job with a large American corporation so he can eventually embezzle a ton of cash. Considering his knowledge of computers is rudimentary its amazing how he puts into effect a brilliant plan AND manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses. But its a movie after all so I was able to suspend disbelief. By the end of the film he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) are able to run away with a million pounds.<br /><br />At the very end though it gets very very confusing and Smith announces shes managed to actually accumulate more than two million by shrewd investing in the companies that Ustinov started (though she didnt realize they were all dummy companies). This should mean that eventually these stocks she bought were worthless. What they seem to imply (and I could be guessing wrong here) is that Ustinov and his new partners quickly cashed in the stocks before this became known and the stocks would thereby then become worthless. Either way the film seems to post on a magical ending whereby no one is hurt and everyone is happy--and this just didnt make much sense. Its a shame really as the acting and most of the writing was great. Karl Malden Bob Newhart Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just wonderful.<br /><br />If I seem to have interpreted the end let me know as the film seemed very vague in details at the end.',pos
'Misguided miscast murky interminable lunacy given the high-gloss MGM A-budget treatment. Kate Hepburn plays a bride who comes to suspect her rich handsome husband (Robert Taylor)is not the dreamboat she married but a psychotic killer. MGMs attempt at a Hitchcockian thriller is doomed from the start by a turgid muddled ludicrous script and the idiotic casting of Hepburn as a jeopardized woman fearing for her life (who could ever imagine Hepburn afraid of anything?) Louis B. Mayer forgot to tell Vincent Minnelli he was directing a thriller not a musical. Taylor is embarrassing. Only Robert Mitchum also cast-against-type as a good guy retains his dignity in a quiet low-keyed performance. Karl Freunds ravishing cinematography creates images of eerie beauty--and was wasted on the wrong film. End result: Metros Parnell of the 1940s.',neg
'The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield Ann revere Lilli Plmer William Conrad Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe. This remake is abominable. In spite of the presence of Rod Steiger Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Beals there is nothing of value here and it is a shame this product bears the same title as the brilliant original. Only the main characters name Charlie Davis is the same in both films. I dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake. I am amazed that Rod Steiger participated. This may be the only bad film he ever made. Maybe he needed the paycheck.',neg
'- A small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money. Of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesnt care who he has to kill to get it. The punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life.<br /><br />- If this sounds ridiculous it is. The whole idea that this Izod-wearing dune buggy-driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in Rome is just plain silly. His friend may be good with a gun but hes up against a group of trained killers. The old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob. Theres also a sub-plot about how the friends father was killed years ago by the mob boss but theres little made of it and it doesnt help the movie any at all.<br /><br />- The mob boss Mister Scarface is played by Jack Palance. I suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek. Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast doing what he must to get a paycheck.<br /><br />- Ive seen some pretty good Italian crime/cop flicks recently but Mister Scarface isnt one of them. Check out Syndicate Sadists or Revolver instead.',neg
'Ill tell you a tale of the summer of 1994. A friend and I attended a Canada Day concert in Barrie and it was a whos who of the top Canadian bands of the age. We got there about 4am waited in line most of the morning and when the doors opened at 9am we were among the first inside the gates. We then waited and waited in the hot sun slowly broiling but we didnt care because the headliners were among our favourites. At one point early in the afternoon I sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier. I was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a Rheostatics t-shirt. This is the reason I have hated the Rheostatics to this day. Theres nothing reasonable nor taste-determined nor really anything except their fandom. Snotty of me isnt it? So I in my hatred of the band have denied myself the delight that is Whale Music.<br /><br />Desmond Howl had it all. Its hard to say what hes lost since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains (the BC region where the movie was shot is breathtaking). The life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams phantoms and his own past until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in...and trite as it sounds breaks him out.<br /><br />Canadian cinema suffers from several problems. Generally a lack of money as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help (as if somehow the feature would cease to be Canadian) leads to lower production values than American or British films and most people dont like to watch anything that sounds or looks like well not like an American film. Next Canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story and tell it well. Third they seem to think that gratuitous nudity (often full-frontal) makes something artistic. Im sure anyone who watches enough Canadian movies especially late at night on the CBC knows exactly what Im talking about. Its almost like a dont do this handbook exists out there somewhere and Canadian film-makers threw it out a long time ago.<br /><br />In the 90s and 00s however some films (such as Bruce McDonalds work and the brilliant C.R.A.Z.Y.) have broken this mold and managed to maintain what makes them Canadian while holding onto watchable production values and great stories. Whale Music is such a film on the surface. Deeper than just its Canadian-isms its a deeply moving story of a man whos lost his grip through grief and excess who is redeemed by music then by love. And that redeems even the Rheostatics. :)',pos
'I saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it. So charming and so very romantic. David Duchovny and Ms. Driver have chemistry that is so hot you will need to take off a layer of clothing. The supporting cast is 100\% top notch. Just watching Caroll OConnor and Robert Loggia play off one another is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen. Like Jim Belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep FOREVER! or him dancing in the kitchen. This film made we wish I knew people like that in my own life. Not to mention what woman does not want David Duchovny for a boyfriend?',pos

'The above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit <br /><br />EroticScary Suspenseful Well thought out these are all the things this film fails to be.<br /><br />It is however incredibly funny the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies I have seen in recent years. And yet this film doesnt even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse.<br /><br />Throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like Santa Claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground. This made me fail to believe the films title if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting? Oh well whatever besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title. Such as this one; there has been a virus sweeping through America creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist. And yet theres only four zombies in the entire film. Another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted. Surely youd see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit. In fact I believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didnt have a high enough budget to film in a wider location that or the director didnt want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters.<br /><br />In fact the director had so much fun doing this that he didnt have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor. And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous whilst I assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels editing isnt a hard job anyway right? The only reason this movie found its way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with Freddy vs Jason strange how these things happen isnt it. And the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess.<br /><br />Oh yes we did laugh at the end but Im sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity...................',neg

Please whatever you do people dont waste your time and money on a crappy movie like D-Wars.',neg
'This was a cute movie until the ending. The ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive/aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her. It is not by chance that she was sitting behind the drivers wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back. This movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them. It was a despicable movie for that reason.',neg
'I saw this film for the first time last night. I have been thinking about it all night and this morning. I cannot say that it was my favorite film at least not yet. I need to see it again. <br /><br />The cinematography is stunning. Each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has Wim Wenderss name attached to it.<br /><br />It is always tempting to see de Chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom but in this case the analogy fits. In many ways the figure of Malkovich walking through the fog and wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the off-canvas statue that haunts Milan in the major works of the Italo-Greek painter. He is slightly menacing a presence who watches and in his capacity as a film director exerts influence on the entire story. <br /><br />The dedicated Wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of Damiel and Cassiel wandering through the streets of Berlin watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants. And following the Himmel Uber Berlin metaphor the angel (or in this case Malkovich the Director) gets to interact with one of the stories. <br /><br />At this point I have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far. I need to see the movie again. I am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring Malkovichs monologue together. <br /><br />Perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication. Maybe that is the whole point of it. No one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework.<br /><br />We must be careful when throwing around the word pretentious. It is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension but that leads to a terrifying mental state one in which the only conversation seen as genuine earthy or authentic is the most banal. When we shun all discussions of philosophy God existence meaning and all that brain candy we are setting our culture up to die a slow stupid and ugly death. Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us. It certainly is not the only theme of the film but I think that it cannot be ignored.<br /><br />The other (and most obvious) leitmotif is that of satisfaction. There is a lot here on that and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the 1000 word limit for this review.<br /><br />My advice is to see the film. But I offer a caveat: it is not an autonomous film (at least I dont think so yet). Some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages is one of those films.',pos
'This movie had the potential to be a decent thriller but it was hampered by only having about twenty minutes worth of good script which was mostly used up in the beginning. After that holes started to appear in the story that one could drive a truck through. The movie followed a descending curve from good to ordinary to bad to ludicrous by the time it concluded. Its not recommended.',neg
'STMD! is not a terrible movie but it IS quite forgettable. The lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain. Special effects are imaginative but obvious. The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there of course along with the archetypical teenagers but the whole movie just doesnt gel. What was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor.<br /><br />I cant really recommend that you use your time watching this movie. I often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor but these are sadly lacking in this film.',neg
'I admit that I am a vampire addict: I have seen so many vampire movies I have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed by the original John Carpenters Vampires and when I descovered there was a sequel I went straight out and bought it. This movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first and it is not quite so dark but it is close enough and I felt that it built nicely on the original.<br /><br />Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives. One of my favourite parts was just after he meets Zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems. His comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds.<br /><br />The other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film. It is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way Fright Night II grew out of Fright Night. There are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme.<br /><br />If you like vampire movies I would recommend this one. If you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else.',pos
'In Love and War is a simple feel-good TV-film and should be viewed as such.<br /><br />(Possible spoiler)<br /><br />It is the story of a WWII British soldier Newby captured with his commando by the Italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. As the Italians surrender to the Allies the commando is freed and attempts to flee. However the Germans arrive and the commando is captured again. Only Newby injured remains at large. The rest of the film recounts how he is hidden and protected by the Partisans and his survival.<br /><br />(End of spoiler)<br /><br />Based on a true story In Love and War is a refreshingly straightforward film. Half comedy half romance the story is simple and unambiguous. The atmosfera is warm and sunny and the various stereotypes (the desperately unorganized or romantic Italians the serious stern-looking Germans and the phlegmatic and pragmatic British) although unoriginal are still humorous. Nicola Piovanis musical score also adds to the Mediterranean flavour.<br /><br />Although it is far from being a Tea With Mussolini or a La Vita E Bella In Love and War is a sweet simple film that will put a smile and maybe even a little tan on your face.',pos
'A bland title disguises this solidly-carpentered example of old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment this film proves a largely successful hodgepodge of several disparate elements: a period piece a romantic drama a crime movie and a political thriller. Interestingly though made by Fox its protagonists  Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck  were both usually associated with other studios; their on screen chemistry here is palpable and eventually led to marriage in a couple of years time. While a bit too young Taylor is a dashing hero (a Marine personally appointed by President McKinley to uncover the culprits behind an organized clean-up of numerous banks); unsurprisingly no sooner has he tracked them down (led by smooth Brian Donlevy and thuggish Victor McLaglen) that he falls for a chanteuse (naturally Stanwyck) who has thrown her lot with the gang  although truth be told singing is far from being the actress forte! Similarly apart from having to prove his worth to make it into their fold he has to vie with McLaglen for Stanwycks attentions; by the way the practical joker persona of the former reminded me a lot of Charley Chase in SONS OF THE DESERT (1933) which incidentally was likewise directed by William A. Seiter. Later on Taylor is in two minds about involving Stanwyck in the impending bait and tries to offer his resignation to the President while eloping with the girl  but the jealous rival disrupts his plans. The robbery gone awry we find Donlevy dead and the other two in jail; Taylors hopes for McKinleys intervention  having meanwhile learned the identity of the elusive and obviously prominent inside man  are seemingly dashed when the President winds up assassinated himself (a great plot twist though the resulting eleventh-hour suspense feels contrived)! To get back to the films jumble of styles even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste the romantic triangle slows things up and it skimps somewhat on the thriller aspect this emerges a handsome production indeed  with the actors already mentioned ably supported by the likes of John Carradine (who unaccountably disappears after just one scene!) Douglas Fowley Sig Rumann and as two American Presidents Sidney Blackmer (the bubbly Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley).',pos
'Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found wandering around covered in dogs blood. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & others. Ranch hand & ex-priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognises Isabelles symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it. Blanche calls priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo) who is her other daughter Claires (Madison Taylor) ex husband to see Isabelle he confirms Miguels suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside Isabelle & an innocent girl free...<br /><br />Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism & I kept asking the same question over & over again why do I do it. Why do I keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder? Right lets honest about this Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete total & utter unashamed rip-off of The Exorcist (1973) & you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share. Theres the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past misdemeanours against others the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctors the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things. I suppose where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (other than its total crap) is that it tries to give all the characters some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but its so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring. The film starts with Isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the characters are poorly written & fleshed out. At times I wondered whether Blackwater Valley exorcism was a spoof theres a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed Isabelle with horse tranquilisers & after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back! There are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. The film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at least.<br /><br />According to some text before the opening credits Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on Actual Events yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called The Exorcist... This piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest. There isnt even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up theres a scene of a cut arm theres a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix & thats about it. Theres surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive. I would imagine the only reason Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breasts are seen. One pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it. There is zero scares no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $1000000 I must say that I am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly & cheap throughout. There are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom. The acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite Jeffrey Combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time. Even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache & a terrible accent he is better than this.<br /><br />Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete rip-off of The Exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic & the makers are thirty five years too late anyway. A total turkey from start to finish.',neg

'Mickey Rooney (as Mi Taylor) is a young man drifting along the figurative road to ruin where he meets 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor (as Velvet Brown) - she adores horses but he has a sad history with the animals. Ms. Taylor is enamored with Mr. Rooneys horse-sense; she takes him home and gets him room and board with her family. They are supported very well by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp (as Mr. and Mrs. Brown). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylors strained siblings.<br /><br />The plot of National Velvet is implausible to a fault; for example the circumstances leading to Taylors ride in the Big Race are quite a stretch (but were likely more believable on paper). Still the characters connection to horses and to Ms. Reveres character are nicely conceived. Rooney and Taylor are excellent in the starring roles; there is a balance between Rooneys fading child star and Taylors exuberant new child star which adds depth to their characterizations.<br /><br />The excellent performances of Rooney and Taylor are further enhanced by fine direction photography and editing from Clarence Brown Leonard Smith and Robert Kern.

There maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch and the cinematic are a little slipshod the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it.

'This is really the only chance to see the magic of James Joyces writing brought to life. His novels are all unfilmable (in any real sense) and this is the only long story he wrote. It was John Hustons last film and did not reach the screen until after he had died and it is easy to see his touch of greatness. The Dead is poetical in its approach on the screen telling us more about Ireland than any modern movie on the IRA and the troubles could ever hope to tell us. Hopefully more people will watch this film and get to experience the finest of both John Huston and James Joyce and perhaps visit this story in your local bookstore (and discover that it is probably the greatest short story ever put on paper).',pos
'...dislike this movie and everyone would understand why. The plot is poor so is the acting. But in my opinion it is better than Halloween 5 although even this does not give many surprising moments.

I do not despise violence in movies but H6 features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes which do not fit to the tradition of the Halloween-Movies.

What a disappointing movie! First its not a comedy; its a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that its even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second the plot is so boring and leads nowhere It has no structure it just flows like the wind in one or another direction The production is also bad! The sound mixing is horrible because sometimes the voices are disconnected. It made me remind some old Portuguese movies from the 80s The acting should have been better too Well to sum up its not with films like this one that Portuguese cinema will improve!

Bad argument bad acting bad production I had no high hopes for this movie but it was much worse than Ive ever imagined! Just forget about it!',neg
'The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least all I lost was $3.00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb. The crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. When the female lead and the FBI guy went to the alleged killers location Mr. FBI handed the female a revolver. When the alleged killer came out the door the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic. One is left to ponder would an FBP agent hand a weapon to a civilian? I think not. Ms. Xavier appears to be a very attractive female. It is too bad the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen. It would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out.',neg
'Let me just give you guys some advice if your going to watch this movie just to see a bunch of unlikable characters get slaughtered in a dozen different ways then you are going to love this movie because everyone dies a horrible death beyond the gore however there is not much else.<br /><br />where should i start: -the characters do not appeal to the audience as there are no back stories for any of them there for i didnt feel connected to any of them in fact i didnt like any of them and i was so sick of them that by the end of the movie i was rooting for the disfigured creep to kill them all.(which he did by the way)<br /><br />-bad acting; i mean i didnt get it take the Asian tour guide for example first he spoke perfect English then after their little tour boat thing sunk he somehow got an accent out of the blue then later on went to speaking normal English.<br /><br />-one of the worst endings for a horror:(if you can call it that)after the monster/human mutant thing kills almost everyone he is killed by the last two remaining idiots or so they thought! the monster/human thing is finally killed when the beauty and the geek stick a pole through its heart/nick(it was hard to tell)and presumably it died right in front of them(within arms reach) but later on it comes back and kills them(wtf) i mean why didnt it just kill them when he was right next to them. Arghhhh! i mean it was just way too retardedit was like the writer didnt know where he wanted the story to go.(or he was a few minutes short of 80 min so he added some more retarded twists to the movie so people can get 80min worth of crap instead of 75min.<br /><br />what i didnt get was why didnt they just kill the damned thing while it was unconscious instead they just walked away from it like idiots and left it so it could come back and kill them. the only reason i gave it a 4 was because of the gore which was actually the only thing that i watched this movie to the end for that and to watch them all get killed.(no im serious)',neg
'To preface my remarks on the film I know the topic is horrendous and words cant adequately express the compassion any decent person would have for people dealing with the post-horrors of an atomic bomb dropped near them. <br /><br />However this film doesnt really deal with in a horrific way except for the first 10 minutes. Some of the images there are horrifying and should be as a reminder what devastation nuclear weapons can produce. Seeing burned people walking around aimlessly or man combing his hair and clumps of hair coming out etc. is not a pretty sight. <br /><br />But after the first dozen minutes this Japanese film concerns people dealing with the aftermath of Hiroshima in the mid-to-late 40s. I actually found the story developing quickly into a boring soap opera. <br /><br />Almost all the story occurs five years after the bomb and deals mainly with one familys problems at that point. This is why it became more of a melodrama than some shocking story of nuclear disaster. Its simply a story about how these people got on with their lives from about 1950 on whether one of the women was permanently damaged and if so should she marry? <br /><br />This could have been a real impact film but it didnt go in that direction',neg
'I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent Short History of Nearly Everything and what I was able to choke down in A Brief History of Time it sounded interesting at times. However the obvious nonsense of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous. I really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually channelling some loony named Ramtha completely upset the applecart for me.<br /><br />What a waste of two hours.',neg
'Hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade B performance and he delivers a rather good one. Outside of Madsen and Hopper the acting is horrid; youve seen better at your local high school. The sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of B-movies. The scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes Ive ever seen (it doesnt even come close to fitting in the movie). The script was probably a great 10-page outline but when it comes out to a full-length movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies Madsen left behind. I do have to say Hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the Hummer had me laughing out loud but I dont think that was the intent. Yes there is a little style and Hopper can always draw my interest. However the interesting plot concept never pays off and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this.',neg
'I am a lover of bad movies. I own R.O.T.O.R. and Boa vs. Python and am working to build up my collection to such great titles as Troll 2 and Whats up Superdoc? But Storm Trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies. Its just lame. The guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right. Everything about this movie is stupid. When the robot guy runs into the car it seems almost as if he knew it was going to blow up there was just no reason he would ever run in that direction. Judge Jury and Executioner The perfect cop...but they went too far I mean come on why do people bother making these movies anymore? R.O.T.O.R. makes it because it is hysterically awful but Storm Trooper is just a waste of cinema because it isnt even bad enough to be so bad its worth watching. This belongs in someones home movies collection something they can be sort of proud of but that is all. I am p*ssed off it was on an HBO channel (with only 1-star which is why I watched it) because it didnt belong there. Even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie. It is shameful.',neg
'Oh my GOD ! I can truly say that Maya Angelou is one of the worlds most intriguing and important people especially of my culture. She is incredibly inspiring and her story is the story of a great woman ! When I first picked this movie up I thought to myself the cast was wonderfully put together now lets see them in action ! Maya Angelou is already my favorite PoetEss and now one of my favorite actresses and speakers. I believe she is the greatest of all time. This movie had me on the edge of my seat and reaching for Kleenex while at the same time reminding me that no matter where you come from if you decide that you are going to be great then you will be great !

'This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting. Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to boost sagging ratings. The owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago. So they hire the fake preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down the murderess who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a fake name. The preacher arrive on the daughters wedding day but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives.<br /><br />Bogart is always good. Hayden is good the the slimy preacher and Henry ONeill is good as the father. Everyone else is just awful. Helen McKeller wins no sympathy (crucial for the role) Linda Perry is a lousy actress Beverly Roberts is OK but always looks old Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh have no parts Carlyle Moore is a dud as the boy friend Virginia Brissac is miscast as the society mother Robert Middlemas overacts as the station owner.<br /><br />This one comes in under an hour but is a pale copy of the original which boasted dynamic performances by Edward G. Robinson Aline MacMahon Frances Starr and Boris Karloff. But its always worth watching Boagrt.',pos

'Im a Black man living in a predominantly Black city. That being said I have some major misgivings about Tyler Perrys work. I realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him because hes Black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture. But I honestly do believe that were Perry White this film would have had the NAACP Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson all over his ass.<br /><br />I have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil. The characters are poorly written and acted. The jokes are so bad I have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny. Im just going to break this big pile of sh-t down.<br /><br />Madea=suck. The character may have had some appeal but it doesnt anymore. When the only thing she ever seems to do is smack around children and threaten adults with violence she is less than useless. She is unnecessary.<br /><br />The situation with the wife beating fiancé was horsesh-t. If a woman was so scared to death of her husband why would she try to run away when hes sleeping in bed. Wouldnt it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work. At any rate the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that I hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticked when he didnt.<br /><br />Then there are the two lovebirds. A bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while hes making his rounds. I couldnt believe it. I really couldnt believe when she agreed to go out with him even more. But what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebbles at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch. I dont use this term lightly but that woman only had two modes. Morose victim and psycho momma. No matter which of these two faces she showed however there was one constant. The bus driver wasnt going to get any. He even married her without sampling the goods--WTF! <br /><br />Then theres the family reunion scene. Here weve got the mother load which includes implied incestual taboos grinding for the sake of grinding shirtless overly musclebound b-ball plus the great taste of Maya Angelou. When those babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting was I wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack. All this crap is going on at the reunion in laughably easy to separate groups and then they ring a bell. When they do everyone drops what theyre doing and heads on over for a stern talking too just like a pack of Pavlovs doggies--WTF!! <br /><br />Then you have the final five minutes of the film. In it we see the abusive fiancé get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress. There is an impromptu wedding where Black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceiling--WTF!!! The only reason to watch it this far besides testing your threshold for pain is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well. Guess what it doesnt happen. Instead Perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safe ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness--WTF!! <br /><br />Im pretty sure that if given a day  I could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks. Dont even get me started on the rest of Tyler Perrys films. Im just going to say this. In my opinion as a Black guy D.W. Griffiths legacy lives on. The irony is that it is doing so through a Black man who will be praised for doing what Birth of a Nation did selling us down the river. I only wish Perrys films were dudes so I could kick them in the nuts. Thanks a lot dude!! What are you going to follow this up with in 2009 a comedy about the raping and savage beating of slaves in Colonial America?',neg

But if one night you wanna watch something not serious and dont have and high expectations I strongly recommend Demon Summer. Yes the lines are cheesy and the plot is corny. But it contains key elements of a horror/comedy. I just wanna see some small-town kids make a movie full of effects. And I say bravo to the Campell brothers. They are now making more movies and continuing a long dream. Demon Summer was one of the movies that are gonna help them start a great career with a great future.

'This film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural Russia as she lays dying.<br /><br />I am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience. On one hand the film is beautiful with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings. There is really nothing to say because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. The son shows so much care love and patience towards his mother that I think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards ones family. It also cruelly reminds me that I could be in a situation like this stuck in a joyless place having to take care of a very ill person. Mat I Syn is cruel reality.<br /><br />On the other hand Mat I Syn moves really too slowly. Do I really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute? With my previous experience of Telets and Aleksandra I am so tempted to put Mat I Syn among them as a total bore.<br /><br />I guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film. I surely see the beauty of it but maybe I am not in the right state of mind.',neg
'I always felt that a good film should have a plot. This particular film was missing one and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was anxious for it to finally end. However I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict. Its not the worst movie Ive seen but I used to say that it was until I saw The Fast And The Furious. So dont think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. I actually hate most action films out today; its just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum.

'I wish Id known more about this movie when I rented it. Id put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the movie were charming much of the movie felt contrived undeveloped or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple... I dont care how big a part of the story line that is it still felt a bit um gross. And Charlie for a zoologist she certainly doesnt seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (besides her hotness and some common interests) that made Gray fall for her? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion) the cabbie in drag and the dance sequences (if Sam & Gray were such great dancers I wish wed seen more of that as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie). Could have been better.',neg
'To summarize this movie: Without a real plot this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes. The music is just awful the humor isnt funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks. It seems to me that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy who thinks that drinking is cool women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks. Also the movie has nothing to do with the original American Pie movies other than a few names and Mr. Levenstein who is a minor character in this one. The only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls. Dont watch this movie and dont be fooled by the 5.4 rating because it obviously overrated and doesnt deserve anything above 2.',neg
'This is an excellent Anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of UFO or SPACE 1999 (first series). Of course it isnt some SFX extravaganza or Star Wars pseudo-mystic tripe fest but a subtle movie that has a slow pace yet it conveys the creepy eerie and uncanny atmosphere of the best Anderson productions: for lovers of cerebral sci-fi.

'Is this film a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it isnt a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intended humor but on quite a few occasions the poor acting poor directing and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake. The killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. At the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love. It is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna Austria and shows what a beautiful city it is. Do not waste your time on this film though unless you are studying how NOT to act direct or script a film!',neg
'One of the many backwoods horrors that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film because I thought it was really good and really entertaining although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.<br /><br />First of all we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive it doesnt seem very dangerous at all well according to me anyway. Its a shame that we dont get movies like this any longer and if we do its usually some boring terrible film.<br /><br />This movie more relies on tension and being scary than gore because the gore factor is really low in this movie which I wasnt pleased with but other than that its still a great movie.<br /><br />All in all youll have to search long and hard to find this movie and if you do find it you will like it and also watch out for ending with the final girl and the killer its totally not what youd expect.',pos
'A wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie. 75+ \%entertainment. Casey Buddy Kelly Marsh are very interesting and lovable characters. The horses are real beauties.<br /><br />Has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense. Shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to.<br /><br />Andrew Rubin puts in a wonderful performance as Buddythe sensible elder brother. Somewhat reminded me of Aidan Quinn(eyes speech delivery facial appearance). <br /><br />Casey makes you fall in love with the character because of the earnestness. Sarah Blue is also nicely portrayed by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle the father is played by Walter Matthau and he IS the character.<br /><br />Though there is room for improvement in the movie its a very enjoyable feel-good movie.',pos
'As a kid I grew up with the chintzy 60s TV series (and no Im not that old POW!). However when director Tim Burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen I simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hyped-latest additions (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight) which I dont really care for. Even if theyre going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche further but in honesty I dont think theres all that much to tap in to. I wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes thats what Burton brought across and this is the reason why I can watch them over and over again. <br /><br />After wowing audiences with the 1989 Batman thanks to the gaudily Gothic art direction and Jack Nicholson take no-prisoners performance of the camped-up but psychotic Joker. Burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far; Batman Returns. Camp but well-done. In what would fair up to being even more expansive louder dreary and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one. Enter the grotesque Penguin (with Danny DeVito magnificently going out on a limb) and the ravishing Catwoman (a steamy Michelle Pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely) coming to spoil Gothams party. Again Batman (an aptly brooding Michael Keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit look at the eyes) plays second fiddle to the bad guys but I always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. And his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served too. Burtons illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek Gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes. The moody narrative (in what probably is a tad too long) is more so symbolic in its progression rather show-piecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set-pieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and grey/blue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop. The magnetically free-flowing camera-work takes flight and Danny Elfmans stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull. The rest of the performances might be overshadowed but Christopher Walken digs in his teeth into a smarmily glassy role of a two-faced businessman Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back but gets very little to do as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough is delightful as Alfred. In solid support are Michael Murphy Andrew Bryniarski Vincent Schiavelli Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also makes a cameo appearance.',pos
'The title of this obscure and (almost righteously) forgotten 80s slasher inevitably reminds me of The Cures mega-smash-monster hit song with the same title hence a piece of the lyrics in the title-section of this user comment. Also I didnt have anything else to say that was useful anyway. But hey The Forest isnt totally hopeless and not even *that* bad actually. If nothing else at least it obeys the admittedly unwritten first rule of 80s slasher: kill someone within the first 10 minutes of playtime. Sure youve heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before but dont let that discourage you from watching it as The Forest has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image. Its actually a bit of an atypical 80s slasher! The main characters arent ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism. The concept isnt always successful let alone plausible but its more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy. Two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of California but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands. Barely set up for the night they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children the children themselves and finally the father whos out hunting for human flesh. The demented family may be real or imaginary but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive they have already vanished. The men too encounter the family and they find out more about the slightly dysfunction background. The Forest is a weird and unusual film to say the least. Its not exactly a masterpiece of plotting but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to open-minded fans of 80s horror. The murders are fairly gruesome and will-filmed including a slit throat and a painful saw-massacre and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful. The more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists the less it makes any sense so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer. The acting performances are just above average the music is okay and at least director Donald Jones (also responsible for the 70s exploitation-sickie Schoolgirls in Chains) tried to be a little more creative that the majority of 80s horror films. Too bad it ultimately fails.',neg
'Im not entirely sure Rob Schmidt qualifies as a Master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called Wrong Turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with Right to Die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the Masters of Horror franchise. There was a similar underdog story in season one when William Malone made on of the best episodes with The Fair Haired Child even though his other long feature films Fear Dot Com and House on Haunted Hill sucked pretty badly.<br /><br />The story of Right to Die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous conspiracies pitch black humor and comic book styled violence. Whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husbands continuous adultery the Addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident. Cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife Abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially. Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney (Corbin Bernsen of The Dentist) want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor Abbeys mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff. Meanwhile Abbeys hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in Cliffs surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices. After a few victims Cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well. Right to Die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff I always hoped to see from a TV-series concept like Masters of Horror. Its violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences. The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons. The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling. Actresses Julia Anderson and Robin Sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is always a welcome plus and Corbin Bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard. Great MoH episode; definitely one of the highlights of both seasons.',pos
'If like me you actively seek out the rarest and weirdest (and often most awful) that world cinema has to offer then you should look no further than the supernatural horror output of Hong Kong in the early 80s. Often mixing bizarre black magic with kung fu and silly comedy and usually packed with plenty of creepy crawlies (snakes worms eels centipedes etc.) these movies are about as bizarre as it gets.<br /><br />Succubare is definitely a case in point: featuring a mountain tribe whose women keep their men from straying by casting nasty spells over them (that should they leave cause them to fill up with writhing creatures and die an agonising death) some so-so martial arts and lots of real life animal killing (much of which is perpetrated by a geek who has absolutely no bearing on the story) this film is just plain strange.<br /><br />A prolonged scene in which the tribeswomen hunt for snakes and insects casually throwing the creatures into the baskets on their backs is quite fascinating; a tribal feast that sees a poor ox bashed on the head and then torn apart is totally disgusting; and the moments that show worms crawling in open wounds and being vomited onto the floor will have the squeamish losing their appetite for a while.<br /><br />However its the live animal munching that really qualifies Succubare for legendary status amongst fans of out-there movie-making. Its thoroughly vile to watch and yet strangely compelling: the geek chomps on a snake woofs down a fat juicy toad (nasty!) and hungrily devours a mouse (biting off its head and then shoving the rest in afterwards).<br /><br />Not a great movie (hell its not really even a mediocre movie) Succubare is recommended only to people who think theyve seen it all. This one gets 4 out of 10 from me which is probably more than it deserves but I begrudgingly respect it for being able to make me feel slightly ill.',neg
'SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I watched half of this movie and I didnt like it. <br /><br />First reason: Boring. Barely anything happens the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope they smoke weed read magazines care for their sick friend and cut up the occasional dead body. BORING!!!!<br /><br />Second reason: There are too many things left unexplained. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men restrains them in a chair and interrogates them. Who are these men? How do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the diseased flesh eaters? Why does he kill one and let another one go?<br /><br />Also there is this dude who at first I thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting hes not quite what we originally thought-never explained! How frustrating is that? <br /><br />Conclusion: I found the women annoying the story uninteresting the duologue tedious and the action non-existent. Also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly isnt. I rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website and although I respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick I will from now on make sure I read more than two reviews deep into a movie so as to avoid renting another movie I regret seeing.',neg

'We all have seen some unending epics in our times but this one really tops them all! The movie is so long and so slow that just to put things in perspective i felt a lot older when i left movie hall than I entered it. At almost 4 hours length it could have rather been made into a tele-serial.<br /><br />What starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace. Nikhil advani has woven the plot around 6 love stories and he cant make justice to any one of them... There is no interconnection between them to start with and links shown in last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to connect the story.<br /><br />Situation is made worse by Silly dialogues (most of them repeated in Hindi cinema over years)and stupid cinematography.<br /><br />Priyanka doesnt realise that she actually needs to play her role rather than just looking glam on screen... An utter waste of beauty without acting skills.<br /><br />And then there is loud-is-humorous Govinda & my-face-twists-better-than-jim-carrey Akshay Khanna who keep belching at the top of their lungs to irritate already tired viewers.<br /><br />Only good part in movie is John & Vidyas love story & nice acting/comedy by sohail & Isha. But they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without jumbling it with other bunch of characters. Their brilliance gets lost in the midst of other substandard plot lines.<br /><br />My guess - Director was making two separate movies(may be more!) and some beginner assistant mixed up all the records beyond a point of sorting them out so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie...<br /><br />Watch it only if you want to test your patience!!!',neg

Any D fan will LOVE this movie (even though its a tad short) and cameos from John C Reilly Ben Stiller Tim Robbins Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (just about recognisable) prove that the D rock hard enough for anyone. Even Dio... The sasquatch/mushroom scene is going to become an instant classic (I dont want to say any more and be accused of putting spoilers in here). Fans of the original HBO series will see a couple of nods to the Ds early on-screen appearances in characters such as Lee and the open mic host. I only wish that they had played a few of the songs from the first album and the omission of the government totally sucks from the POD album is also a shame. Other than that this movie rocks. Obey the D!',pos
'This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Although he is quite grown up it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process. Moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father. When the cargo burns she and crew members are evacuated to our lads ship. However the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where Moran is concerned. The inevitable ensues - our lad falls for the mannish Moran and she for him. In the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united. Some interesting dialogue points out that Moran belongs to no man -and no woman. (A nod to Sappho here). Dorothy Dalton is appropriately sexless as Moran and not too attractive either. Valentino does well in a romantic action role. His sexy build and physique are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a masculine one. He is very appealing. This is no great film but it passes the time. What it really showcases is Valentinos beauty and sexiness.',neg

'Bette Midler is the best thing about this movie. It is a POOR second to the original from 1962 with Natalie Wood as Gypsy. The songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bettes voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to Cynthia Gibb. Only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie.<br /><br />There was not enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl. When Natalie Wood was Gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show. When she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time Gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star not just a poor substitute to her sister. And the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were rushed through. It was an important part of the movie and they butchered it. It is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original. It was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie. I was completely disappointed and had it not been for Bette Midler I would have shut the movie off.',neg
'The gang is back for more! Ron Howard and Cindy Williams are now married! Her brother is demonstrating against the draft and Charles Martin Smith is doing everything he can in Vietnam to get sent home.<br /><br />The issues of the 60s are brought to light here but its all over the place beginning with New Years Eve 1963 then three minutes later its New Years Eve 1964 then three minutes later its New Years Eve 1965 then three minutes later its back to 1963 again. Martin Smith is talking about his friend dying in a drag race a year ago and a couple of scenes later this friend is winning his next heat in a drag race and to top it all off the drug scene and the flower children enter the picture (or pictures in some cases as many as three different camera shots are shown on the screen at the same time).<br /><br />If you want to watch this film you have to WATCH this film but Id advise you to stick to the original and leave it there. Wolfman Jack is heard in the beginning of the film before almost every song played in the background but whered he go? Maybe HE couldnt keep up with this film either and quit! 2 out of 10 stars!',neg

'If you are looking for a movie that doesnt take itself seriously... than Haggard is for you. I must say before i write anything more that if you have not seen any of the CKY (Camp Kill Yourself) videos than the movie most likely wont be AS funny. My advice is to watch a few clips of those videos that Bam and his friends made. Haggard does not take itself seriously AT all and that was never the purpose. Throughout the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot which may get annoying but its nothing that is out of control. Even through all that the plot does stay focused and the story of Ryan Dunns character does unfold quite nicely. This plot i have been told is based off a true story (for the most part)of Ryan Dunns ex-girlfriend. Brandon Dicamillo is by far the best character in the movie. He has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh. He stole the movie if you ask me. Overall I love this movie for its simplicity and straight up weirdness. Its a Bam movie people its not going to be normal. Haggard is filled with hilarious quotes that my friends and I constantly used since the first time we saw it. Ive seen the movie 6-7 times and still find new things every time. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar Kill to New Order and some techno. Just dont go into the movie with high expectations let it all unfold and then judge it for what it is.',pos
'I was a child when I saw this serial a bit after seen Buck Rogers one both characters performed by the same Buster Crabbe and I must acknowledge that these films have always been part of the best entertainment Ive ever had. The fight against Emperor Ming was one thing but I was more interested to know about the final fate of the love triangle of Flash with Dale and Aura. Barin came and persuaded Aura to forget Flash very innocent termination of her obsession for good-looking Flash. The serial has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences. Another thing is that I learned floating in water looking the way Crabbe did it when fighting against shark men. The soundtrack was also nice although it was used previously in another film of Boris Karloffs Frankenstein. It would be nice to have the DVD of this serial provided that it comes with subtitles in Spanish (not yet available).',pos
'NO SPOILERS!!<br /><br />After Hitchcocks successful first American film Rebecca based upon Daphne DuMariers lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period - mistaken identity and espionage. As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale war effort of civilians building planes weaponry and other necessary militia the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good law abiding citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcocks sensibilities.<br /><br />This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who dont believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful freaks and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security he falls madly in love with! Of course in the land of Hitchcock Patricia kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix.<br /><br />In good form for this outing Hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies average Joes and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving. Its a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited culminates in one of Hitchcocks more memorable finales. Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the war-time shooting ban on public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcocks most well known films its a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual - terrific Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcocks cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film. Hitchcocks original cameo idea that was shot (him fighting in sign language with his deaf wife) was axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf!',pos

'Call me stupid but I absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie Valentine. It was so well-made well-written well-acted well-directed etc! Everything about it was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lilys death) very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com) completely horrifying and creepy (Paiges death) and just plain heartbreaking (the first scene). I think the entire cast did a great job especially the three leads: David Boreanaz Denise Richards (both of whom I met and got autographs from during the filming of this movie - VERY nice people!) and Marley Shelton.<br /><br />I am very sick of people calling this movie another Scream clone. This movie is in no way a Scream clone. In fact this film runs rings around Scream. It actually makes SENSE! Scream was also NOT the only movie to feature a masked killer in it. Excuse me but it looks like Scream was also a clone too (ahem... Friday the 13th Halloween and many other scary movies also featured masked killers). I also think that the novelty of the cupid-masked killer is brilliant. Its so strange to see a sweet cupid face doing all of these horrible things. Another novelty (the nose bleeding) makes way for a fantastic ending! The ending gives me chills every time I see it!!!!! So even if you didnt like it the first time watch Valentine again and give it another chance!<br /><br />PS- Keep an eye out for my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon...',pos
'All I can say after watching Snitchd is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about. If you insist on making movies about gangsters I urge you to do research. Its comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak.<br /><br />I laughed at the part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion. This movie was tough as an after school special. Who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from?. I suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang. That would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related. <br /><br />Snitchd is the WORST gangbanger movie ever made.',neg
'This is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial (just read the other comments on this film). Apparently you either love it or hate it and it seems most people make that distinction based on whether they believe the tribulation and end times will happen as portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Basically the film - and its sequels - were made for about $1.30 each. The production values are right down there with Plan 9 From Outer Space and the acting is about on the same level as Glen or Glenda (my apologies to Ed Wood). Putting aside the religious message the story is as scary as they come. Add in even the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that might happen in the future and it becomes even scarier.<br /><br />This movie and its sequels didnt try to bring in the reasons why the tribulation happened when it did. Left Behind and The Omega Code tried to get in everything Thief did and to explain all the politics and maneuvering in the Middle East leading up to it. The net effect was Thief did a much better job on the scary part of movie instead of spreading itself too thin trying to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /><br />Forget the politics and watch this movie and its sequels for what they are - horror stories. That they may be horror stories told indirectly by God makes them just that much more frightening. If it makes you think about the subject it has done its job - even if you never believe.',neg
'First of all; its very dilettantish to try describe way of history only from positions of guns germs and steel. The same tried to do Marxists from economical positions.<br /><br />The reason of Western success cant be just dumb luck the advantages of domesticated plants and animals.

'Dogtown and Z-Boys<br /><br />Summary: Dogtown and Z-boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers that changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (Dogtown) California as we know it today. With their low pivotal style they embarked on a Larry Bertlemen influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a couple failures. After the Dogtown articles were featured in a reinstated Skateboarder Magazine the sport was revamped and the members of the Zephyr skateboard team forgot about Jeff Ho and looked to be on summer vacation for the rest of their lives by joining other skateboard teams that could afford to pay them like movie stars. The original Zephyr Skateboard Team put together by Jeff Ho (Zephyr Surfshop Owner) and Craig Stecyk (Photographer) included Jay Adams Tony Alva Stacy Peralta Bob Biniak Chris Cahill Shogo Kubo Paul Constantineau Jim Muir Peggy Oki (the only female) Nathan Pratt Wentzle Ruml IV Allen Sarlo and David Ray Perry. All of the original members except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill are still well and surfing/skating. Jay Adams at the time of the documentary was serving time on drug related charges. Chris Cahill at the time of the documentary was last seen in Mexico.<br /><br />Themes: The themes of this documentary are kind of read-between-the-lines but if there were a clear-cut theme it would be that even kids can spark revolutions. Other themes would include extensive partying in ones past may lead to an unfulfilling future and by planning and being careful with ones assets a very rewarding future could be at hand.<br /><br />Other Works: Stacy Peralta (Writer and Director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written produced or directed. Most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding such as Riding Giants Sk8 TV The Bones Brigrades and Lords of Dogtown. He has also done films with a theme of growing up in America as a teenager films such as: Influences: From Yesterday to Today Crips and Bloods: Made in America and The 70s: The Decade that Changed Television.<br /><br />Subjects: The subjects of Dogtown and Z-boys are the original members of the Zephyr Skateboard Team excluding Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk in the interviews. Other subjects were people who grew up during the 70s reading the Dogtown Articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts. Skaters from the Dogtown area but not on the team were interviewed.<br /><br />Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. There were scenes of the subjects talking so that the audience could see who was speaking and get a sense of the character but would immediately cutaway to archival footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when Jay Adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song Old Man by Neil Young was played which evokes many emotions. Sean Penn was the narrator for the film and he explained the transitions throughout the film. The film was presented chronologically from the time the Zephyr surf team was put together to creating the skateboard team to all of the Z-boys leaving the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. <br /><br />Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way. The film of the subjects speaking were all in black and white and all of the archival footage of the Z-Boys surfing or skating were in color. Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film. The interviewees were mostly shot in the same area it appears but all were outside. All of the footage was very well-controlled even the archival footage which I found very surprising. <br /><br />Music: Seasons of Wither-Performed by Aerosmith Toys in the Attic-Performed by Aerosmith Generation Landslide- Alice Cooper One Way Out- Performed by The Allman Brothers Lollipops and Roses and Whipped Cream-performed by Herb Alpert Into the Void and Paranoid- performed by Black Sabbath Godzilla- Blue Oyster Cult Aladdin Sane and Rebel Rebel- David Bowie Fastcars- The Buzzcocks Gut Feeling- Devo Ill Give you Money- Peter Frampton Funk 49- James Gang Ezy Rider and Foxy Lady and Freedom and Bold as Love- Jimi Hendrix Sidewalk Surfing- Jan and Dean Achilles Last Stand and Hot on for Nowhere- Led Zeppelin Six Underground- The Sneaker Pimps Surfrider- The Lively Ones Cat Scratch Fever and Motor City Madhouse and Wang Dang Sweet Poontang- Ted Nugent Us and Them- Pink Floyd Bad Boys- The Pretenders Maggie May- Rod Stewart I Wanna be Your Dog and Gimme Danger- The Stooges Children of the Revolution- T-Rex Bad Reputation- Thin Lizzy Disco Inferno- The Tramps Hannah- Rob Trower Rocky Mountain Way- Joe Walsh Old Man- Neil Young La Grange- ZZ Top<br /><br />The music in the film make the movie.

'This movie is obviously low-budget & filmed in British ColumbiaCanada. The obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie convincing(set in California & late 60s-80s)were well conceived.I believe this is the best & most accurate version of the Zodiac killings that plagued the town of Vallejo & the Bay area from 1968-19? (he was never caught).Edward James Olmos(Det. Dave Toschi) & George Dzundza(Zodiac-at the time believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen since cleared by DNA & fingerprints)play a game of cat & mouse re-visiting crime scenes together each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation.Olmos dying from some type of terminal disease & knowing Dzundza did itstill totally obsessed to the point of losing his family & becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way.Dzundza totally oblivious & self absorbed(like all serial killers) to the carnage left in his wake.The only disappointment was theover the top ending otherwise pretty accurate.If you tire of the typical Hollywood fluff or have an interest in the Zodiac casecheck it out.',pos

I love the music I love when Charlie is arriving in Heaven I love the song Let me be surprised. I love how Charlie looks and his voice Bert Reynolds could only play Charlies voice this great. I love this movie the 1st one is the best one because its so original and great. It really does bring back memories that no one can describe not even me. If only I could go back to those days. I love the characters. If this is the way the memories come back when Im 12 imagine how Ill feel when Im like 19 I hope Ill be able to watch this when Im older. When I first seen this I never knew that I would really look back on it and feel this way  I hope it will be available to watch. Im so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart. On a scale from 1-10 Id give it a perfect 10. Its an amazing movie.

'Mention Bollywood to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the images usually conjured up are of tacky over the top musical numbers peopled with costuming that makes Vegas seem a bastion of conservatism. This perception is not helped by the whiff of condescension that permeates most movies that have approached Bollywood from an outsiders perspective. Willard Carrolls romantic comedy Marigold however takes a different tack. It is not a nudge-nudge wink-wink look at those silly people and their clueless antics but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality its lack of irony and self-consciousness.<br /><br />It is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for Bollywood while at the same time is bemused by its kitschier aspects. And if you have a familiarity with Bollywood you can appreciate what he does here in making a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood movie conventions. From one of the opening shots a flashback of the Salman character as a child by the sea talking with his grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman movies start with this same premise?) to the flashback sequence that is incorporated into the movie that Marigold and Prem has been filming anyone who has seen enough Bollywood movies will recognize these references. The story itself incorporates tried and true conventions from both Hollywood and Bollywood as well  the fish out of water meets duty-to-ones-family-at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot line of the more comical set up of the first half giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second. Yet ultimately the sensibility of the film is that of Hollywood with its understated wry humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself to reach self-affirmation.<br /><br />You couldnt have a movie inspired by Bollywood if there werent any musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them. Unlike Bollywood however the songs do not pop out of nowhere and transport its characters to a European locale or Goan beach; they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film that is being made reminiscent of how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley movies as being part of a stage show. Or they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there  a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a cameo from the playback singer Shaan) performing. All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that point in the movie. Often the music will take a conventional song from one genre and put a twist on it from the other. So in one of the highlights of the film where Marigold comes into her own the song picturazation is fairly typical of its genre  the female star singing and dancing among a line of women  but in this case its blond Ali Larter looking like a total natural Bollywood film star emoting and lip synching to the Hindi lyrics with no subtitles.<br /><br />Also synonymous with Bollywood are sumptuous visuals and Marigold fulfills that aspect beautifully thanks to some of the top talent working in Bollywood today. The cinematographer is Anil Mehta who was also the cinematographer for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and production designer is Nitin Desai both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this film  in fact the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol which coincidentally has an embedded Marigold pattern.<br /><br />As for the cast Carroll obviously has a penchant for spotting acting talent as evidenced by Playing by Heart  one of the first movies for both Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this film he again hits the mark with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons the film works is because of Larter. She makes a bitchy unappealing character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation believable and she is smart funny and sexy because she is smart and funny. She and Salman share excellent chemistry and that is one of the films biggest strengths.<br /><br />Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming here as filtered through his iconic role as Prem. This is old school Prem however so expect a quiet subdued Salman - those used to him in his usual stripping avatar may be disappointed  or relieved! Its a sincere and sensitive performance from him marred only by poor enunciation of his English lines.<br /><br />With a refreshing lack of cynicism and unabashed embrace of romantic love the film is a love letter to Bollywood and Hollywood movies of yore.',pos
'Its unfortunate that you cant go any lower than one star. Prior to watching The Wicker Man I had considered Aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars. In all fairness The Wicker Man doesnt detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it.<br /><br />There is a cheap trick all too often used in Hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion: slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers. Even more so in that the carefully crafted (or however they put it) conclusion didnt seem to follow logically from the plot (which naturally I cant elaborate on without introducing spoilers) and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point.<br /><br />It is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths pedophiles and possibly die-hard Nicholas Cage fans but only to a few of the mainstream audience. If you really want something along these lines I heartily recommend M. Night Shyamalans The Village instead. Lacking some kind of memory-erasing pill I suppose I need to watch something better to force it from my mind say Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Pee-wees Big Adventure?',neg

'While the original 1932 version with Preston Foster was good theres no remake more worthy than this 1959 one or more impossible to find anywhere just as I strongly suspect Mickey Rooney to have had something to do with that. Never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant or a script more thought-provoking as well as an improvement upon the original. Many years after the last of my several viewings of this film in 1970 I read an article in which Mickey Rooney was recounting a visit hed made to death row and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification hed felt with people in similar circumstances. The article was about as short as the main character here and didnt cover much other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized even in language I would not care to explicitly quote here. . . . . One of my main problems with capital punishment is that of course it is not evenly impartially applied just as many innocent people are far-too-carelessly thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate. Another problem I have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough or for that matter even publicly enough! The bible makes a special point in such cases about one of the more important purposes of such as a deterrent being ineffectually obscured minus not only a public viewing but also the direct participation of all! As for those who claim to prove statistically that such is not an effective deterrent? In addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data I have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking. However I do have a problem about the fact that Robert Duvall in The Apostle had been punished at all for his particular crime or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a temporary insanity defense as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case. . . . In addition to various other questions concerning the motives of Mickey Rooney for that particular visit hed recounted and about the answers to which I can only try to speculate I suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature. I dont know exactly when hed become the professing Christian he now makes it a special point whenever possible to emphasize that he is; but as anybody should be well-aware this particular category of people tends to be the most vehemently out for blood when it comes to extracting an eye for an eye. However I have no particular bone of contention concerning that per se just as theres no doubt scripturally speaking that not all and perhaps not even most shall be spared the same ultimate fate at the hands of the Lord Himself as a result of His sacrifice on the cross. However there is a problem for me about the spirit or attitude with which most professing Christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment; for contrary to the Lord Himself who would love to see everybody saved (Ezekiel 18:32) (II Peter 3:9) they seem to go vindictively out of their way to find reasons to condemn! . . . What most people on either side of this superlatively ever-burning issue cannot appear to sufficiently appreciate is that the Lord is as dynamically and elusively soft in nature as He is hard. The two sides of His nature appear to be so inherently incompatible as to render Him mentally deranged at least by any strictly human reckoning. Yet regardless of how harrowingly ungraspable this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in His nature surely is there can be no doubt that anything short of it or anything fanatically and characteristically on either one side or the other of this equation falls inadequately and unacceptably short of the entire judicial truth. Indeed Ive seen the most blood-curdling thirst for the same come out self-contradictorily enough on far-too-many occasions whenever the categorically anti-death penalty advocates are confronted even in the most rationally well-balanced ways with the fact that although the Lord died for everybody not all are thereby going to be saved. After-all in order to receive absolution one must to repeat the same term reach out and receive it that is repent (Luke 13:3-5). Could anything make more sense? . . . But then what about the Lords command to forgive even in the case of ones enemies of those who despise and persecute you without a just cause or provocation? One of the far-too-prevailing difficulties with this kind of sentimentality as popularly misinterpreted is the way it obscuringly over-simplifies the real meaning of forgiveness. The act of forgiveness does not in itself mean the same thing as unconditionally excusing the one being forgiven. When one takes a clearly sober rationally well-balanced view here from the perspective of Gods own attitude all it actually amounts to is a fervent wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way seeing the light and being granted mercy. This attitude is of course the very opposite of say that of Jonah who actually resented it when God told him that his preaching to the people of Nineveh would result in their repentance. Jonah didnt want them to repent but vindictively desired that they be destroyed. How self-righteously cold-bloodedly like unto most professing Christians he was save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most! I envy Jonah almost as much as he would me! However minus the repentance of the one being forgiven any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine Christian is not going to do him any good. In such a case the only one to benefit is the real Christian himself!',pos

She is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that arent the sharpest knifes in the drawer.<br /><br />To start with the one person closest to her in her life her husband Nick is a little off his rocker. He is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile. The rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he isnt there to support her when she needs support. The one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is he is just making her feel worse. She relies on him for support and always goes to him first when she feels she is acting wrong and he does nothing to support her. When she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act instead of comforting her he just yells at her and tells her what to do.<br /><br />The other major people in her life are her parents. Her parents do nothing in her life for her. Mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her. In the end she even asks her father to stand up for her and he doesnt understand and when he does get it he still does nothing. They do nothing to help Mabel recover or to keep her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period. The only person that tries to do something for her is Nicks mom. Nicks mom is adamant about having Mabel committed. She doesnt want to have Nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her. It seems as though everyone is against Mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they wont have to deal with it anymore. They all want to live their own lives and do nothing for Mabel except for yell at her and make her feel like she is doing something wrong when she really isnt. That is why she went crazy and why she had to be committed it was her familys entire fault.',neg
'I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan. I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like him in his serious movies especially Truman Show. This one is a cross between his VERY funny side and his serious side. He is of course VERY funny in this movie but there are parts that are very serious and he pulls it off with a lot of ease. he is truely a multi-function actor.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast I was happy with Jennifer Anistons acting. I think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass. Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God. As for Steven Carell his limited scenes are VERY funny especially in the anchor scene.<br /><br />Overall I would have to rate this a 9. Good acting funny script and some very serious situations make this a very good film.',pos
'I suppose its nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this. With the sometimes pointless excesses of many Hollywood films we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions foul language and corny one-liners. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective when employed properly. However this film is not one of those cases.<br /><br />Take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary sparse scenery. Im sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement. The acting is poor... bland and pedestrian... and features one of the worst crying scenes in history (at the end of the film if you can sit through it to the end). The scenery is drab and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled. I would call this anticlimatic but as the film didnt build to any sort of climax whatsoever... not even in the erotic scenes... it would be untrue. Im sure that there was a script employed during the filming but with the amount of dialogue I think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically this film offers nothing to interest or amaze... no great story no stunning insights no visual drama no excitement. Apart from two or three amusing moments this film is a waste of two hours. A tragically boring and dreary film.',neg
'i guess its possible that Ive seen worse movies but this one is a real stinker! the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it. the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching. hes capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together.<br /><br />angie harmon playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into whos behind the assassination of the president truly butchered the role. there was no chemistry with gooding her demeanor was flat and wooden and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd. this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the b list.<br /><br />and what was cuba gooding thinking??? he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances but this was far beneath what weve come to expect from him.<br /><br />poor james woods and burt reynolds. poor poor poor poor poor.',neg
'THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could direct a mainstream movie if he wanted to. By comparison to his other more artistic works this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness and almost no esoteric elements.<br /><br />The exception being of course the final scene in the hall of mirrors widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of film. It alone is worth the cost of a rental.<br /><br />The sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful Rita Hayworth. Her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters. Even the great Mr. Welles.',pos
'Night Of The Living Homeless is a funny spoof of the 1978 film(and the 2004 remake) of Dawn Of The Dead.Only this time...with the homeless.The episode has homeless people all coming to South Park and the people cannot figure out why.They treat the homeless like zombies who want change and a few of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie.So now its up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them.This is a fairly funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the 2pac/Dr.Dre song California Love.Overall a good episode.<br /><br />8/10',pos
'Its the single unfunniest thing I ever watched. Its sad how he tries so hard to come up with a good joke and all he does is curse and thinks his disgusting vulgarity is funny. He is the most bitter person I ever saw. His whole act he is trying to show how much he doesnt care and by that only showing how much hes angry at the critics and the people with any taste and sense of humor whod rather go through immense torture than go watch his show. There are good comedians there are bad ones and there are horrible ones. But this guy is in a league of his own. I feel sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny.',neg
'A warning to potential viewers: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story The Most Dangerous Game look elsewhere. Seven Women for Satan<br /><br />only superficially addresses the original work by using the name of Zaroff and having said character murder people.<br /><br />Some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoilers. Or not.<br /><br />Boris Zaroff is played by writer/director Michel Lemoine. Whereas his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging Boris victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves. The film rambles from scene to scene with a near-total lack of clarity. The director seems to have totally disregarded pacing and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film. A few individual scenes are mildly interesting (such as a torture rack sequence) but as a unit the film fails to entertain. Viewers who are more<br /><br />interested in an assortment of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in various stages of undress might find the film watchable. Most will probably find their time is better spent watching Mentos commercials.<br /><br />In a side note the DVD extras included a fair amount of information on the films history. Apparently it was banned for several years in its native France which pretty much ruined any chance it had for widespread distribution.',neg
'Well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype; From the buzz at the Toronto Film Festival to gushing reviews on CBC Radio. A refreshing wacky hilarious indie movie apparently. Id been looking forward to it for months.<br /><br />How can I put it this simply? It sucked in a very big way. An exercise in cinematic lameness that makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius.<br /><br />At best it was mildly amusing and at worst coma inducing. An amerterish script badly directed and shoddily edited into a ramshackle mess.<br /><br />And what was with the music being 500db louder than the rest of the sound track? That was about the only truly odd thing about it.<br /><br />If you want to see a genuinely funny bizarre movie involving aliens then try Repoman. There is no comparison!',neg
'This movie has more goofs than any other movie I have seen in my life. The special effects are damned terrible. For instance near the end when the Concorde is falling after the cargo door tears off the thing spins like a toy. The special effects of Airport (1970) are way better than this crap. Also the force of a Concorde opening up at altitude and speed would essentially turn the thing inside-out. (That is if it would even open at all) But the movie has its good points. Mostly when it ends. Thats also cheesy. E.g. The Thing lands on a bank of loosely-packed snow if it did that it would splinter into a million pieces. Overall 2 out of 10. Instant flop. Great laugh flick.',neg
'Any of Law & Orders CSI (take your choice of city) and Homicide: Life on the Streets weakest episodes is superior to the strongest episode of Bones.<br /><br />David Boreanaz is stuck in crappy Angel mode and Emily Deschanel portrays Bones too... unrealistically. The actors as a whole have terrible scenes together be it with forced acting or just awful lines.<br /><br />The murders become predictable after a while as the foreshadowing and clues are just too obvious.<br /><br />Music is okay though really unnecessary at times.<br /><br />All in all Bones is hardly the show Id recommend watching during the weekdays as it is a carbon-copy of better shows with unreal characters and ever-dulling stories.<br /><br />Skip this if you can.',neg
'George Lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesnt. But this show is a work of art. Its not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it (and jokes that re memorable at that). This show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old short drunk to an dyslexic teenager. I dont know who writes this show but that person does a great job. If they had just continued the show Im sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good traditional comedy then George Lopez is the show for you! The one bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air being Will Smith. Cmon man! But otherwise this show is genius! 10/10',pos
'People dont seem to be giving Lensman enough credit where its due. A few issues have been overlooked which are key to understanding the Lensman experience.<br /><br />The Year: For the year it was made in (1984) Lensman features some of the most stunning effects Ive ever seen. As a person who watches a lot of early 80s animation Lensman is unique in its use of what appears to be computer-generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive. Kims battle against the geometric cutter pods in the laser maze can be taken as an excellent example of this. Every time I watch that I have to keep repeating to myself that it was 1984 when it was made.<br /><br />The Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks that Ive heard and this mad hysterical beat permeates every corner of the film. Lensman borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and managed to somewhat deal with the first one - the need to fill in every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine. While the music is attuned well and galvanizes scenes such as the motorcycle battle in the Thionite Factory on Radelyx the heroine theme fails due to the sheer annoyance value of Chris. Its interesting to note that the constant music thwarted my attempts at noise removal when I was archiving lensman over from analog tape to digital format - since there wasnt a single second of silence available to use as a reference point.<br /><br />Western Influences: Helmut - sounds like helmet and has roughly the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the princess of SW and her name sounds suspiciously similar to Marissa Fairborn of Transformers. Takes over Han Solos role by flying the ship and having some technical expertise. Buzzkirk - a definite improvement on Chewbaka. The lens - a nice concrete copy of the force that comes across less as a chance to preach Christianity at the audience than in the original SW. While the force relied on belief far more than concentration the lens is a pure concentration tool. Theoretically anyone could wield the lens. The lens is far more limited than the Force - being purely a defensive/offensive weapon.<br /><br />Technology: The boskone alliance have interesting meatball sponge ships. They look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of white. The idea of a DNA weapon was nice if only it had been developed. The Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers (or whatever it was called - that 60s series where they were battling the Xylons). There werent enough ship to ship battles for me - this is much improved upon in the second Lensman film.<br /><br />Finally a note on Worzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character-design who fortunately continues on to the second film.<br /><br />',pos
'Heres yet another movie with dysfunctional lead characters who are totally amoral and yet were supposed to root for them? Not me. No character in this film was worth a damn.<br /><br />Robin Williams plays car salesman Joey OBrien. The man has no class a loser in every moral sense and a guy who thinks he can talk his way out of anything. Knowing Williams ability to talk he was good for this role. The women in his life are driving him loony too. Some of them arent much better than him.<br /><br />Tim Robbins plays a similar low-life who starts the take over the film when he fully loaded with explosives crashes into a car dealership showroom and holds people including his wife hostage. Robbins as in normal for him plays a disturbed and ridiculous character. I guess these nut-case roles come easily to these two actors. Gee I wonder why.<br /><br />There is so much yelling and screaming in this the movie that it will give you a headache. Combine those two screamers with the nasal voice of Fran Drescher and you really have an annoying over-the-top cast. This is like listening to chalk on a blackboard for an hour-and- a-half. This is comedy? No this is lame. <br /><br />In fact for a Robin Williams film to only have a dozen reviews posted here tells you something. Its a far cry from his best movie.',neg
'Obvious tailored vehicle for Ryan Philippe. It seem the studios were hoping he could play a lead tough cop and not look like hes eternally 16 (he cant).<br /><br />Heavyweights Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve as bookends to Phillippe but when theyre not on the screen Phillippe flounders; his shallow acting style has nothing to bounce off of.<br /><br />The script is a typical late 20th century potboiler good cop/bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue lifted out of 1970s TV cop shows such as The Streets of San Francisco. Snipes reprises his role as the eternal black-hat villain playing a slightly less crazed madman than his Demolition Man role. However there wasnt much for Snipes and Statham to chew on. Stathams character announces hed given up nicotine and caffeine - something this movie badly needed injections of.<br /><br />Truly forgettable moment: Ryan Phillippe expounding on Buddhist dogma: Galloway: Are you a Buddhist? Dekker: No. Its just something I picked up along the way.',neg

'The revelation here is Lana Turners dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.<br /><br />So viewers take notice! Here MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet and were therefore consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.<br /><br />In Two Girls on Broadway however she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number My Wonderful One Lets Dance. This number is conceived and filmed as a sort of hybrid between a Busby Berkely style extravaganza and the sort of routines Hermes Pan was designing for Astaire and Rogers at RKO.<br /><br />Thus the number opens with George Murphy and Miss Turner depicted as bar patrons (with full chorus) before a curtain of black lame wherein Mr. Murphy croons the number to Miss Turner. Then the camera (on a boom) pulls backward in a remarkable crane shot to reveal an enormous stage and a rotating set equipped with steps columns enclosures and sliding walls.<br /><br />From this point on Murphy and Turner execute a fast stepping variety of moods and attitudes including lifts spins soft shoe and ending with an electrifying series of conjoined pirouettes that concludes with Murphy both lifting and rotating Turner with thrilling speed to a racing orchestra.<br /><br />All told a dizzying feat that proves Miss Turner was fully capable of more than holding her own as a dancer though I daresay most of her admirers would balk at relinquishing her from her throne as the queen of melodrama.',pos
'This show was incredible but too esoteric for most people. If you had never truly seen a European variety show in the 70s or 80s (or at least a Mexican one) the entire show would probably be lost on you. If you had this show was a dead on skewering satire of the phony spectacle and shallowness that these shows dive into at their worst. Helmed by a chain-smoking suave wannabe with a pencil moustache and his ultra-glamorous and immasculating harridan of an EX-wife Viva Variety is a variety show that tries to get off the ground every episode but always descends into in-fighting and acts gone very wrong. The hosts are joined by Johnny Bluejeans a dim witted side-kick who seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means the kids will like him which of course they dont.<br /><br />The result was a hilarious spoof of variety shows in general. Imagine the arguing that probably happened BACKSTAGE during the last days of the Sonny & Cher Show. Now imagine its happening ONSTAGE in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their composure. Now add cheesy acts and a Euro-riche mentality (tuxedoes gowns booze accents and smokes). NOW you have Viva Variety.<br /><br />Have you ever heard a musician whose music was pretty much written for other musicians? Too conceptual? Viva Variety did this for comedians. WAY too esoteric for the standard American audience. It was funny as Hell. And doomed.',pos
'Curiosity led me to this masterpiece. Unfortunately I didnt rent it I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this film is that its not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin good! And with all the flash-backs and flash-forwards I had trouble following the story. All in all Jeremy Renners performance wasnt too bad. You can catch him in S.W.A.T. in which he plays a disgruntled ex-cop. Anyway I would rate this as a 1/10. It only got a 1 because of Renners so-so performance. There are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering Dahmers crimes. Avoid this one.',neg
'Well Ive just seen Buster Keatons film debut in Fatty Arbuckles The Butcher Boy and-despite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason-I found plenty to laugh at. Like when Buster orders molasses from butcher boy Fatty Fatty makes Buster come back to pay Buster says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses Fatty dumps molasses in Busters hat and takes money Buster takes hat back on head as it gets stuck Fatty attempts to remove it while molasses fall to floor Busters feet are now stuck on floor and so on. That probably didnt read funny but on screen it was hilarious as were some more slapstick involving flour being thrown and a later sequence that takes place in Fattys girlfriends boarding school with Fatty dressed in drag and Buster helping Fattys rival also in drag. Like I said many scenes dont make a lick of sense but the visuals especially those involving Arbuckle and Keaton are laugh inducing even today. Recommended viewing for Keaton completists.',pos
'This movie was definitely not one of Mary-Kate and Ashleys best movies. I really didnt like it and I was kind of disappointed in that movie. For some reason it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast. In some parts it got so boring that I had to fast forward it. It didnt have any bloopers or any exciting parts like their other movies.',neg
'Man on Fire was hot. I love a classic tale of good ol revenge and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl.<br /><br />The writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive Creasy had to rescue Pita. It was also good that Creasy wasnt a choir boy type trying to rescue Pita through the proper channels but instead used torture tactics and street smarts. Some may say Torture is wrong regardless and you may be right but when you see the pain Creasy goes through due to the loss of Pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back you cant help but side with Creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that.<br /><br />Creasys quest ended with the return of Pita to her mother and Creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys. But Creasys death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie it in fact enhanced it by showing that Creasy was willing to die to get Pita back. His death was noble in fact.<br /><br />Denzel does an excellent job as do the writers. This movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie.',pos
'This film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in Cow Dung Collehe the President was going to immediately change all US foreign policy.<br /><br />The worst thing is that while dangerous the concept of a policy based on if the USSR and US went to war it could mean the end of the world WORKED. The US and USSR NEVER WENT TO WAR.<br /><br />Had we only conventional weapons the notion of yet another war a win-able war in Europe and Asia was not unthinkable.<br /><br />Not that I think they should get rid of this movie. It should be seen by film students as a splendid example of How NOT to make a film.<br /><br />It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes...',neg
'This movie offers NOTHING to anyone. It doesnt succeed on ANY level. The acting is horrible dull long-winded dribble. They obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for. Complete garbage I cant believe what a laughable movie this was. <br /><br />And Im very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit a wowing NC-17 movie. The problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teens. Pathetic.',neg
'Michael Kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as Eric Seaver a troubled young man who was horribly mistreated as a little boy by his monstrous abusive alcoholic stepfather Barry (a genuinely frightening portrayal by Gunnar Hansen).

'After watching AwakeI led to a conclusion:director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of laughing at the spectatorfor the simple fact the movie is full of ridiculous elements.Awake has a lot of plot holes and it is full of absurd and ridiculous elements(for examplethe hospital uniform the spirit of the main character uses...did the ghost of a doctor leave it in the floor ?).The concept behind this movie is slightly ingenious but all the plot holes and the absurd things make of this a stupid and crappy film.With the exception of the great Lena Olinall the actors bring bad performances.Hayden Christensen has zero expressions and the same applies for Jessica Alba.The extraordinary actor Terrence Howard is enormously wasted on his role.Awake makes a laugh of the spectator.Its so ridiculous and full of absurd things that its impossible to take it seriously.My recommendation is:skip this crappy movie.',neg
'The movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly our main actress Orked was seen in a Chinese Language class. Later in the film she was asked on why (by Mukhsin) that she was sent to learn Mandarin. Her answer was simple for a child she is; coz shes already known the Malay Language well.<br /><br />Its a bit of a romance one may thought of it but once youve stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it youll notice the typical elements of Malaysia. The movie basically focuses on 10 year old Orked who met 12 year old Mukhsin in a game of which many would think of it as a boys game. Running out of players Mukhsin (who was new in that village) was forced to allow Orked into the game in which she eagerly showed the male side of her. Orked is no such ordinary girl as she depicts more of the male behavior as you will see in the movie defending Mukhsin from much violent encounter with her school-bullies throwing one of the bullys bag out from the school bus window throwing punches and kicks on Mukhsins brother where after he teased Mukhsin and so on and so forth. Both were awesome buddies and stick closer than that but with a slightest of misunderstanding in which most of us would all respond to in the same way parted the both of them until the day when Mukhsin left town.<br /><br />Now the movie depicts the first love between Orked and Mukhsin they started out as friends but slowly evolving into somewhat more of a closer relationship and then towards BGR. You would notice the changes Yasmin made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love. The different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor. The scenes were all in random but it depicted so much reality in it that youd be stuck on the screen for a long time. You will love the movie for what it is and not because that you want to be patriotic to the local scenes coz it means much more.<br /><br />As the movie envelopes around the two love birds it also manages to find its lens towards Orkeds parents her mother who was educated in England speaks very good English and in which her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of English which was humor all the way indeed. Let me just explain to you why humor can be such a prominent thing in this movie. And that explanation or description that you may portray can be given in only one word and that is RANDOMNESS. Often more than not we dont learn to laugh at ourselves and when we do we do it at the expense of others. It is just like what the movie Just Follow Law by Jack Neo would have mentioned - Often when we are ourselves we dont see the person in us we are but when only when we are in another persons body then only would we learn to see who we really are. And that is how humor applies as well more so than just dignity.<br /><br />The movie was filled with such randomness that the typical facts of our routine lives as we carried it out could be all the way filled with laughter if we want it to be.<br /><br />The other focus of this movie was on how Orkeds neighbor a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife and wanted to find another. Pak Koboi as what hes nicked after was seen polishing his motorbike daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend. The producer did not fail to show you perhaps why the husband wanted to find another wife. The wife was a real hurler or KPC as we Chinese would call it having interrupting on other peoples business and sending her own daughter to tease Orked in words only adults would use. After all what goes around comes around and thats probably why bad things kinda want to happen to her. In every time being nice to people around you wont hurt at all unless you have an ego to protect but then again whats it worth? The movie also centers around Mukhsins brother Hussein who would go out to town everyday until very late at night smoking drinking and also finding girls. Hes the total opposite of Mukhsin but thats all perhaps because of family problems. Both the brothers were staying with their aunt and the parents were far away from them. I will not reveal more of the story line as it would spoil much of the interest in wanting to find it out for yourself but the slightest of all elements in which the producer wanted to send a message across to the viewers is the life of us all. She wanted us me at least to view life from our own perspective when we are not ourselves. Movies in a way take us out from our own body places us in the characters position and use our empty mind then to view on the happenings of it. Depending on the type and genre of the movie you will be mesmerized by how a good movie such as this would portray and imply a significant impact on you.',pos
'This is one of the best movies out there and thats saying a lot being that it was for television. I really wish it was on d.v.d.<br /><br />Helen Hunt gave such a raw performance. She played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly. When she falls apart because he kills another kid it was amazing. She is so alone so he gets to her. When she talks about her mother! WOW!<br /><br />Steven Weber as the serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. It was Oscar-worthy. When he talks about killing the kids scary! When he realizes who she really is! What a scene!!<br /><br />They really dont make them like that anymore. It was a real thriller without being gory.',pos
'Well for starters this actually was THE most elegant Clausen film to this date.<br /><br />The mans always got a sense for characters with a slice of humor to them but I think that he in this movie adds a dimension unparrallel to anything hes made earlier. His work has - in very black n white words - been accepted by the broad but not that critical audience and weve always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to say.<br /><br />In Villa Paranoia however for the first time he surprises with an unseen wisdom and a respect for the minorities. Not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget. Set in Jutland - in the country - it deals with the everlasting issue of lack of love but in a close and at times brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused. And on top of that he himself manages to play a b******d! A true b*****d who wants the right thing but has no clue how to get there and people therefore suffer. Bitterly.<br /><br /> Id have to say its one of the best movies Ive seen this year and Im greatly anticipating his next.',pos
'By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over as films were moving in a different direction comedically and otherwise. With television looming on the horizon Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time. Where one wonders would movies have gone had television not come along or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years? Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed.<br /><br />Ad man Jim Blandings along with his wife and two daughters are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs. So he buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications. Well almost. Had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind. Then again he might not have. You decide. On this frail premise a wonderful film results full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning ones own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one. Nothing comes easy in this life as Mr. Blandings learns; but one neednt be miserable just because things dont always go ones way. There is after all the long run. But Blandings asks himself every few minutes how long is long?<br /><br />This movie is a delight. It is not I suppose a masterpiece in the Capra-McCarey tradition but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically. There is real warmth in the picture and a good deal of (W.C.) Fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically but not so much as to leave a bad taste. The people in the film are all very smart and affluent but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class.<br /><br />Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs. Blandings to perfection; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend who often has to bring up unpleasant topics such as how the real world works. There is too a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place. These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut. In a few short years things would change as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns which soon would be connected by highways littered with bottles and cans their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city.',pos
'The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was so closely modeled after Alan Quartermain (or at least is an Alan Quartermain TYPE of character) that the 85 director made the mistake of plundering the IJ movies for dialog and story far too deeply. What you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name Alan Quartermain in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated IJ saga (with a touch of Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /><br />It was labeled by many critics to have been a great parody or unintentional comedy. Unintentional is the word. This movie was never intended to be humorous; witty yes but not humorous. Unfortunately its witless rather than witty.<br /><br />With this new M4TV mini-series you get much more story character development of your lead solid portrayals and a fine even entertaining blend. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and Eye Candy. While it features both action and Eye Candy it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting IJ all together and going back to the source materials for AQ making for a fine well - thought - out plot and some nice complementing sub-plots. <br /><br />Now this attempt is not the all out action-extravaganza that is Indiana Jones. Nor is it a poor attempt to be so. This vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the AQ/KSM saga. Filmed on location in South Africa the audience is granted beautiful (if desolate) vistas SA aboriginal cultures and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here.<br /><br />Steve Boyum totally surprised me with this one as I have never been one to subscribe to his vision. In fact I have disliked most of his work as a director until this attempt. I hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be. <br /><br />This version rates a 9.8/10 on the TV scale from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.',pos
'Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie but I resisted. I dont know what Ridley Scott intended but I learned that in the army women get as stupid as men. They learn to spit to insult and to fight in combat and thats also a waste of time (in my opinion). And anyway what the hell was that final scene in Lybia? Are they still fighting Gadafi or is it that its easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger?',neg
'This movie was horrendous it was sorta like accidentally watching a gay porn waiting for the girls but they just dont come....I waited for almost 2 hours for the damn scarecrows....they just dont come...instead its just some dumb ass wandering through a dead cornfield with a camera its a mix of Blaire witch and some bad episode of the twilight zone. And the best part is that as of October 23 2005 they started filming a sequel please dont be fooled by the box even though it looks exactly the same as the first dark harvest its not lions gate bought the rights to the Maize:the movie and had the brilliant idea to release it as the sequel to the original dark harvest;which i thought was funny........the only thing they had in common was they were both shot in a cornfield....This Movie WILLLLLL not scare the crop out of you like the first one so just stay away!!!!!',neg
'I really liked this movie and went back to see it two times more within a week.<br /><br />Ms. Detmers nailed the performance - she was like a hungry cat on the prowl toying with her prey. She lashes out in rage and lust taking a too young lover and crashing hundreds of her terrorist fiancés mothers pieces of fine china to the floor. <br /><br />The film was full of beautiful touches. The Maserati the wonderful wardrobe the flower boxes along the rooftops. I particularly enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the recitation of Antigone.<br /><br />It had a feeling of Story of O - that is where people of means indulge in unrestrained sexual adventure. As she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff she is at ease - and why not what is to restrain a Devil in the Flesh?<br /><br />The whole movie is a real treat!',pos
'Just came back from the first showing of Basic Instinct 2. I was going into it thinking it would be crappy based on preview critics and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Basic Instinct I think you will enjoy #2 just as much if not more. Great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking. The music is superb reprising the originals theme. Dont go expecting Academy Award material go to see it for enjoyment and fun. Thats what movies are designed for -- escapism. I cant think of a better way to escape than to escape with Sharon Stone who is as sexy as she ever was. Am thinking about going to see it again this weekend. Go see it!',pos
'The title of this documentary is very misleading. At no time during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the Nile Perch fish into Lake Victoria has cause any of the problems facing the town of Mwanza Tanzania. The film tries to place the problems of Tanzania on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a parasitic outside force. The documentary is very slowing paced with no narrative what so ever. Instead it relies on small blips of text between none related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand of the subject matter. There are only two attempts to discus the environmental effects of the Nile Perch fish. One is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the Nile Perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species. The film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it. The second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact the Nile Perch has introduced and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become. <br /><br />The subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the Perch fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most African countries. The film tries to link the introduction of the Perch fish with AIDS Poverty and Pollution in Tanzania but never makes a direct connection. As any intelligent person well read with problems in Africa the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with the fish. It would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish but they dont. The fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many. Yes things are BAD within the town of Mwanza but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter.<br /><br />A weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to famine problems in Tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First off Tanzania is a very large country and Lake Victoria is only a small portion of the country. Many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to Mwanza the fishing town on the lake to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country. <br /><br />This documentary is very weak has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the Nile Perch. It plays on peoples emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty famine and AIDS making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the Lake Victoria region of Tanzania or directly related to the Perch Fish. The fact is most of the problems have more to do with War Globalization and Christianity than and environmental effect of the Perch fish itself.',neg

Aina the Zeon officer and Shiro the Federal Forces new pilot meet in a battle in space throughout the 12 episode series (and one movie) the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that surrounds them. It features a Romeo and Juliet romance and unbeatable animation. By far one of the best to hit American Shores. Suit Up!',pos
'This movie is one of the most memorable films I have seen. I went reluctantly with a Turkish friend who recommended it. I am not a very enthusiastic proponent of music documentaries but when Aynur Dogan a Kurdish woman banned for years from singing in Turkey sings her piece the theater was in awe. I would give my all to hear a CD recording of this haunting gorgeous song. And she is just one of many artist interviewed and recorded speaking of their experiences of performing in Istanbul. Even now a month later I remember the footage of Aynur singing in an acoustic auditorium and I try to remember the music as it echoed in the cinema. Well done to Faith Akin the director of this film and his great idea to capture the many splendid sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. It would certainly encourage me to visit Istanbul.',pos
'Baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies. The script the music just about everything in this movie is a waste of time.<br /><br />The sound FX do not sound real they stick out way too much (technical gadgets etc.) If they are trying to make a movie about things like this at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps because those gadgets dont really make loud sounds like that. Natural sounds like footsteps and such are non-existent which gives it a void-like atmosphere.<br /><br />Directing seems to be OK for such a low budget film (I sure hope it was a low budget production) although it does seem fairly amateurish at times.<br /><br />Most characters seem empty and false they simply havent casted this movie very well. Id imagine it wouldve been a better idea to make Baldwin speak some Spanish than to make Spanish actors speak English when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used. I mean could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak English with a bad accent? Its shouldve a long ago buried corpse in movie production. The production team ever heard of subtitles? This movie again manages to depict European police as lazy and corrupt the societies as vulnerable and helpless. I mean if the plot again goes like The Interpol cant do jack so lets call one American to bring down this international syndicate or whatever.<br /><br />Sony Pictures treads on the same path as Columbia before it just producing movies for the hell of it. Id imagine them to have some self respect also. Are buyers supposed to buy every dirty title just because Sony puts out something good a few times a year?! Maybe they shouldve used the same team as who were making Di Que Si - Say I Do. Its spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job keeping the movie afloat. Looks and sounds much better! Come on Sony wake up produce less sell more.',neg
'After the lush inspiring aerial shot in fast motion in the opening of the movie this slipped into utter boredom and a one tone note right till the end.<br /><br />Where to begin well Ill start with the characters. I really enjoyed them in the book here they all were types and one dimensional morons that either had Victim or Asshole written on their foreheads from the get go. How any one didnt see through the store owner Lealand Gaunt (in a hammy and out of place performance by Sydrow)is beyond me.<br /><br />This film lacks in thrills suspense and in some sense yes entertaining values. It stretches itself for far too long with not a lot of pay off. Why introduce too many annoying should-die-quick type of characters and then forget about half of them half way through? In the book practically everyone that went into the store met a grisly fate. Here besides one of the only decent scenes that translated well from the novel (the fight between Wilma and Nettie) was a letdown and didnt have much balls. Im sorry but after one off screen deatha boring shoot off and some bickering and then a couple explosions just didnt do it for me. The brutality and mean spiritedness from the book was sadly missing. The explosion of the church scene was so over the top and badly executed all of sudden the entire city was in a brawl? It made no sense and characters that werent introduced all the way through suddenly are who are these people and why should I care?<br /><br />The story is all over the place and none of the scenes had momentum. I thought Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good actors in this but the movie gives them not enough substance for me to give a damn. Amanda Plummer was credible but too pathetic to really be sympathetic (in the novel she was a sad and depressing character)here it was a too one note. J.T. Walsh was entertaining but the role was far from interesting or layered. Too predictable. <br /><br />The soundtrack was too classy for the material it was supporting. It stood out like sore thumb. Easy there buddy easy. Something a little less theatrical Id assume would have worked.<br /><br />I will admit some of the gore it did manage to have was good enough I guess The director seemed to hold back a lot of the times though. If your going to make a movie that reaches the 2 hr point be sure to have far more going on then this disaster of a adaption of on of Kings better novels.<br /><br />I often found myself laughing at scenes that were suppose to be taken seriously (Ed Harris speech at the end or the character Hugh Priest in general) and was bored and uninterested most of the other time. Personally the director should have done so much more with this story his approach is too tame and hides behind too much crisp cinematography to ever come off as a decent movie. The movie looks good but not the look I think this story deserved. I mean this dude helmed ALASKAnot a good sign. <br /><br />Id rather just read the book as you should too as if it is far more entertaininglayered character development grisly violence and mayhem a nasty sense of humour and far more oomph. This is a butchered version that has not much to offer. <br /><br />** out of ****',neg
'Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps colonel who musters a handful of private Vietnam vets to go back to Laos and rescue some Americans who have been listed as missing in action. Hackman suspects that in actuality the half-dozen or so MIAs are secretly being held in a remote camp by Laotians to be tormented and to provide more hard labor. Hackman is being paid by the wealthy Robert Stack whose son like Hackmans son is thought to be among the MIAs. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can only manage to buy old and out-dated weapons though he manages to pick up the help of a fervid anti-communist Loatian and his two daughters along the way.<br /><br />I dont think the movie was deliberately concocted to endorse the myth of the Vietnames still holding our MIAs for propaganda purposes. The myth was real enough. If anyone remembers there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983 BRING BACK THE MIAs. I think instead that the film was made partly in order to cash in on the myth. It was absurd on the face of it. Why would our former enemy refuse to return MIAs? Propaganda? Where is the propaganda value in something thats kept secret? To add the labor supply? They need a hundred extra laborers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives behind this movie -- with its triumphant music and high body count -- were scurrilous.<br /><br />But how about the movie itself? Stripped of its theme of rescuing mythical mistreated MIAs its a routine paramilitary actioner no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackmans performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water. Hes just about always reliable.<br /><br />Of the others this being a formulaic plot derived from The Dirty Dozen among others I kept trying to guess which of the gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission. Of the three anti-communist Asians I figured one or more were dead meat. Thats why Asian helpers appear in movies like this. (I was right two times out of three.) I also figured Patrick Swayzie as the rookie ex-officer the youngest of the group whod never earned the respect of the others because hed never seen combat would also have to go in some heroic mode. Wrong. He becomes a hero true but survives intact. I thought there was a fifty-fifty chance that Hackman would have to go too but he makes it out okay. The formula doesnt really stretch for originality either. Charles Bronsons claustrophobic POW escapee from The Great Escape is here in Fred Wards ex tunnel rat a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside it so that he can do a recon on the Laotian POW camp.<br /><br />The title Uncommon Valor is from a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to the men on Iwo Jima -- Uncommon valor was common that day. Nimitz was certainly right about that. Whether or not the men who fought in Vietnam were all equally valorous is remote from the point. Anyone who saw combat or even came near it putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them were heroic enough. This movie and the way it exploits our bitterness about the Vietnam war doesnt really do them justice.',neg
'Except people apparently buy into this garbage! As shows like Moral Orel have shown even if you tried to make the most outrageous over-the-top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of it wouldnt come close to the hilarity of this show. Its hard to tell whats even going on when youre watching it. Is it a news show? A talk show? Who knows!? They start out by reporting on various international news stories but at seemingly random points the news is interrupted by this odd troll-like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy.<br /><br />Pat Robertson doesnt even seem like such a bad guy at first glance. He just seems like a senile yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who has called for an assassination who has befriended and offered aid to not one but TWO murderous dictators who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines who has SUPPORTED forced abortions in China and who regularly implies that Caucasians (straight American male Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races.<br /><br />Still this would all be funny except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later (either that or enough money to bribe some TV executives who dont give a damn what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people somewhere must be watching it and hanging onto every word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is people still listen to him. I dont know if its funny or scary. I guess a healthy mixture of both.',neg
'Until today I had never seen this film. Its was filmed on the sets of the Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers.<br /><br />Frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that wont quit Lionel Atwill Dwight Frye Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas playing a character named Brettschnieder which is of interest to me since that was my great grandmothers maiden name.<br /><br />This is a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time only going astray when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up. From that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that preceded it.<br /><br />Leonard Maltin and IMDb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints. The trouble is that IMDb and Maltin can be wrong and in this case I think they are since a source I trust more says the full running time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia) Quibbling about this I know is insane but since most prints that are available tend to run around 60-63 minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only 67 minutes long. Personally I think it wont matter that much since its at most five minutes and I doubt very much it will make or break the film.<br /><br />What ever the running time  if you like creaky old films do by all means do watch this movie its a great dark and stormy night film.',pos
'The novelty of hearing clean-cut Jay Leno spout four-letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched-police-partners caper. In COLLISION COURSE the pelican-faced comedian teams up with the late Pat Morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger (think car lover Leno played a hand in the plot?). The two leads try hard they really do but Leno is no actor and Moritas fish-out-of-water routine gets old in a hurry. The film carries a bit of cheesy 80s appeal but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong 100-minute running time. Fans of Lenos considerable comedic talents will feel let down; everyone else will just be bored.',neg
'Many people are making fun out of Steven Seagals acting abilities. And I really see why if I remember Fire Down Below. Well...ok his other films are acceptable (regarding to his acting!). <br /><br />After reading reviews about The Patriot I didnt expect anything from this film. I barely came through Fire Down Below and I read a lot that The Patriot was even worse. So I was really surprised about this one. In my opinion it is one of his very best movies. If it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be THE best. I liked the story the directing and the actors. Cammilla Belle was just incredible. She will have a great movie-career in the future. The few action scenes were very well made. And Steven Seagal was very believable in his unusual role.',pos
'I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films. It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained as well as their beauty. It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate. Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edies voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Unforgettable.',pos
'I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school. I thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles. I think the type of people that wouldnt like this movie would be those who dont like solving things or those who get frustrated when they cant solve riddles. its a good movie based on a true story that happened in my home town of Toronto Ontario. so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there watch this movie. And for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws realize that in real life this same stuff does happen. but thats all I want to say on that. The riddles are good some are hard some are not. But the movie also leaves you wanting more more riddles more explanation just plainly more. Something more I want to add is that the ideas within this movie the underground riddle world does exist but there is a lot more to it. To find it you can not look for it. To never look for it would be no way to find it. Leave your mark and it will find you.',pos
'Saw this on cable back in the early 90s and loved it. Never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently. Still find it a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why its not higher rated. I found everything about this film compelling. As a vet (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations brought by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in Iraq. I wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see. The human toll on our soldiers isnt left on the battlefield. Its brought home for the rest of there lives. And this film is one of many that brings that home in a very hard way. Excellent film.',pos
'New York I Love You finally makes it to our shores but its 10 short stories on love somehow didnt find reason enough to be released over Valentines probably due to the fact that this years festival also falls on Lunar New Year and with that comes the usual LNY blockbuster films from the likes of Jackie Chan (no not The Spy Next Door) and local filmmaker Jack Neo who has traditionally released his latest film over that period to resounding success. So why fix a formula that hasnt been broken?<br /><br />Continuing in concept where Paris Je Taime had begun in spawning the City of Love Franchise (Shanghai will be next so says the end of the closing credits here) the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme although someone probably forgot to tell Scarlett Johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else (well it was shot in black and white) but heres hoping that it would make it to the DVD at least.<br /><br />Structurally this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created. Here a little more leeway is given where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise though already seen in Paris.<br /><br />One of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one is definitely the creative forces behind the stories from writers directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city coming together for a concept film. And what more the star-studded cast too with big names amongst the lesser known ones all upping the ante through picture perfect performances be it for the entire length of the short or as a support to build upon. You cant deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables from Irrfan Khan to Natalie Portman (who also had writing and directing duties) Rachel Bilson (looking quite like Bardot) to Spielbergs blue eye boy Shia LaBeouf who surprisingly can act and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to date.<br /><br />Story wise like any anthology youll find some which will automatically appeal to you and with others that dont. Some are straightforward in nature while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked. But these 10 stories plus 1 (because Randall Balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks) somehow lacked the more anything goes spirit from its predecessor with stories more rooted in reality compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film (Elijah Woods dalliance with a vampire anyone?) or even less adventurous with its narrative style (Christopher Doyles and Tom Tykwers starring Natalie Portman). Here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment.<br /><br />Minor quibbles aside I still enjoyed almost all the shorts here contrary to what many others have felt about it. The short film format is still very much alive and having them strung together into a feature under the City of Love banner works fine and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its lineup. I am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here. We surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a Singapore I Love You so heres crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road. Otherwise theres always the Sawasdee Bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules.',pos

'The old dark house sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.<br /><br />The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonels own group The Sphinx Club is determined to protect him at all costs. This does not sit well with Thelma (Irene Purcell) fiancée of club member Brand Osborne (Ben Lyon late of the mega-budgeted HELLS ANGELS (1930)) who wants him to quit the club and stop endangering his own life. Brand promises to resign after saving the colonels life. Everyone heads off to Walters newly purchased mansion on Long Island to await the assassin.<br /><br />The Colonel might be the new owner of Melody Manor but its an old dark house complete with eccentric neighbours (like Raymond Hatton as a local hermit) and maybe even a ghost. Top billed Zasu Pitts is Nora the housekeeper who expects to see a spirit around every corner. Throw in a cop (James Gleason) who is certain Brand is a criminal and we have a picture which is packed with action and surprises.<br /><br />You will notice right away that the script writer was at a loss to come up with too much dialog because a lot of characters repeat the same lines over and over. Yoganda (C. Henry Gordon) a Hindu mystic (which movies of that time were loaded with) says Evil is on the way. many times and I lost count of how often Ms. Pitts says Something always happens to somebody!. There are many suspects and two characters (Mr. Gleason as the stereotype dumb cop and Roscoe Karns as Mr. Lyons pal) who serve as comedy relief. The house itself is appropriately spooky looking (in fact I think the same set was used in THE PHANTOM (1931)) with lots of secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms but somehow you never really get a feeling of danger. Maybe its because no one in the movie and I do mean no one! is entirely what they seem to be. It all comes out right in the end though; but to go into any more detail would spoil it for you.<br /><br />Watch carefully for Robert Frazer (from WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (best remembered as Capt. Engelhorn from KING KONG) to pop up among the suspects.<br /><br />THE CROOKED CIRCLE is a fun film. Some aspects of the plot are predictable and then again several others are not. I suspect you will enjoy it.',pos
'Why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others?

Of course there probably wouldnt be an X-Files if this show hadnt prepped this audience for it so well. Darren McGavin is not exactly the super-heroic type but he is a plausible(enough) guy to deliver heroic deeds. Check out his work on some of those old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here he is the main attraction there doesnt seem to be a girlfriend or wife whos a distraction. In fact there isnt a whole lot of sex appeal to the show. Something Im noticing as well is that the pacing isnt really suspenseful in a typical way. Theres a lot of throwaway humor to this show. Sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax. Theres a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present MAD MEN show in terms of style. Not that David Chase writes Mad Men but the people that worked under him on The Sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his serio-comic tone.',neg
'Ive enjoyed watching Lost from the beginning and endured a few bad actors in poorly written episodes because when Lost is good its really good! But this episode that features Mr Echos demise had so many drawn out scenes with lingering closeups of bad acting that I found myself tapping the fast forward button. This episode stood out so far as by far the worst. In fact the variation in quality of Lost has been so inconsistent I find myself often wondering how many writers they are using.<br /><br />I will continue to watch but hope things get better and hope I stop secretly wishing for the sub-par actors in the series to die off.',neg
'Some sciencey people go down in a cave for some reason and theres some sort of creature thats killing them.<br /><br />I usually give a more detailed plot but I wasnt paying too much attention to this. Overall it was dull and the only time youll be really paying attention is during the action scenes which the director did wonderful on.<br /><br />The acting is alright but the characters are so dull and forgettable they blend in your mind. Youll forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons: 1. The kills are boring 2. The characters are boring.<br /><br />The ending might have shocked me more if I knew who was who.<br /><br />So youre looking for a creatures-in-cave movie? Check out The Descent instead.',neg
'I am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on Stephen Kings books - this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable.<br /><br />I have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and I still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary.<br /><br />The scene where Gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out. And the No fair uttered by little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance.<br /><br />',pos

'Get Shorty was an excellent film. It was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comical acting and a serious plot. Be Cool is like some cheap knock-off trying to pass for a sequel. John Travolta as Chili Palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob. He plays it like hes a bored movie exec rather than a bored movie exec who used to be a Shylock. Uma Thurman great in nearly every role shes ever played comes off as strained and confusing. Is she supposed to be ditzy or clever? The chemistry between her and Travolta is strained and uncomfortable. Other than that just add every movie cliché you can think of. A well-educated rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer an inept gangster wannabe in Andre 3000 the girl with heart soul and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian a gimmicky black dude wannabe in Vince Vaughn and a stupid celebrity cameo by Stephen Tyler. The only funny part was the Rock who invents his own new cliché as a gay Samoan bodyguard actor wannabe. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: IT MAKES NO SENSE. Get Shorty was clever with Chili playing one group against another and coming out on top. But this film tries that with about a million different characters. And even Chili doesnt seem to know whats going on. Fans of Get Shorty be warned: this is a very different very worse movie.',neg
'What the movie The 60s really represents (to those of us who growled around in the belly of America in those times) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated stereotyped characters the genuineness of the issues remains clear.<br /><br />Not only were those radical times of change but also very confusing times. Two basic things changed our world then: the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the overwhelming influence of the media. Those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized.<br /><br />From chaos came sensitivity from disorder came values. Bear in mind however that the bulk of Americans were not involved in this... they worked they played they watched the news... and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities... the Civil Rights workers the Political Activists the Anti-War efforts the War on Poverty....<br /><br />The representation of the power of the press and TV in particular was well reflected although the conflict between the general publics attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored... and at worst misrepresented.. Middle class Americans werent all standing around angrily holding baseball bats or disowning their wayward daughters. They were confused too. Let us not forget how Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers and how The Beatles began an onslaught that killed the Folk-Protest Movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie or even any mention of them.<br /><br />I think if you didnt live the decade you might not have a sense of what the movie is about the overall picture is a bit dim. At one point I held down a steady job while my sister lived at the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. At another point I was in Haight Asbury and in the Detroit Riots while she worked and played the housewife in Maine and Connecticut. Roles were constantly changing.<br /><br />The movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family. They represent the hippie child the political activist and the active military personnel. Dad represents the typical attitudes and mom represents the voice of reason tolerance and sometimes compromise... for the sake of peace.<br /><br />The Black family comprises a minister and his son... disproportionately I think. I assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations or else the film would have become a long boring documentary. Dads message was that anger produces bitterness and bitterness produces chaos. It was clearly a message directed to todays youth.<br /><br />We are looking at a unique solution to social problems and also how issues divide us... The 60s were unusual in that way and only the Roaring 20s compare. In other words this movie has a moral after all. In the end it is our Collective Individualism that survives. Put that in your oxymoron list.<br /><br />Everyone was a God a Guru or a free-spirited genius in the 60s. It was a time of magic and madness. No one will ever nail the 60s down right... it was too diverse (this movie is close). At least we can say we are not ashamed of it that we learned and grew from it and that for once a generation shaped and changed America... for the better.',pos
'William Powells final outing as Philo Vance occurs in The Kennel Murder Case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind. Its all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why.<br /><br />The Philo Vance murders by S.S. Van Dine were most popular at the time and the clever Mr. Van Dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder. This is why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios putting them out. Had Bill Powell not gone on to greater fame with MGM as Nick Charles of the Thin Man series he would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vances. <br /><br />It turns out that Powell had entered his little terrier Captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim. As usual Powell shows up Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was found.<br /><br />I did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how. Powell has a lovely group of suspects as extensive as what normally is in a Thin Man mystery. People like Paul Cavanaugh Helen Vinson Ralph Morgan Mary Astor fill their cast roles well.<br /><br />Warner Brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the Thirties with James Stephenson in his one and only outing as Philo Vance. It doesnt hold a candle to this one.<br /><br />As this is the only Powell Philo Vance that is out on VHS or DVD by all means see this one or acquire it if you can.',pos

'Ive had never been disappointed by a Kurosawa film but this is probably the first. Doppelganger is the worst Ive seen from this director.<br /><br />Tartan Films is advertising this as The most frightening film yet from Kiyoshi Kurosawa. What? The most frightening film from Kurosawa is definitely Kairo. And if you think this is horror your in for a surprise. This cant be classified as horror or thriller. This is a drama and a pretty bad one at that. A lot of scenes that were meant to be shocking have turned out being funny and a lot of the plot is really confusing. And since its Kurosawa the pacing is slow. But its so slow that youll lose interest forty minutes in and feel like doing something else. The thing that annoyed me the most was the use of CGI. Now CGI if used well can be really cool. But if executed with little care... It can be a disaster. I think that describes one scene here that has a very minimal use of CGI.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can give Dopppelganger is that it has really good acting. Koji Yakusho gives a great performance along with the rest of the cast. But thats pretty much it...<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor and go watch Kairo or Ko-Rei if you want to be scared. This is a bad bad attempt at a smart drama. Which it is intelligent but... Well theres a lot missing.<br /><br />3/10 for the good acting.',neg

'One Night at McCools wants you to think it is a hip and clever black comedy. It pushes its quirky characters and outrageous situations at the viewer like a crack dealer making overtime. The premise is about a gold digging woman named Jewel who dates men to get them to steal and sometimes murder so she can have all the worldly possesions she so desperately desires. You know this wouldnt be a bad strategy if she chased after rich guys. This film really wants one to believe that a foxy con artist would waste time dating bartenders and Andrew Dice Clay. Please. That major flaw in Jewels scheme is really the only entertainment to found found in this stinker (and thats unintentional). Watching it it is not hard to believe there could have been a good movie inside it somewhere. One Night at McCools just could not decide what direction it wanted to take so just sat in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo. It tries to be sexy but no clothes are removed on camera and the few scenes of body head are dreadfully pedestrian. There is one recurring scene where a hitman is asking the protaganist (played by Matt Dillon) about how the sex is with Jewel. It seems like Matt doesnt know neither do the viewers. Why was he dating her anyway? One Night at Mccools also wants to be funny. Sorry bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings didnt even work on Threes Company. Whats worse is that this movie really seemed like it was going for a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy. Kind of like a sophomoric Coen brothers film but its shallow script could not play subtlety nor could its lackluster dirction sledgehammer in any shocks. What the audience is left with is a film that seems to busy trying to please everybody and just losing any appeal along the way.',neg
'Wow... 5 more hours of Riget. Lars continues the great combination of occult dark horror and soap-opera drama. Picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left off(complete with the same high intensity and suspense though that doesnt last; for better or worse) this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste... in the last series there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode whereas in this it clearly is one long stretch... where one episode ends the next begins. A lot can be said about Lars von Trier... but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric. Both qualities show in this. The plot continues its excellence now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention. Basically every character from the first returns at least as far as the main roles go. The pacing isnt as sharp as in the first part and I found myself less gripped by this one. That is not in any kind of way to say that this didnt involve me though... I still found myself constantly watching and at several points reacting strongly often out loud to what was going on(extremely unusual behavior for me as I am an incredibly silent person) as I also was during the first. Like the first this also brings up some loaded ethical questions. Building on the foundation from the first this brings the story further... and being a sequel the scope is also bigger. Grander. More spirits more bizarre occurrences more subplots. The strong graphic material of the first also returns and its been kicked up a notch. The characters are developed further. The acting is amazing as that of the first. Udo Kier solidifies his immense talent to anyone who doubted it. Playing a very difficult character(anyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what I mean) *and* acting in a language he didnt speak(he was later dubbed)... and still handing in such a strong performance. The cinematography remains great and is still very hand-held with rapid zooms and the occasional long take. The editing is sharp with a few direct cuts in sound(though these were more prominent in the first). Now with all that said I would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10... or at least just under like the first four episodes. I truly enjoyed watching and I dont regret it in the least. But this does have shortcomings... the ones the first part had and more. As the first the humor just takes up too much space... and this time around its even worse. There are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief... three of them no less. Scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh. Fine for a comedy but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant yes nothing short of sadistic at times horror piece? Helmers solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof... from which he could see his beloved Sweden... to a bathroom. With an angle from inside the bowl. No you read that right. In general the humor seems more low-brow... more sex and bodily function jokes which again begs the question Why?. Whilst most of the writing is excellent some of it is downright dire. Several scenes are basically copied from the first mini-series(one would guess due to their popularity when it aired). At times the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first and it jumps too much at times. Fortunately seldom but still noticeably plot points and items are explained away too easily(a certain character living in Denmark for no apparent reason for example... anyone whos seen it knows who Im speaking of). The two dishwashers while still mysterious and insightful become too much of a gimmick... too overexposed in the end I guess. Most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable though. In addition to that I want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things I have just written that this is still mostly good... definitely enjoyable compelling powerful... and in my humble opinion it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first(though if belong in that group; do not expect to feel that the story is finished after watching this any more than you did after the first). I recommend this to any fan of Lars von Trier and anyone who enjoyed the first Riget and wants more where that came from. I urge anyone whos even considering watching this to make sure youve seen all of the first before you do... I bought this before I bought the first but I held out on watching until I had bought the first and watched that and I cant tell you how glad I am that I did. Though this features a brief summary of the events in the first there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didnt see it before watching this. Slightly lesser sequel but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first. 8/10',pos

'A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novels characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didnt like at all though is that the main characters like Mandras and Pelagias father werent greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living but to me they didnt succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the films plot. Irene Papas was really great in her role a typical example of a mother living in a island during the 40s who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone. John Hurt Pelagias father also acted great. He reminded me a greek in many of his reactions.',pos
'This movie took the Jerry Springer approach to super-human power. Wilder Napalm is the kind of theme-based movie that I love addressing the idea that prodigies in America are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them. At the same time the movie points out that every prodigy is only human and no more to be feared or worshipped than any other human being. This was a great comedy fun and human with that slight satiric edge.',pos

The photo is OK but the rest is total crap. Dont see this horror movie go and see the Ring 2 or any other movie whos much more of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies. We have seen enough of that. The only good thing in the movie is when they are standing at a roof and shoot famous infected celebrities.',neg
'LE GRAND VOYAGE is a gentle miracle of a film a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director Ismaël Ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this road trip story and the sophisticated acting of the stars Nicolas Cazalé and Mohamed Majd to carry the emotional impact of the film. Ferroukhis vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of Katell Djian (a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters) and the musical score by Fowzi Guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys. <br /><br />Reda (Nicolas Cazalé) lives with his Muslim family in Southern France a young student with a Western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage. His elderly father (Mohamed Majd) has decided his time has come to make his Hadj to Mecca and being unable to drive requests the reluctant Reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation. The two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through France into Italy and on through Bulgaria Croatia Slovenia and Turkey to Saudi Arabia. Along the trip Reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and Reda is irritably left to struggle with his fathers demands. On their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman (Ghina Ognianova) who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by Reda a Turkish man Mustapha (Jacky Nercessian) who promises to guide the father/son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting Reda drunk in a bar and disappearing and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons. Tensions between father and son mount: Reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps and the father cannot comprehend Redas insensitivity to the fathers religious beliefs and needs. At last they reach Mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trips significance is overwhelming to Reda. The manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning. It has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age between son and father and between defiance and acceptance of religious values. <br /><br />The visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just happens to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects. Nicolas Cazalé is a superb actor (be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film The Grocers Son) and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film. Another fine film from The Film Movement this is a tender story brilliantly told. Highly recommended. <br /><br />Grady Harp',pos
'Despite the other comments listed here this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the countrys socio-political feelings during the Reagan glory years of the early 80s. Its also a kickass action movie.<br /><br />Opening with a liberal female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene which prompts the famous Go ahead make my day line) Sudden Impact is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film. The first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome Inspector Callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood. It gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for Callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past. Superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the 80s.',pos
'Ive expected a comedy about the NVA but this is a parody. It shows the national army of Eastern Germany in a light that is not appropriate and definitely not true.<br /><br />One can make a comedy about everything as long as the underlying facts are not changed. Even a comedy about the German KZ is possible as Roberto Benigni with LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL has shown.<br /><br />The movie NVA would be an OK comedy because the jokes in it are overall OK. Nothing special - not hilarious but enough to live with it.<br /><br />The point is that the movie makes a farce and a parody about the NVA. A death machine that was ready to attack WESTERN EUROPE along with its friend the RED ARMY. An institution that used everything to get the utmost from its soldiers. An army that marched into the CSPR in 1968 and was ready to march also in POLAND to destroy the SOLIDARNOSC. You cant make a movie without showing the tiniest bit of evil or would you make a parody about a KZGuantanamo or 9/11??? Showing Osama bin Laden as a funny screwed guy? 90 minutes about a funny Osama in a Afghan Taliban camp where he makes jokes and is training his soldiers would be comparable to what this movie is doing about the NVA!',neg
'Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke star in this controversial story of a wall street exec and an art gallery employee who hook up and begin a very experimental sexual relationship.While the acting by Rourke and Basinger is ok the flim doesnt allow their characters to truly form. Allegedly there was a lot of film left on the cutting room floor that delved deeper into the characters and the effects of the relationship on them - Basingers character considering suicide - that would have made the characters more involved for the viewer.

'Wimpy stuffed shirt Armand Louque (blandly played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls for the lovely Claire Duval (fetching blonde Dorothy Stone) who uses the meek sap to get Armands colleague Clifford Grayson (the hopelessly wooden Robert Noland) to marry her. Furious over being used and spurned by Claire Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. Sound exciting? Well it sure aint. For starters Victor Halperins static (non)direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace. Worse yet Halperin crucially fails to bring any tension atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings. The mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesnt help matters any; only George Cleveland as the hearty General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as the irascible Dr. Trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics. The drippy stock film library score the painfully obvious stagebound sets and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well. In fact this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can alleviate the brain-numbing boredom.

'Gus Van Sant has made some excellent films. I truly am a fan.<br /><br />However I cant help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins book Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is lost in translation to the big screen. Alone Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent. Ultimately though this one just didnt work. <br /><br />It wasnt that the characters werent well developed or the plot and content didnt come alive. Its just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this. Were taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the authors precision. Movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience.

'By all accounts this could have been an interesting film. Featuring a score by the mighty Cradle Of Filth starring their frontman Dani and being hyped up as the future of British horror I expected Alex Chandons gore fest to live up to the hype.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Everything about this film is either cliche or inept. The short story anthology setup was done to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. Admittedly the idea of the sick room did send a chill down my spine but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting.<br /><br />Chandon cannot write dialogue. Every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence (the typical cop on the edge formula. funny im sure ive seen that somewhere else before...) No Chandon you are not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. It sounds BAD. Add ludicrously OTT acting with very dodgy casting (dont get me wrong Dani Filth is a great singer and musician but actor he aint) and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing. Give me Bruce Campbell any day.<br /><br />The visual effects are on the whole poor with some atrocious CGI awful gore effects (for goodness sakes Peter Jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget) and editing filters that shriek OVER-USE! As for the often mistimed use of Cradle Of Filths score... man they should sue.<br /><br />The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience. too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects (eg: maniac zombie flesh eaters the beyond suspiria etc) rendering Cradle of Fear in my mind second-rate and obsolete.<br /><br />I hope Chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares.<br /><br />Better luck next time.',neg

'Algiers is not a classic it is a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko directed by Duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming Pepe Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience the Casbah and the characters in Algiers I recommend you dont even watch this movie and see Pepe le Moko instead for it is much more elaborate more beautifully filmed the lines are not clichéd and the characters adhere much more to reality. Furthermore the ending is so dramatic and key to Pepes character that youll find the Algiers version intolerable. Although Algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters. Plus the wardrobe is truly breath-taking in all scenes particularly Pepes in the last scene and Gabys (at all times) but also when shes on the boat. Frankly Algiers is cheap as far as imitations go.',neg
'My guide for the quality of the a movie is if Im still thinking about it after leaving the theater. Im still thinking about this one the next day which doesnt happen often.<br /><br />The scenery (a reasonable guess for 16th century Italy) costumes lighting cinematography are all excellent. It is a beautiful film visually.<br /><br />Characters can never rise above the script they must recite but these actors made the most of their material which is excellent. This is one of Shakespeares best plays which people will still enjoy another 400 years down the road. All of the principals were interesting and enjoyable.<br /><br />Those who say this is anti-semitic must be deaf and blind. If anything it is anti-Venitian-16th-century-Catholic. While Shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by the hurts he has suffered it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame.

'Very good point there : only an elite few (the upper classes) would both have access to the internet AND be able to communicate on an exclusively English speaking site such as the IMDb Some might think Internet Is not reality but this point of view really put media society and democracy at stake: You are probably right.. Even If there Is Internet cafes in Venezuela most Chavez supporters will not afford to even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb.<br /><br />Screw you faschist upper class rich right wing capitalist liberal intellectual surpressors ..

'I thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including Peter OToole Susannah York Michael Craig & Harry Andrews might be worth watching. Alas I was wrong. Utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both OToole and York overacting wildly. I watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about. Ive a feeling OToole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister (York). He is also barking mad. But apart from that your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />The film has no redeeming feature whatsoever. I can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary unimaginative stagy piffle. Clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director. Risible.',neg
'If you have read the book - do not set your hopes high if you have not - go read it and never watch the film. It is strange to learn that Toby Young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script (as he claims himself in the post script of the book). Because the film is very different from the book.<br /><br />What the film seems to be aiming at - taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it - it achieves with perfection. The film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had.<br /><br />You are better off not seeing it.',neg
'Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular the way Candice pronounces the words Puerto Rican is very funny as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie called Old Acquaintance starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along so because the movie is about female friendship that might have been a problem. Here the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supporting parts and are both excellent in particular Bochner who never got many decent parts in movies as far as I am concerned. George Cukor did not make another movie after this so this was a good one to go out on.',pos
'A very addictive series.I had not seen an exact combination among drama action suspense and Sci-fi never before. I am impressed every chapter. The screenplay is very intelligent i dont know how the creators invent all this amazing stories every character have a strange past troubles stormy relationships it gives to the show the human sense needed for creating intimate characters.<br /><br />The most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related among them: The numbers they have met before without knowing it and so on. The others enigmatic security system and the Darma initiative are elements that dont let us lose a chapter.<br /><br />Mr. JJ Abrams what did you think to create this amazing story?',pos
'I only bought this DVD because it was dirt cheap and it seemed interesting in its own special way (special meaning retarded). The movie turned out to be quite uninteresting - boring camera work nothing really driving the story and of course the acting is horrible. It wasnt even bad in a campy way - it was just plain bad. There are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its awkward and weak. All I could think about while watching this was that this could actually be a good movie if the script was given a major overhaul (if it were written by someone who actually understood drug culture) and if some decent actors were cast. I wouldnt recommend Weekend With the Babysitter unless if you plan on a career in film and want to learn what not to do in a movie.',neg
'I seem to remember a lot of hype about this movie when it came out but had avoided seeing it throughout the years. I wish Id waited longer. Maybe this movie was funny in 1988 I dont know. I was younger then but it didnt seem like the world was that different. Michelle Pfeiffer lovely as she is is never convincing. Mercedes Ruehl not only chews scenery but stuffs it in her cheeks like a gerbil to save for later. Dean Stockwell is about as convincing as a mob boss as James Gandolfini would be as principal dancer for the Bolshoi. And Matthew Modine demonstrated the most pronounced case of delayed puberty Ive ever seen. All in all its not bad enough to make you want to pluck out your eyes with a melon-baller but its not far off.',neg
'Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot Mulholland Dr. was rejected. The next year David Lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters. He did so - and created one of the greatest most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made.<br /><br />The film really doesnt have main characters but if there were main characters they would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a perky blonde whos staying in her aunts apartment while she auditions for parts in movies. She finds Rita in her aunts apartment and decides to help her. You see Ritas lost her memory. She has no clue who she is. She takes her name Rita from a Gilda poster in the bathroom. So the two set out to discover who Rita really is.<br /><br />David Lynch has been known for making some weird movies but this film is the definition of weird. Its bizarre nightmarish and absolute indescribable. Its like a dream captured on film. By the 100-minute point the film has become extremely confusing - but if youve been watching closely it will make perfect sense. Having watched the movie and then read an article on the Internet pointing out things in the film I now understand the movie completely.<br /><br />The acting is very good. Watts is terrific. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director facing problems with the local mob. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores. And the directing - hah! David Lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was.<br /><br />Is this your type of film? Well that depends. You should probably view more of Lynchs work before watching this movie. Youll need to be patient with the film and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues Lynch has left throughout the movie. For Lynch fans this is a dream come true.<br /><br />Mulholland Dr. is a masterpiece. Its brilliant enigmatic and masterfully filmed. I love it.',pos
'After reading the book which had a lot of meaning for me the movie didnt give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed. This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.Either that or he is simply bad. Most importantly where is the lightness?! From the very first scene music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling and this continues right through the movie. I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie this would make the story feel light- however they have completely failed here. Instead the music manages to give everything that movie feel in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them so that everything actually feels heavy.<br /><br />Another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic. In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this chance meeting/passing which im sure didnt happen in the book gives Tomas story more significance than it does make it light.<br /><br />There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed imo for the worst however this might have been done because the book simply doesnt convert well into a movie such is Kunderas style. This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film. A film which is as long as it is uncompelling. For those who havent read the book yet I recommend just reading that. For those who have I have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay-clear warnings.',neg

'This is no walk in the park. I saw this when it came out and havent had the guts to watch it again. You will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie. I felt like Id been severely beaten. What kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? This is our world what we have created what we have allowed to happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE are not responsible for this. Babenco made this film to wake us up to shake us to our very core and he succeeded. How can we be cruel or self-indulgent or neglectful of our children when we see the graphic results of such behavior? He is pointing a finger of accusation at us all for doing this to the lowliest and least powerful of our society. And if you arent doing something each day to prevent it then you are part of the problem. I am NOT a religious fanatic but this movie made me think about the state of my soul.',pos

'First dont be fooled by my family name. My mother was full blooded Italian so I really know Italian families and I LOVE mobster movies even the funny ones like this.<br /><br />For those people who have bad rapped this film (you know who you are) you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you dont know what good is. This is a damn funny and well-styled film. The fact that almost nobody is Italian in it is part of the joke so far as I can see. And what red-blooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I saw this film it won me over with the opening song by Rosemary Clooney who was as Irish as one can get but her pronunciation of the Italian words in Mambo Italiano is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly. (Hell I even bought the record the next day because of it.) Just the look of every garish thing in the apartment that I have personally seen in my relatives houses though not in the same place (which I found hysterical) sold it for me.<br /><br />This movie is like Goodfellas on laughing gas. I just wonder why there are no Burger Worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get? My guess is the crew ate it. The Fries are crispy. The shakes are creamy. My mouth is watering almost as much as it is thinking of the gorgeous Ms. Pfieffer. (And I never trusted clowns anyway.) And the three best things about this film are Mercedes Ruehls achingly funny mob wife spurned Dean Stockwell as her philandering husband Tony The Tiger and last but DEFINITELY not least the great mugging by Oliver Platt who should get more comic roles. And note to myself: find out where that black chick went. Ouch! Why does she work so infrequently? This picture is right alongside the great mob movies as it should be.',pos
'Ive barely just made it through one episode (Crouch End). The dialog was stilted and down-right cringe worthy. The acting was tragic. Eion Bailey despite his best attempts to be dramatic remains mostly expressionless. His eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie. The characters were cartoons each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random meandering plot. Cheesy special effects can be excused given the TV miniseries budget. But attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability. I get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare its overall quality to something else Id put this episode of Nightmares and Dreamscapes on par with the NBCs Hercules.',neg

Terri Hatcher as Dr. Monica Demonico didnt have enough lines but none the less still gorgeous and fun when on screen. I would love to know how the idea for this movie came up. Never have I seen a cast of people have so much fun in making comedy work! Soapdish is a must have and I am waiting for the DVD!!!',pos
'I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say Ben Johnson?! - he was a goddam MOVIE STAR guys a COWBOY and by 1976 he was scraping by playing a sheriff in stupid made for TV disaster movies such as this cashing in on the DEADLY SWARMS OF KILLER BEES that everyone apparently thought were coming to get us at the time. So theres these bees and they kill some people by flying in their mouth and going after them underwater. Eventually these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the entire swarm. The cops are like what do we do? Uh bees die when its cold. So where could we make it cold? I know - the stadium in New Orleans! So they drive this car and its attendant swarm of killer bees on and on through the streets of New Orleans with a bullhorn saying GET OFF THE STREETS OR YOU WILL BE STUNG TO DEATH. And the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with its broken toilets so becomes the narcotic doom of this particular buncha bees. I dont know which is the greater indignity on this great city...well I do but this one sucks too.

'I thought this movie was awful. I understand it was shot on a small budget but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just plain dumb. The plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic moron. In fact all of the characters were unsympathetic and none were fully developed at all. The audience relates to no one in the movie. It was supposed to be suspenseful but if you dont care about the characters its hard to get into the movie at all. I felt like an outsider being forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story. All the plot twists at the end were just a little too much - I was actually laughing when I guess I was supposed to be shocked. All in all I thought it was really just a bad movie.',neg

With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger... music almost like in say Conan... etc. Almost. But in the end its just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart of John Rhys-Davies flying in duel like those warriors in Hero or before-mentioned Crouching Tiger... I am really ashamed of poor old John. He is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better. So as you - so if you still have a chance just watch something else.',neg
'Whether youre a fan of the series which inspired it or not theres no denying this is a patchy piece of work. But in the best possible sense. Keen to get away from the trappings of old sitcoms which made an uneasy transition to the big screen Messrs Pemberton Dyson Shearmsith and Gatiss have gone down a different road addressing the problems of dealing with their success along with adding other creations and inevitably rehashing some of their best-loved characters. Its a pity they didnt stick to just a more consistent League of Gents movie because as inventive as including themselves in the screenplay is it weakens the finished movie. Well worth renting though.',pos

'I gave this a 10 because its the best film of its kind...a good old-fashioned T & A film in the shadow and spirit of Animal House. I saw this with a similar film called Swap Meet and both were good of their type...a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Lets be honest...there are more breasts in this movie than one could imagine for an R-rated movie. From beginning to end they just seem to keep showing up on screen (sunbathing scenes bedroom scenes and of course the climactic football game). Also a memorable kissing booth (kiss me Clutz!) Everybody seems to be having a good time in their roles (several Playboy Playmates Danny Bonaduce several familiar TV and movie actors etc.). The only complaint I have to register is that Lisa Londons character is called by her last name OHara and not a good 1970s name like Olivia (or even Ora or Ona or O...??!!). I saw this again in the late 1980s with my now ex-wife (pretty well endowed herself) and she couldnt believe I was actually enjoying the movie!! She was probably jealous!! Again this movie is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon...just dont think too hard!',pos
'One of the best true-crime movies ever made and very faithful to Truman Capotes book which invented the true-crime novel genre. Haunting Quincy Jones musical score and terrific acting by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry the killers. Why Wilson didnt go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me.<br /><br />The black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch. The re-creation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off. The movie was filmed in the actual Clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders. The movie has a very documentary feel---besides the scenes at the actual Clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to. Nancy Clutters beloved horse Babe is even in the movie. Will Geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real Clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie. <br /><br />This is a solid movie scary every time you see it.',pos
'Bell Book and Candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century very similar to the phenoms we see today (back in the 70s - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). It made Novak a huge star put a nice item on Jack Lemons resume cast new light on Jimmy Stewart and gave Lancaster and Gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both went on to continue to play witches and other curious old bats in film and television).<br /><br />Along with the 40s movie I Married a Witch (which helped to make Veronica Lake an icon) Bell Book and Candle inspired the grand film and TV fascination with all things witchy that began with Bewitched and has continued through Practical Magic Worst Witch and Harry Potter.<br /><br />What I rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative Xmas movie. The story takes place over the Christmas holidays and despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft actually embodies a great deal of Xmas spirit (giving love family self-sacrifice etc).<br /><br />I will always watch this movie (have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90s) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season. It has style substance a great cast and terrific production values. And like Adams Rib it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time are radical even now (in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful) and so always seems ahead of the times.',pos
'Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director even as far as B movie directors go but Haunting Fear is probably one of his better films. Yes it does butcher the great Poe story Premature Burial and yes it is badly paced and uneven throughout but it is also pretty entertaining. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a pretty fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard a veteran of many early 90s soft-core movies actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress. You will also enjoy small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes. The ending didnt make much sense!',neg
'Soylent Green IS...a really good movie actually.<br /><br />I never wouldve thought it. I dont really like Heston in his sci-fi efforts. Hes one of those actors who like Superman manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And indeed he sneers his way through much of Soylent Green too but as hes supposed to be playing an overconfident bully I dont really mind.<br /><br />I can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie. Soylent Green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - it looks just like 1973) and its lacking in action. But I admired the films vision of a complex corrupt and highly stratified society and I was so pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving funny final role. Nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with Heston - really make the movie.<br /><br />The message of Soylent Green is pretty relevant these days when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to. Funny isnt it to see Heston in a prototype Michael Moore movie...',pos
'seriously people need to lighten up and just accept that funny is funny and this movie is f**king hilarious. Better than the first and Knoxville really grew a pair for this film and did way more crazier stunts then the first. If Ebert and Roper(not saying that Im a huge fan of theirs) can look past the pure idiocy of this film enough to give it 2 thumbs up then i think other people can to. I wasnt sure what to expect from this but i was floored and it is rare when a sequel is better than the original. This new one I believe exceeds the first big time. so do what i didjust relax kick back try not to barf at some points and laugh your ass off.',pos
'John Carpenters brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of Sci-Fi and horror adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the Antarctic setting. Carpenters direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg Carpenter doesnt hold back on the incident as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore. However he never loses touch with the human side of the story as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.<br /><br />9/10',pos
'In 1983 Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster and that he did-- with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. The result was `Scarface starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles. The story begins in May of 1980 when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel Cuba to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States. 125000 left Cuba at that time for the greener pastures of freedom in America and most were honest hard-working people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted. But not all. Among the `Marielitos who streamed into Florida approximately 25000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of Cubas jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption who Castro had merely wanted to be rid of. And they too saw America as a land of opportunity even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier. And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino) known to his associates as `Caracortada. Scarface.<br /><br />Now that he was free of the yoke of Communism under which he had grown up Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in Florida he was determined to have it all. Wealth and power-- that was Montanas dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in Miami by the name of Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). Lopez it seems had a brother in Cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of Castros goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to Castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in `Little Havana along with Montana and all of the Cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives. And in short order Montana sees to it that Lopezs brother has been avenged and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of America.<br /><br />Lopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets Montana and his friend Manny (Steven Bauer) released from the holding camp and puts them to work. In his day Capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but Lopez has the modern day equivalent and its even more lucrative: Cocaine. Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life but once he has a taste of it Montana isnt satisfied with whatever crumbs Lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be: At the `top. With a cold-blooded iron will Montana decides hell do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost. but before its over he will realize the price for his dream and hell pay it; but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what its like to be The Man. And he will also know whether or not it was worth it.<br /><br />In step with De Palmas vision Pacino plays Montana larger-than-life and he does it beautifully. From the accent he affects (which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right-- and he did) to the body language and the attitude hes got it all and it makes Montana convincing and very real. What he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors (De Niro would be one) can. This is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about Montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level; but Pacinos screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though its hard to become emotionally involved with him. Its quite simply a dynamic memorable performance.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom. As Elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of Montanas dream Pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance. She like Pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and sultry demeanor.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina) Miriam Colon (Mama Montana) F. Murray Abraham (Omar) Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein). An excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed `Traffic and `Blow and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of Peckinpahs `The Wild Bunch De Palmas `Scarface originally panned by critics has since been cited by many as being the definitive American gangster saga. Much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing. But if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end. And like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time. But the reward is always worth it and thats the way it is with this film. I rate this one 8/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />',pos
'I think that Toy Soldiers is an excellent movie. Its one of the only movies that aside from some well known actors has an unknown cast that can actually act. In my opinion the plot is captivating. It keeps your attention without having an outrageous story that couldnt possibly happen in real life. I think that everyone would enjoy this movie. Sean Astin always seems to pick the perfect movies to be in that showcase his talent. Hes very underrated and doesnt get the recognition that he deserves. Other movies that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this movie and Rudy really showcase him because he is the main character in both. I hope that he someday gets the accolades he deserves for his acting. If you want to see a great movie you need to check this one out and if you are a Sean Astin fan you will definitely like this movie.',pos
'It is is very sad to see someone of the calibre of George C Scott in a low budget thriller which would have been better if the original novel was written by Graham Greene and directed by someone somewhat more experienced in the genre. NOT TO MENTION A BETTER CINEMATOGRAPHER. There are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and carnival merely glossed over rather than captured to locate the movie solidly in the exotic setting of the novel.<br /><br />Elsewhere in the viewer comments on this site one very astute observer complained about the variety of diabolically bad accents in this film. Ever since I saw George C Scott as Rochester in Jane Eyre I have prayed for him NEVER to ever accept again a role which required him to assume a British accent. Just every now and then he could just possibly pass for British or a very British sounding South African played obviously by an American actor. I can stomach Meryl Streeps extraordinarily laboured accents (both British and Australian) - at least she gets it right even though with every utterance she demands that we marvel at her skill. Well I am sorry that Mr. Scott is no Meryl Streep and it just destroys the illusion - like having Michele Yeoh speak excruciating Mandarin with a strong Singaporean accent in Crouching Tiger etc.<br /><br />Peterson acts no differently than what we see on CSI. Except he is still very handsome and more or less slim in this movie. He is the Harrison Ford of TV. Same old expressions for every emotion every situation. No on second thought Ford has two - perplexed/pained and happy. I have never seen a smile on Mr. CSI!',neg
'The real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor. A visual treat to the eye the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart. I was intrigued at first by the idea of Dietrich and Boyer leaving religion in order to find their capacity for love. What follows is a huge disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment. Dietrichs amazing wardrobe outshines her performance -- at times her face is frightening to look at -- a unfeeling mask. As a monk Boyer held the formula for the monasterys liquer (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) -- when he leaves his marriage to god the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion. The viewer feels Boyer was well rid of his past. However the journey that follows is all too predictable.',neg
'My wife Kate and I absolutely loved the series and cant wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!). I would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because I am old and grey and still interested in life:-). If anyone has the full lyrics please send them.<br /><br />Of course one big reason why my wife and I liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually. Its great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience. The human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show.<br /><br />This series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites Spooks and Hustle.',pos
'I just bought this movie yesterday night and I LOVE it. Everyone did great acting in it especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera. The whole plot was great and as Dunn said in the extras on the DVD they made it seem like he was reliving the whole thing all over again. This movie has made my number one spot in my favorite movies! I cant stop replaying scenes over and over again just to see it again. Ive never done that with any other movie. I would definitely recommend this to other people to watch because it is such a great movie and if you like Bam Margera its a perfect movie for you!! The little montages that they show in between every scene are just great. I think that those have to be my favorite parts of the movie. They are very sad with mostly music from the band HIM which of course is my favorite band.',pos
'I stopped short of giving Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant (somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit). But other than that the movies a hoot. Portraying middle class New York couple Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) trying to build a house in Connecticut this flick has something for everyone.<br /><br />Grant is his usual flippant self while Loy does quite well as merely a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs as Jims and Muriels lawyer Bill Cole who seems to have more plans than hes making clear. As for the house itself...throughout most of the movie youll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there. The builders contractors and others also provide their fair share of laughs.<br /><br />All in all a comedy classic. Also starring Louise Beavers Reginald Denny Sharyn Moffett Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.',pos
'Basic structure of a story: Beginning Middle End.<br /><br />Sometimes this structure is played with and we get Memento or Irreversible and the story plays backwards. Sometimes its just not linear a la Pulp Fiction. Regardless they all have a beginning middle and end.<br /><br />This is the first film I have ever seen that doesnt have an end.<br /><br />Beginning: Girls best friend is expelled.<br /><br />Middle: Girl needs to cope without best friend.<br /><br />End: Non existent.<br /><br />Not that having an end wouldve saved this film but at least it would have been complete.<br /><br />Its an exercise in apathy; we get a party-mix of characters and they all turn out to be duds. Boring vain vapid and pallid imitations of people.<br /><br />And heres the action within this film: NOTHING HAPPENS. Nothing at all happens. Mischa Barton tries to talk with a plummy English accent Dominique Swain whines a lot and Brad Renfro receives a blow job from some old guy. End of movie.<br /><br />By the time the credits rolled I had a horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel: periods of time those precious minutes of our life have just been wasted.<br /><br />The only passable point (and that is a very emphatic ONLY) is Brad Renfro. He acts well. Lacey Chabert I tend to like but no luck here. Due to good work in other films I will forgive Mischa Barton this travesty but I hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvement.<br /><br />Please I implore you. Avoid. Dont fool yourself into thinking Ill make up my own mind. My sister told me to never see this and I ignored her wanting to make up my own mind. That was a bad decision.<br /><br />I have never hated a film. There are many I dont like but I have never hated a film. Until I saw this.',neg
'This was longer than the Ten Commandments All Lord of the Rings and the Matrix Trilogy combined. My oh My what a nightmare. This is the single biggest over-hype of 2006. THere is not a moment that is not scripted and clichéd. Movie Musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer. Dreamgirls takes the route of Chinese Water Torture in the form of endless music montages shoddy acting and poor directing choices (Seriously Mr. Condon did you HAVE to do the old Billboard countdown shots?

'Somehow they summed up the 60s ten years that radically changed our country in four hours. And what a painful four hours it was. They trivilized the major events and happenings and they claimed it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family. If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash. What was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways but managed to attend every major 60s event through the country. And the second family was such a non-factor. They devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family. That poor son...

'The inspiration for this film was the fact that American Gangsters are well dresses but the Aussies well when you might kill a guy as soon as look at the blighter then you can dress as badly as you want and people wont criticize you.<br /><br />Jimmy is fighter an illegal boxer sometimes bouncer and is offered work by Pando the local gangster boss in the cross (That is Australias notorious Kings Cross District not the Cross of London fame as many a British backpacker finds out the hard way).<br /><br />Due to feelings of love he stuffs up a job loses a lot of money and has to get it to Pando before Pando and his heavies can kill him.<br /><br />Lots of dark humour interesting action revelations about the Australias underside and human nature. It is very centred in the Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian criminals (versus the American and British ones).<br /><br />One problem is that each of the elements of the story dont have enough substance and depth but it is a painting with broad strokes that covers a lot of area not covered previously so as an overall package it is worthwhile.<br /><br />Team it up with Chopper and Dirty Deeds for your Aussie Crime fest or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Millers Crossing for an International falling short of the criminal gangs fest.<br /><br />By the way Bryan Brown is a great actor who has just done a huge number of really bad movies. Here is one of his great movies.',pos
'When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B cant turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate. The college is the ideal place with you learning what you want or doing nothing. The school faces opposition from the proper college which ends up closing it down. The film ends on a high and i recommend you watching it. Its does have it flaws but it is a feel good cheerful film with a few unpredictable twists.',pos
'Rabbit Fever is one of those film oddities. Its an enjoyable 90 minutes demands little of the viewer and delivers as much and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot I think that Rabbit Fever would be rather well received. Which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas.<br /><br />The movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the Rabbit Vibrator. The film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product. The narrative is 100\% tongue in cheek throughout.<br /><br />The storyline is strong an introduction to some well rounded and likable characters some enjoyable back-story peripheral characters and situations develops into an engaging story and pleasing conclusions. Sadly theres nothing that feels clever or new. <br /><br />Rabbit Fever has some sharp moments a few switches that hint at what the writers are capable of and all credit to them its not just 90 minutes of knob gags and innuendo I could probably watch it with my mother. But theres a laziness about some of the scenes that holds it back those moments went you are up for it when you want it to be outrageous and all you get is a dollop of sit-com.<br /><br />I chuckled I left the theatre feeling empathy for the characters but I also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90 minute reel of made for TV light entertainment and tried to put it into national cinema. <br /><br />I think Rabbit Fever achieves some of what it set out to do its a quirky subject a rounded storyline a well presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes. But theres nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a movie theatre environment. Quite the opposite - a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer chance to grab a breath of life that Rabbit Fever seems to lack.',neg

Alyson and Dave are trying to rebuild an old home and restore it to comfortable living conditions.

I only wish Karen would appear in more films I miss her great talents.',pos
'There are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments. This is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera the book or other Carmen movies seen before. It just stands for itself and I must say that this Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and the art direction the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience. Lets take it as it is.<br /><br />And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichés in the movie. Well historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. It is not only an accurate portrait of the black Spain of knife and espadrille that Goya portrayed so vividly but its also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. Honestly anyone who doesnt want to see any cliché about Spain shouldnt buy a ticket to see Carmen but in this case those clichés are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices.<br /><br />Another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines. If all the rest of the audience did the problem most likely lies somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with her Andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. Her Argentinian partner Leonardo Sbaraglia gives also a convincing portrait of the Basque officer that became a bandolero and her accent is very well learned.<br /><br />No less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is horrible suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures he found homosexually arousing without mentioning it explicitly. And that was not totally fair for the rest of us especially for the ones that hadnt detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didnt necessarily had to care for. Im not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role because thats what we got. Paz Vega IS Carmen and an excellent one in Vicente Arandas movie.',pos
'Inspired by Hitchcocks STRANGERS ON A TRAIN concept of two men swapping murders in exchange for getting rid of the two people messing up their lives THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN is an original and very inventive comedy take on the idea. Its a credit to Danny DeVito that he both wrote and starred in this minor comedy gem.<br /><br />ANNE RAMSEY is the mother who inspires the films title and its understandable why she gets under the skin of DANNY DeVITO with her sharp tongue and relentlessly putting him down for any minor infraction. BILLY CRYSTAL is the writer whos wife has stolen his book idea and is now being lionized as a great new author even appearing on the Oprah show to bask in adulation he should be enjoying. Thus DeVito gets the idea of swapping murders to rid themselves of these nuisance factors.<br /><br />Of course everything and anything can happen when writer Carl Reiner lets his imagination roam with unending ideas for how the plot develops. And its amusing all the way through providing plenty of laughs and chuckles along the way as well as a good deal of suspense.<br /><br />For devotees of black comedy this one is guaranteed to please.',pos
'Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very high-rated anime in almost every review page youll find on the web.

A very well drawn perfectly animated world that is.<br /><br />I cant tell much of the story without spoiling it so Ill just say that its a high school comedy... and yet its not. I cant really say what its about really.<br /><br />Seriously Im a HUGE anime fan and Ive got around 50 full series and Im not kidding when I say that even though I havent finished watching Haruhi Suzumiya it is actually standing in a very high rank in my personal collection. I fell in love at first sight with this one and I assure you that at the very least you wont be indifferent to its irresistible charm.

'This certainly is one of the best western movies produced in the new Millennium. Its an homage to all the stars of the great TV western classics and it is the ultimate revival of the western movie. The story of two brothers who meet after the War between the States and end up on different sides of the law isnt new but interesting nonetheless and the shootouts and the atmosphere are great. There is some graphic violence like bad guys getting chopped to death with an axe or women being shot down in cold blood and Lee Majors doesnt take part in the action until the very end thats why I gave it 9 out of 10 points. But it still is one of the best new western productions Ive ever seen. Ive had the honor and pleasure to meet Chris McIntyre at the Festival of the West and have a nice chat with him and Ive had the chance to meet Buck Taylor who performs the role of town doctor. In my opinion we ought to be much obliged to Chris McIntyre for his efforts to gather that many stars of the classic TV westerns and SASS around him to perform in a new western such as this. Chris has an outstanding talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters too. Both are young and promising and I think we should see more of them in future western productions. I sincerely enjoyed this western movie - it was worth every minute. I hope that Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other western movies and present us with some more great productions such as this one. Great work Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)',pos

'I love John Saxon in anything hes in. The one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled Please Do Not Watch This Movie Called: Zombie Death House. The $1000 dollar Shock Insurance Certificate is dear Fred Olen Rays tricky way of making you spend 14 dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major 70s cheese legend. Ray being the front man at RetroMedia. Ray by the way makes Charles Band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a Ford Falcon. Just plain bad now the both of them- and boring besides. Its great that Ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases its public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of Zombie Death House- (the word Zombie sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of F.O.R.) THE ONLY WAY TO DO SERVICE TO THIS TRIPE IS TO RELEASE IT ON THE DOLLAR MARKET FOR THE CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND FANS OF SAXON!!!

'The original movie Man From Snowy River is one of the best Ive seen nearly perfect. A Lady and the Tramp storyline in two senses--rich girl/poor boy and ability vs. bloodline. The sequel however is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous overblown Disneyfied mess best summarized as Rambo Meets the Black Stallion. Without the charm of The Black Stallion. The young hero comes back from a 3-year absence and suddenly hes Superman on horseback; in the original good film he was real and believable but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel. Ive hardly been as disappointed in a movie and at times this thing made me quite angry--they missed hardly a cliché. Brazen audience manipulation--do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them to make them happy? A mess of a movie.',neg
'Some of the acknowledged Altman masterpieces seem sadder to me now. Maybe its me. Like the last reviewer I even like this lesser Altman (shown recently on FMC) although I dont think he was aiming at a wide audience. Organization politics as a microcosm for public campaigns. Some of this satirical docudrama is now dated like Dick Cavett watching the Tonight Show but I found much of the dialog funny and insightful (e.g. You are for real. That means youre no threat to anyone). The story isnt profound but I liked it. And the performances are funny especially Cavett (as himself) Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative figurehead Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of Parliament) as a left wing ideologue (in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics) and Carol Burnett as a basket case. All in the inimitable Altman style although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual. But pretty inimitable.',pos

'Ive seen many horror shows over the years like Nightstalker that dealt with the Wendigo legend so I was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the Halloween season. Man was I mistaken. The whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property. Ve-ery scary - not! This movie has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor another total loser.<br /><br />Its getting harder and harder to believe anything Hollywood puts forward about scary movies since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore. What idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made? Go back to the drawing board fellas and do something useful with those millions of greenbacks you have to throw around.',neg

'The Mayor Of Hell has the feel of an early Dead End Kids film but with a much harder edge and very few light spots preceding the first appearance of the Dead Enders by four years. James Cagney has a full screen opening credit even though technically the mayor of the movies title is actually portrayed by Frankie Darro one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes. Darros character is Jimmy Smith a young tough whos befriended by Patsy Gargan (Cagney) and is elected to the position when Gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatory.<br /><br />Warner Brothers made a lot of these types of films attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty. This movie is quite gritty with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a Jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school. The rules at the reformatory are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; step out of line and you answer personally to Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges).<br /><br />Cagneys role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory on the outside hes still nominally in control of a criminal racket. The films attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as Gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen. Not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this.<br /><br />Warner Brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled Crime School featuring Humphrey Bogart in the Cagney role and Billy Halop in the Frankie Darro part. If youre partial to the Dead End Kids youll probably like the latter film better since it also offers familiar faces like Leo Gorcey Huntz Hall Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too with Bogarts warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout. Both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters in Mayor Madge Evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for Cagneys character.<br /><br />Curiously a lot of James Cagneys early films arent commercially available so youll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on Turner Classics or source the film from a private collector. Personally I cant get enough of this kind of stuff and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the Thirties and Forties.',pos
'Im a big fan of Lucio Fulci; many of his Giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time but this made for TV movie is extremely sub par and not what Ive come to expect from the great Italian director. The film is neither interesting like some of Fulcis more tame Giallos or gory like the majority of his cult classics; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas and ultimately ensuring that the film isnt very good. The film works from a plot that has been used many times previously but still its an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife which is the ultimate unknown. This film focuses on Giorgio Mainardi; a man that isnt exactly well liked and after he dies of an apparent stomach hemorrhage there arent many people that are sad to see him go. This means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife and so he decides to try and get to the bottom of his death and his only ally in this endeavour is his daughter.<br /><br />The video that I saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is in the style of HP Lovecraft and thats one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film Ive ever seen. There is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the Stuart Gordon/Lovecraft film From Beyond - which is a lot better. The film does benefit from a distinctly Italian style and the score is rather good. Unfortunately however Fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it - and so the theme quickly becomes annoying. The plot plays out in a really boring way and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost desperately trying to find things out or the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members. This movie was made for Italian TV and so its not surprising that its all rather tame. Theres a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; but this isnt the Fulci we all know and love. Overall this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of Fulcis talents. Not worth bothering with unless youre a Fulci completist.',neg
'Sharkys Machine is a crime drama set in early 80s Atlanta. It stars Burt Reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city. The story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to its knees. Sharkys link to bringing down this syndicate is a high-priced hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie. The action sequences are well done for the early 80s and the soundtrack / score are pretty good. The acting is B-level but this is a pretty decent film to have in your DVD collection.<br /><br />Overall 7/10<br /><br />Peace <br /><br />Buggieblade',pos
'This movie is really special. Its a very beautiful movie. Which starts with three orphans Sho his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi Theyre poor childrens living on the street but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money and then their able to live on to buy a house and their life seems to become much better. Theyre making new friend life-friends. But something went wrong and theyre becoming enemies and it all ends up with them killing each other.<br /><br />I was negative about this movie in the beginning because when singers (Gackt - Solo ex-singer in Malice Mizer Hyde - Solo singer in LArc~en~Ciel both very famous in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer) trying to become actors but this isnt like the other singers-going-actors-movies. Theyre doing a great job and with no earlier experience in movies (except for Lee-Hom who had been in two movies before).<br /><br />This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe thats a little because Im a very big fan of Hyde but - it was this movie who made me discover him.<br /><br />Well Gackt (playing the main character - the orphan Sho) was a part of the group who wrote the script and it was he who insisted that Hyde should play Shos friend the vampire Kei. At that time they didnt know each other at least not like friends. But after the movie they became really good friend and that shows us too that they really worked hard on this movie and that they had good cooperation.<br /><br />The movie have many different feelings running trough the story Love Hate Sadness Pain Loneliness Happiness and so on. I think the first hour are the best its so beautiful. After that people are dying Keis leaving and it all changes so much. But still its a great movie its the only movie who has ever made me cry it ends up so sad but still beautiful.<br /><br />So if you havent seen this movie you really should. Because its wonderful but sad. You wont regret it. ^^',pos
'This movie is very entertaining and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality. Other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by Murphy the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor. It has some pretty good special effects and exciting action scenes.<br /><br />As a finder of lost children Murphys character starts off looking for a missing girl which leads him on the path for which others believe he was chosen - - to protect the Golden Child. The young boy is born as an enlightened one destined to save the world from evil forces but whose very life is in danger if not for the help of Murphy and his beautiful mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector.<br /><br />Also there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts. One such scene is where the Golden Child that Murphys character is solicited to protect is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from and the child is tested on his choice.<br /><br />This is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware. As we accept this premise of the plot we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie with a good plot fine acting and for the most part pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of Martial Art fighting and Eddie Murphy humor.',pos
'I think I read this someplace: Joe Johnston (director of the film and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for work on the first Star Wars film) and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie Rocket Boys (I guess) was lacking something.<br /><br />One day they were messing with a PC program that forms words from other words (ie: you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words) I think the technical term is an anagram<br /><br />Anyway they typed in Rocket Boys and sure enough what comes back is October Sky. They were shocked to say the least. The title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around Sputnik.

'...for the Lt to have chosen this one. First the film wasnt horrible it was just Hollywood. Worst case I-need-this-to-happen-or-we-have-no-movie scenario: if Willis mission was to save the doctor but she was adamant that her people make it out of the missionary he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her. He would not have compromised his package for the refugees. Thats not how it works. But as I pointed out this is Hollywood we must have drama. This is why we make movies because reality isnt quite so complicated. However I did think that Willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry. That said there are also some well done battle scenes in the film. Its not a waste of time Tears of the Sun is worth the dvd rental fee. Check it out on a rainy day and youll be satisfied.',neg
'It opens - and for half an hour runs - like an educational programme on the Old Testament although not without humour. The movie finally begins to grow wings when the biblical cant gets dropped. In a scene of mixed success Martin Donovan (Jesus) decides to renege on kicking off the Apocalypse and the final quarter of an hour is a sort of humanist whats all the fuss about? play-out gilded with optimistic conjecture against a (retrospectively miserably ironic) long shot of the WTC twin towers.<br /><br />Apart from Donovans authority the acting is split. Theres the thespian melodrama of the rest of the cast: this though formally contrived for biblical presentation is appropriate for the modern paranoid comedy that Hartleys aiming at. But I was also pleasantly surprised at the contribution of PJ Harvey (credited thus and in danger of existing within the film solely as the pop star entity she is not least in a set piece scene in a record store and a perilously patchy soundtrack to which contributes). She remained cool - a sort of disingenuous lack of focus - in the manner of many pop icons who have taken to film (Im thinking the Jagger of Performance here) but nonetheless maintained a convincing integration with both cast and project.<br /><br />Ultimately affirmative but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like one and relies more on the perseverance than the imagination of its audience. 4/10',neg
'You the Living (2007)<br /><br />Mordant. Ive never written that word before but it comes to mind here. Let me look it up. Well its part of it--corrosive but also funny as heck. So corrosively funny. This is a dour film for sure with so much dry dry dry wit and quirky humor its impossible not to like it on some level. Filmed in a very spare style often with a static camera and really balanced stable compositions like theater stages we see a short enactment occur.<br /><br />But that makes it seem ordinary--which it is not. Ordinary life is shown to be frumpy ironic delightful coy and depressing. And impossible. We the living must live and since were alive we may as well take note. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you find yourself laughing and dont know why. Exactly. And the promo material somewhere said it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python and what they mean is it has the dry silent probing look of Ingmar Bermans famous Swedish films but it has the zany somehow touching elements of the British comedians. <br /><br />Id say definitely definitely watch at least half an hour of this. There is part of me that thought I was through by then--the rest continues in a similar assemblage of little skits and moments and they do gradually evolve but there is no great plot to follow or climax of the usual kind. There are some great moments later even just the attention to the thunderstorm which takes us out of the mundane human events nicely. <br /><br />The filming is gorgeous in its classical control almost like a series of Gregory Crewdson scenes (and outdoing the photographer actually). And the acting with all its very ordinary non-glam folksiness is right on. A startling beautiful odd experience.',pos
'Is nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well then watch Phat Beach. However dont rent it and definitely DO NOT buy it. That would be a big mistake.<br /><br />I watched this on TV and found myself laughing at certain points. I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard. However there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at. If you are looking for an extremely funny hood movie then watch Friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that this movie tries at..kind of) watch something like hoop dreams or Jasons Lyric. If you are lookin for some good black booty go watch a Dominique Simone porn flick because the nudity in this movie is nearly non-existent. However if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable go ahead and watch it. You will be slightly amused.<br /><br />***3 out of 10***',neg
'I am so confused. What in the world was this movie about? What was the killers motivation? He seemed quite angry but I have yet to figure out why. Nothing in this movie made sense. It had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. Which I guess would make it a hill. Or a pile. Of crap. The acting was horrible. When I searched for a few of the actors in this movie they had been in very few things that I had heard of and that came as absolutely no surprise. I cant decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again. Starting . . . NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) Really though dont waste your time with this. Theres so little substance that theres nothing there even just to make fun of. This was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks -- NO one of the worst flicks of ANY KIND that I have ever had the misfortune to watch and Ive seen quite a few.',neg
'This movie was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone much better than what I had already anticipated. It was definitely a heart-wrenching spectacular movie. It is an amazing story with amazing actors and creators. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (shouldnt surprise anyone) Derek Luke did a wonderful job as well.',pos
'I had high hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed. The film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache. The pacing was so slow the dialogue laughable and the film - well apart from a nice fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow.<br /><br />And why oh why does Hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit consumer approval. Agamemnon didnt die in Troy the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle! It annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap.<br /><br />And dont even start me on the lack of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman the war was fought over and it didnt even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other. No sparks no emotion no hope.<br /><br />I have to say in the films defence Brad Pitt Eric Bana and Peter O Toole acted very well with a bad script but that isnt enough to save this awful movie. <br /><br />Can anybody tell me where the £200 million budget went? Maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres - where did they get all those trees?<br /><br />I am so disappointed it hurts.',neg
'I´ve been able to see this great movie at the Fantasyfilmfest in Berlin and when I went out of the cinema I felt like being drugged down *g*! I´ve really seen lots of movies and there are just a few I´d call perfect like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subconscious Cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people watching it in Berlin went out of the room and I can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock for someone living in his/her perfect world day by day dreaming his/her dreams not thinking bout the horror on our planet-in our life! I don´t think I have to describe the story of the film for you because of the people having already written on this page! It´s a movie that shows everything and more!!! Gets 10 points + from 10!!!

'Well the name in the summary should tell you everything. FRED OLEN RAY - the modern King of low budget flicks be it for TV or direct to video (I doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore - with the death of drive-in B-movie double features and all).<br /><br />Creator of such cult(?) classics like Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers and Dinosaur Island....<br /><br />Well I kind of like this guys stuff. Its mostly entertaining (in a distinctly cheesy campy and especially cheap kind of way) and if hes one thing hes a pro - something you cant say for all guys in the movie biz.<br /><br />But this one flick here is among the weaker ones in his oevre. Insipid acting an uninspired script and lame jokes conspire to make your brain go numb in a matter of minutes. If you are out for real F.O.R. goodness (or rather badness) look out for the above mentioned ones and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s (I think he lost a bit of his edge lately).',neg
'The CinemaScope color cinematography of Leon Shamroy is quite remarkable hereincluding his use of colored filters for<br /><br />various scenes. The Alfred Newmann Score has to be the most sensual and seductive score Hollywood ever produced. Its a shame it is no longer available on CD. The actors however never rise to the occasion. The accents are so varied from the subdued British of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision. Tommy Rettig is jarringly American. Acting styles span the range from zombie-like to stilted. Only Ustinov as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal. The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single God Ra - persecuted by the authorities has its interesting points. But when the films plot fades it is the haunting music and visuals that remain.',neg
'I originally saw this movie in a movie theater on Times Square in the late eighties. Who would have thought this film would spawn two sequels and have this cult following.Night of the Demons was like most other films that came out at the time.A group of horny teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated local and then are killed off one at a time in various gruesome ways.Come to think of it the formula still is used and still seems to work as evidenced by Saw II that I recently saw.<br /><br />I saw Mimi Kinkade at a Fangoria convention about six years ago and she was so gentle hearted!I guess that makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon possessed woman in all these horror flicks.Anyway I just this film again on VHS cassette and this movie still holds up.A little slow at the beginning as I remembered when I first saw it but then it quickly picks up pace. One of the eighties horror classics and worth a look!',pos
'After having problems in Chicago the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who wont allow them to live in peace.<br /><br />The Messengers starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film thats a lot more humorous than frightening. After reading the premise I thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential. Unfortunately the film didnt live up to its potential although I should have expected this since the trailer was awful. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was full of silly sequences and bland dialog. The characters were not developed at all and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots so it was hard to feel sympathy for them.<br /><br />The directors did a horrible job at building up suspense. They mainly relied on cheap scares like loud noises and random jumps. The music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next scary moment. I also didnt like how they pretty much just used one location for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of the story and thats where the majority of the filming took place so it got a little boring after awhile to see the same area. Also I didnt like the close-ups of the actors. During a conversation the camera would continually jerk from character to another in the span of five seconds and it got really annoying. The directors did create a decent atmosphere and they do get some points for making their movie stylish. However since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects its not really that hard to make your movie look nice especially if you are working on a Hollywood film.<br /><br />The acting was atrocious and if this movie had been released in December Im sure it would have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in Panic Room but you wouldnt be able to tell she has talent by watching her performance in The Messengers. She was okay at acting scared and thats it. The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was just awful when it came to everything. It sounded like she was reading her lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions I have ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just very wooden and he showed almost no emotion. John Corbett gave the best performance and he had a couple of good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to out act many of the adult actors. Overall this lame horror film is not worth watching because of its blandness and lazy film-making. Rating 4/10',neg
'It is such a shame when actors and actresses of high quality get involved with pure crap probably because they were offered a great deal of money. Not one of Helen Mirrens better career moves. The acting of the teens is simply appalling not helped by a script that is in parts simply inept.<br /><br />Most of Kevin Williamsons work is above average box office dross but this is really below par. <br /><br />This is the sort of movie that you watch on TV when there is nothing better on and you have had half a bottle of wine to drink and are waiting for the Pizza to be delivered so you can drink the other half.',neg
'I caught this movie on the Horror Channel and was quite impressed by the films Gothic atmosphere and tone. As a big fan of all things vampire related I am always happy to see a new variation of the vampire mythos in this case a ghoul-like creature residing in a Lovecraftian other dimension. The director has done a brilliant job of conveying the dark mood of the subject using the decadent art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a tale of love spanning time and space- the pure love of friendship opposed to the lust for blood and life by the vampires in the story. The characters in the story are transported to another dimension by the means of a mind-altering substance where a shape-shifting vampire creature appears to grant them their hearts desires whilst draining them of their life essence. There are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I enjoyed watching the 2 main male characters in the story Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich who were very attractive hunks always a plus point in a vampire story for the female viewers! The special effects make up and creature effects were well done and the set design of the vampires dimension was very effective. All in all an enjoyable take on vampire myths and recommended for anyone who likes their vampires with some intelligence and not just action. The only thing missing to make it even better would have been a bit more eroticism and nudity as it would have suited the plot and themes.',pos
'Dr. Sayer(Philippe Leroy) a wealthy physician with psychological issues regarding the opposite sex kidnaps an employee Maria(Dagmar Lassander) a free-thinking liberal woman who believes men must be the ones fixed instead of females. Sayer retreats to his palatial estate running Maria through a humiliating series of mind games threatening to molest and kill her. Sayers desire it seems is to dominate her body mind and soul making her his sexual slave obeying his commands adhering to his every wish and whim. After resistance at first Maria slowly teeters towards his objective but has plans of her own..she says she wishes to help Sayer relinquish his sadistic behavior towards women so that he could love and not feel such yearning desires to harm. It seems that Sayer has her under his grip agreeing to certain rather embarrassing scenarios(..such as lotioning his toes making love to a blow-up doll which is a recreation of himself often spending time topless and even getting hosed down when she slaps him hard across the face bringing blood from his nose)which almost break her but something happens as the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with Maria..and through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness Maria gains an upper hand toying with Sayers lust for her body.<br /><br />More of a battle of wills a kind of sexual warfare where it seems one is in charge when in fact the other truly has the upper hand. Through a great deal of the film Sayer mistreats Maria forcing her(..it seems)to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature. Her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well designed fortress..its a typical European art deco kind of palace fashioned and orchestrated by a man who has kept to this weekend retreat of his for quite a spell(..it features walls and doors opening at his command with an area quarantined off for his victims). But once Maria seemingly downs a bottle of pills as a result of her anguish at his hands the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him. He finds that he actually craves her and Maria uses this to her advantage playing hard to get when Sayer wishes to embrace and ravage her(..and I could understand his frustration because she has this allure that can drive a man crazy)<br /><br />I felt the film works ultimately as a war cry for women their empowerment and uprising against men who have the notion that they should always have control sexually and mentally. The twist finalizes this ideal. I couldnt swallow Sayers fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen..we see how he develops his toned athletic figure and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin. If he is so well fit and spends such time developing himself for the extracurricular activities which follow his regimen how could he suffer the fate which follows his finalizing the deal with Maria at the end when she stops resisting his advances? <br /><br />Maria he would later admit is the first hes actually kidnapped; others from the past call-girls were paid for their services so that Sayer could feel the power of dominating a woman even if its all a fictitious charade brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex. The spontaneous decision to do so to take a leap from the norm costs him more than he could ever know.<br /><br />All this psycho-sexual sub-text is rather fascinating to see unravel but Dagmar Lassander such a yummy sex kitten was my reason for enjoying it so..without her I couldnt have liked it as much because shes vital as a victim worth striving to obtain. Perhaps the films highlight the delicious dance as Lassander clothed in gauze(!) unravels the wardrobe exposing her breasts to a jazzy score..its the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and forehead sweat. Dagmar Lassander mustve been a joy for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so well..she has this kind of cool a sophistication and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers Dagmar transcends the part to create an iconic character which would define her career..even if the film isnt well known(..I found about through word of mouth). The provocative nature of the script and risqué subject matter might not appeal to certain crowds as it deals with sex(..and pain) in many different forms the dialogue quite illustrative and elaborative. At times I couldnt help but chuckle at Sayers comments towards an imprisoned Maria regarding how he enjoys making women suffer and the thrill he gets at forcing them into a type of slavery(..in an attempt to make the words poetic it all feels rather hokey). But Dagmar is the real reason to see it and the film to me works at its best as a fetish film a possible male fantasy with this seemingly prim and proper idealist captured and held against her will forced into a precarious situation her fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. Her submission and how she reacts towards his aggressive behavior with her(..there are times where she unfolds to a wavering desire to embrace him unveiling a possible attraction towards him which in itself might startle some who watch it)are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature. My other favorite scene besides the dance is the piano concerto with Sayer fondling Maria as she plays a soothing melody.',pos
'<br /><br />I thought that this movie lacked the building dramatic suspense the first movie had. This is hard to accomplish when the film takes place over a week. The original movie lead up to the final climatic scene over a period of a year and it still was less violent than the sequel. One good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly because the plot seemed rushed. When Rachels best friend died there was no funeral mentioned in the movie. Another bring down was the involvement of Amy Irving. All her scenes brought down the movies pace. The dialog in this movie was terrible. It in no way reflected the way kids talk. In conclusion this movie could have been a hit but fell apart after the opening scene.',neg
'This wonderful film is a love story and shows that not all relationships are destined to last. Even so they can be great & worth the pain & suffering of breakup.<br /><br />Director Pieter Verhoeff gives us an insight of the period around 1900 the way society (mis)treats women and how a very strong woman (Nynke) deals with. With great costumes landscapes lovely music and good actors and acting this photoplay draws you in for the length of the movie.<br /><br />At first the ending is a bit sudden a page describing the rest of her life scrolls. On reflection this is a great (the best) way to have your own fantasy create the rest of her life.<br /><br /> This was the second movie for me that had people sit while the end titles scrolled by (The first being Schindlers List). Apparently the movie had this effect on everybody.',pos
'I was duped into watching this by the many friendly reviews here. Boy are they way off mark! To give this 9 to 10 points and call it one of the best movies of the 1990ies is just unjustifiable. The big problem here is lack of pace and a paper-thin plot. Its like slapstick on Prozac. Everything trundles along predictably and listlessly. The plot is weak to begin with -- two garbage men peep on their foxy neighbour witness a murder and unravel a waste disposal conspiracy -- and the movie never manages to go much further. There are some amusing situations and decent acting but thats not anywhere near enough to save this jalopy of a movie.<br /><br />Its simply a comedy that doesnt get its fat ass off the ground so why waste your time?',neg
'Martin Ritt seems to be a director who was always interested in social issues (as the son of immigrants he had every incentive to be so especially since he was blacklisted in the 50s). Conrack is based on Pat Conroys novel The Water is Wide about his own experience in 1969 teaching a school of impoverished black children about the outside world much to the chagrin of the right-wing superintendent (Hume Cronyn). What added to the movies strength was the cultural and historical context: Conroy (Jon Voight) frustratedly tells another teacher how many of the children dont know about Paul Newman Sidney Poitier the Vietnam War or even where Vietnam is. He proceeds to enlighten them about all these factors.<br /><br />Somewhere I read a complaint that when Conroy played music for the children he only played white music. The truth is you cant blame the movie for that; it was based on Conroys real experience. Either way the movies a real gem.',pos
'For many years I thought I was the only person on the planet who had seen TEMPEST and I am so glad to learn that I am not the only person who discovered this sleeper somewhere in their movie-going travails. Loosely based on the Shakesperean play TEMPEST follows an architect (the late John Cassavettes in one of his best performances) bored with his work and his crumbling marriage (to real life spouse Gene Rowlads) who decides to chuck it all say the hell with the rat race and go live on an island with his daughter (Molly Ringwald in her film debut) and new girlfriend Aretha (a luminous Susan Sarandon). Even though Paul Mazursky is credited as director Cassavettes hand is all over this film...the long scenes filmed without cutting the improvisatory feel to the dialogue... the self-indulgent storytelling style this is definitely his show from beginning to end and if youre not a fan of his work the film will seem laboriously long and dull but if you are a fan there are rewards to be had. Cassavettes is surrounded by a first rate cast...his scenes with Rowlands crackle with intensity and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon is a stark contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in her film debut and there is a scene-stealing performance by the late Raul Julia as Kalibanos Cassavettes manservant on the island. Julia stops the show in one scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli singing New York New York. This film is sad and tragic and funny and intense. Yes its a little long and disjointed and it works a little too hard at being different (theres even a curtain call at the end of the film) but it never fails to hold the attention of those who like something a little different in their filmgoing.',pos

'Despite its budget limitations this is a great film proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash. The opening in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings is a nice red herring. After that a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which in turn causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isnt the first time such a thing has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears its a well-animated Plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area. Alright so its not Jurassic Park but its still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies.',pos
'Nonono. That is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film. Anthony Perkins is the one and ONLY Norman Batesas is Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane. This just seems like a colorized version of Psychowith a few mildly different touches thrown in for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is dull as ill Normanand Viggo Mortensons Sam Loomis seems too much the cowboy compared to the original. Please folksdo yourself some justice. Dont bother with this.

'Janeane Garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film calling it among other things anti-feminist. She has also said on her radio show she hates making romantic comedies because she doesnt believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This film is a trifle at best. She does her best but overall it was just another boring unbelievable romantic comedy that has no basis in the real world. Whereas there will be some who will say suspend your disbelief one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood. Janeanes character for some reason is usually filmed in shadows and darkness which makes her look unattractive while Umas character is filmed in lighter tones (which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film). That really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two. As many have said here and on other comment threads Janeane is not ugly but in fact quite beautiful. I havent read one review where someone said Uma was better looking. Having said that though I believe that Ben Chaplins character would more than likely stay with Uma not Janeane. Many men dont like really intelligent women (and many women dont like really intelligent men) and sadly Ben probably would have stayed with Uma. And despite the directors attempt to make Janeane unattractive it doesnt work. Her natural beauty comes through anyway.<br /><br />I think a lot of Janeanes male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character and actually scoring with Janeane. Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine) so take a cold shower gentlemen. This is the role that Janeane is best known for and thats a shame as this really isnt that good of a film.',neg

'Contains spoilers<br /><br />Hollow Man is probably the weakest movie that Paul Verhoeven director of great movies like Total Recall Starship Troopers and Robocop has ever made. <br /><br />Thats probably not his fault. For some reason Verhoeven got stuck with an utterly mediocre script and he made the best of it. <br /><br />The first part of this movie is rather good with lots of cynical jokes great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately the movie falls flat in the second part were it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad Alien clone.

'Some have commented on the subtitles not being a problem in this film - I beg to differ - the nuisances in the facial expressions and subtle interactions between the characters is such that you can not afford to take your eyes away for even a fraction of a second. I tried to watch on the DVD in English to overcome this problem (dont make this mistake the result is a travesty). The only way to get the full benefit is to watch it two or three times in quick succession so you know it and then ignore the subtitles. An acting master class - not in the dialogue but body language.<br /><br />It is the little things - the postmaster/shop keeper puffs out his chest and goes in to get his cap before delivering a letter from !France!. The Generals bemused expression as his delight in a bunch of perfect grapes elicits a biblical reference with a profundity worthy of Being There.<br /><br />The cinematography is awesome and the bleak minimalist village with its washed out colour just accentuates the sumptuousness of the feast when it comes. I have a friend who claims to be descended from the Borgias and whos family motto is If it is worth doing it is worth doing to excess - Amen.<br /><br />I laugh out loud and cry each time I watch this film',pos
'A few thoughts before I get to the heart of the film: 1) I have never seen so many bare breasts in a film before displayed in so many non-sexual scenes -- it was weird; 2) Joseph Fiennes where have you been? You charmed us in *Elizabeth* and *Shakespeare in Love* and then you went away for awhile. Mainstream American wants more! Okay Im a college English professor I have read this play many times and this is probably the best film version Ive seen of it. While individual aspects of other productions may have stood out this is the overall package put together well. Pacino is no Olivier but he doesnt need to be so get over it! The films cinematography is stunning and not just because of the bare breasts. Venice is portrayed amazingly and you do get a feel for really being there. Portias residential island is amazingly beautiful and the lighting is always tinted the proper way for the scenes appropriate moods.<br /><br />The anti-Semetism in this film/play is hard to watch especially at the end. Pacinos dropping to the knees and clutching his religious artifact is perhaps the most powerful moment of his on film since *The Godfather Part III* (when Michaels daughter is gunned down on the opera steps). Is the play anti-Semetic? Sure. Is *Othello* racist? Sure. Take it for what it is: a commentary on the Elizabethan era not a commentary on today.<br /><br />Fiennes is underutilized in the film but still a pleasure to watch. The women in the film are alright; no one really stood out here but they do blend in nicely with the scenery. Jeremy Irons and Pacino are excellent in the two juiciest roles adversaries until the end. Ive always felt Irons was underrated (I still get chills when I hear his voice from *The Lion King*) and Pacino is Pacino.',pos

'After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin) I was more than excited to watch his Masterpiece (O-Word Criterion) RIFIFI.<br /><br />Now i am a little bit disappointed about the story.<br /><br />So I have at least these five questions in my mind:<br /><br />1. In the final Countdown Louis Grutter shot from the inside a house the main Character Tony le Stéphanois. He couldnt know if he is still alive or not but he didnt care about it and ran directly after it outside the house (with the money) to reach his car. So of course Tony wasnt dead and shot him. BIG QUESTIONMARK.<br /><br />2. In another important scene the specialist in safes Cesar gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring (which was a part of the robbery) a Woman which was working for Louis Grutter in a night bar. Stupid because before this character wasnt THAT stupid. And of course Louis knew directly that Tony planned the jewel robbery. SMALL QUESTIONMARK.<br /><br />3.After the Gangsters behind Louis Grutter murder Mario Ferrati and his wifeTony and his best friend Joe planned a revenge against Louis gang. At the same time they dont care for the security of Joes wife and his five years old child. Of course Louis gang kidnapped the son. CHEAP and SIMPLE.<br /><br />4. The perfect heist: Of course this is the best 30min. long scene in the whole Plot without any word spoken in the whole time but was this a perfect heist?? Comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example Tony was taken a fire-extinguisher to banned the alarm. Also too SIMPLE.<br /><br />5. The Grutter gang went to the house of Mario because they knew (however....) the jewels will be there. Then they murder Mario and his Wife. And then? They are not searching for it! NO. They ran directly out of the apartment. And more. They not observing the apartment after it so Tony can go after a while (which was the same day) inside to take the jewels. BIG QUESTIONMARK.<br /><br />Over all: its a good movie. Because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene. Because of the very good cut (The end scene in the car through Paris is stunning) . Because of a very good actor called Jean Servais. Because of this Black/White fever you will get while watching it. Because of some other reasons too other user wrote about but please dont tell me this is a stunning story.',pos
'Curl up with this one on a dark and stormy night and prepare to be alternately amused irritated and frightened. The creaky old plot about about a phantom train thats said to run through the lonely English countryside at dead of night may be implausible but its a lot of fun. There are some wonderful old cliches like THE ACCIDENT which the locals can remember but wont talk about. But primarily the movies a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to showcase his particular brand of vaudeville style humour in between the scary bits. Askeys corny humor is not very trendy these days but if you just let it wash over you it can be fun. This is probably the best of Askeys movies.',pos
'If this is the authors and directors idea of a slice of life they are clinically manic depressives. A sad moody film at best with ubiquitously aimless and unhappy characters who negatively interact with disastrous results. This film is billed as a comedy. What was so funny about losing your home to an allegedly premeditated arson or the drug induced forcible rape of one of the main characters. Is this art imitating life? Jack Black was mildly amusing as the mountain man weed farmer. However even this segment of the film was rife with pathos. What was the point of living in the middle of nowhere with an entourage. If Blacks character was so paranoid why was he doing acid with a group of people right out of Woodstock? Is there no end to disconnected relationships a plot less script and scene transitions lacking any cohesiveness or logical chronology.',neg
'Okay. Who was it? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Are you tripping of your head on Ecstasy pipes? There were so many of you. Did you do it for a dare? Is this some kind of cult? Or did Guy Richie himself sign up 788 times under different names?<br /><br />Before I say anything else Ill say this. Just because you dont understand a film doesnt mean that its not great. Maybe youve had a bad day at work or you sat down to watch a film after you had a row with your wife and then werent in the mood. Maybe theres a more fundamental stumbling block- like you just dont have the mental capacity or a highly enough developed philosophical sense to engage with it. BUT. And this is a very very big but. The XXL elephant-sized mega-but to end all buts.<br /><br />PLEASE dont confuse incoherence for complexity and please dont confuse this two hour non-squirter for an interesting film. Really. You may think you are pretty smart. You may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure: an independent thinker championing a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep-like naysayers. Please dont. Youre embarrassing yourself. <br /><br />Revolvers a waste of everyones time. If you thought about if for a few minutes youd recognise it too. It was a waste of the cast a waste of the crew a waste of the caterers and definitely a waste of the precious minutes (you cant get them back you know) of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this unutterable wretched mess.<br /><br />No - wait comes a voice in the darkness. You just dont understand. Its NON-LINEAR. That means the story doesnt go in a STRAIGHT LINE. This is actually the COMPLEX and SUBTLE work of an AUTEUR. It addresses difficult EXISTENTIAL questions. And anyway - they slated FIGHT CLUB when it first came out - didnt you hear? -Because they couldnt deal with the COMPLEXITY. Theyre eating humble pie now. Bet you hate Lynch films too doncha? <br /><br />Hate to disappoint you but I am quite a big Lynch fan. I rather like Memento so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion doesnt necessarily fill me with fear. And although Ive only studied it briefly a few years ago philosophy interests me greatly. I dont dislike Revolver for these reasons. I dislike it because it purports to be about weighty big-brained topics but deals with them in such an insultingly superficial way as to be laughable. Im not much of a chess player but Richies idea of how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four year old. I dislike it because the characters without exception totally alienated me. Aha! cries the Richie apologist. Guy is cleverly tipping his hat to Brecht! Just maybe youre right. I think its more likely that he just cant write a decent script for toffee.<br /><br />Comparing Revolver with Fight Club is actually really instructive. Fight Club has acid-tongued nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. Revolver has stale fortune cookie reject one-liners that make your ears bleed. Fight Club has a great twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened. Revolver has as far as I can tell several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because... well they dont make sense. If you keep pulling the rug out from under people they eventually kick you out of their house. And then they lock all the doors and windows. And they never let you back in. Ever.<br /><br />Guy Richie seems to assume that being philosophical entails repeating a mantra of little buzz-phrases. Mostly they are spoken but often they flash up on the screen with attributions. Its almost pathological.<br /><br />But what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clichés in the world. Ultimately its so inconsequential. You dont care about anything. You dont understand anything. You go home.<br /><br />Actually there was a bit I really liked: the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence. Hes great. But I cant recommend you see the film just to see him. Hes only in it for a few minutes.<br /><br />Please believe me. Its horrible.',neg
'and nothing else.<br /><br />One of my friends bought the Problem Child Tantrum Pack (contains the first two Problem Childs in one disc) and we decided to watch the sequel because it was funnier.<br /><br />There were many funny moments in the movie (the vomit scene thats all I need to say.) Nippy the dog after eating CHOW DOWN and numerous others. The movie is nothing but toilet humor but its hilarious.

'This is a very rare film and probably the least known from Shirley Temple as it isnt on any of her collections.The reason why is probably because it doesnt have a happy endingunlike all her other films.Its also not a musicalalthough she does belt out one song called The world owes me a living.The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and whitethe version i have is in colour and on VHSi would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realisticunlike i would say the colourised films of Laurel And Hardy which are dreadful.The film is good for its age and the story hasnt dated at allIm surprised no one has tried to do a remake.At times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged out in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five.Although dont be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in itespecially when {Jerry}Gary Cooper steals a necklaceand hides it in Shirleys teddy bear.The tension and slow build up to his actions{while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room}is very well directed.Gary and Caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good.In all this is a good film from the early 30saccept it for its age.',pos
'I watched this film version of R.D. Blackmores classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 A&E version was released on video. And what a poor substitution it proved to be!!!!<br /><br />This version does not have the authentic I-feel-like-Im-there aspect of the A&E movie. The actors are for the most part wooden (with Sean Bean the exception) and the romance seems forced and contrived. In fact there is no kissing until the end of the movie!!!! The triangle between John Ridd Lorna Doone (or Lady Lorna Dugal whichever you prefer)and the evil Carver Doone isnt mentioned or expanded upon. We dont get much insight into Carver here or as to why he has some (if any) romantic feelings for Lorna. This movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel such as Counsellor Doone and Johns sharp-tongued youngest sister Lizzie which were crucial to the plot. The screenplay itself is lacking in conviction. The political intrigue also doesnt figure in the script. The way Lorna came into being with the Doones isnt true to the original story. Now dont get me wrong Clive Owen is a handsome and talented actor (watch Gosford Park and King Arthur for confirmation) but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout and long hair (it may have been a bad wig) just doesnt suit him!!!! Polly Walker is a lovely and accomplished actress (see Enchanted April and Patriot Games in which she also costarred with Sean Bean) but she appears colorless and lackluster. She has a cold sore on her lip that make-up cant hide and the costumes dont seem authentic. The late Robert Stephens does a respectable turn as Sir Ensor Doone although he only refers to Lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter which she was reputed to be in the book. Also it seems to me that Owen and Walker are too old for their roles (maybe its the make-up) and the scenery is brown cold gray and barren without so much of a hint of a sunny sky. I understand that it is set in Southwest England but it is green there and they do get their sunshine!!! The portrayal of Tom Faggus character and his death which doesnt happen in the novel depresses the film even more. The one positive note is Sean Beans performance as Carver. Although it doesnt even come close to matching Aidan Gillens portrayal in the A&E movie Bean does make one mean villain. In short watch this only if youve got a few hours to kill but dont expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel. See any other version ( but I highly recommend A&Es film) over this tired adaptation.',neg
'Quite simply the best reality show ever made. The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are on Hulu. I challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and not like it. I guarantee you will finish watching the season. Then I guarantee that you will watch season 2. <br /><br />Other quick reasons to watch it: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. The locations in Europe are awesome 3. The games are mentally challenging 4. Its very interactive 5.

'I too saw this film at a film festival but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and original. In a sea of terrible features shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting A.W.O.L however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to The Outer Limits. The performances are solid not that one would expect otherwise from Morse or McGinley and the directing is sharp and on the money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous posters comments with the film I saw. A.W.O.L is quite aptly written by Shane Black who as is usually the case plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously. All in all A.W.O.L proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film.',pos
'Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lees Shes Gotta Have It I have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress. She received an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatement.<br /><br />Here she simply shines as THE guiding force and hand in her community. This was especially poignant for me for I grew up in this very same time period. The production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed. She was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again. I first saw Macy Grays name in the credits and went ho-hum. Her performance was so good I didnt even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through. I am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in African-American culture that is very tastefully done.<br /><br />Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices.<br /><br />This is a worthy elegant presentation of African-American life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic. You owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection.<br /><br />I highly recommend.',pos
'This was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues. It dealt with issues of rascism and class. But it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself. This movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny. It also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society. What others think of you is not important. I believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it. The actors I think were able to convey each character wonderfully. I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was. At a just glancing look you wouldnt see how deep the movie is but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie.',pos

To further prove just how absolutely pointless this film was I would have liked to add a plot synopsis but I cant write fiction.

'Superficically Brigadoon is a very promising entertainment package. Gene Kelly and Vincente Minnelli the team behind An American in Paris are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations. Genes leading lady is Cyd Charisse one of the best dancers of 40s/50s cinema and unlike the generally superior Its Always Fair Weather this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances. Lerner and Loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as My Fair Lady and Minnellis musical masterpiece Gigi; Lerner and Minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent American in Paris.<br /><br />What happened along the way? Why is the movie itself such a stupid bore? Minnelli himself didnt want to do the movie despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with Lerner. Maybe it was because the movies innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for MGM and one step backward for Vincente Minnelli. But once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of Brigadoon are trapped within its city limits Minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting if not liberating way. The ultimate result is truly horrific to behold.<br /><br />While aiming for the naive charm of previous Minnelli hits like Cabin in the Sky and Meet Me in St. Louis the plaid-tights wearing inhabitants of Brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never-have-been locales. Its whimsy doesnt even match up to the glossy luster of Yolanda and the Thief or The Pirate because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions. The only people in Brigadoon who I at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow-traveler played by Van Johnson who accidentally shoots him. The general proceedings in the township of Brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of Christianity: they seem positively pagan in their aspect. For example in exchange for Brigadoons immortality the honorable and most generally good pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge.<br /><br />At one point were assured that everybodys looking for their own Brigadoon. Suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us arent looking for this kind of quasi-queasy paradise. The premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing but could work if the players were perfect. But Kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie and Charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as Lucille Bremer was miscast in Yolanda and the Thief. Van Johnson does his best version of the classic Oscar Levant sidekick to Kelly (even lighting 3 cigarettes at one point like Levant in AIP) and he provides a lot of amusing moments. But it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of MGM is a tossed-off Van Johnson performance.',neg
'Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers. This film opens with incest--and purposeless meaningless casual incest at that. Thats Greenaways big problem.

'I caught this movie on the Horror Channel and was quite impressed by the films Gothic atmosphere and tone. As a big fan of all things vampire related I am always happy to see a new variation of the vampire mythos in this case a ghoul-like creature residing in a Lovecraftian other dimension. The director has done a brilliant job of conveying the dark mood of the subject using the decadent art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a tale of love spanning time and space- the pure love of friendship opposed to the lust for blood and life by the vampires in the story. The characters in the story are transported to another dimension by the means of a mind-altering substance where a shape-shifting vampire creature appears to grant them their hearts desires whilst draining them of their life essence. There are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I enjoyed watching the 2 main male characters in the story Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich who were very attractive hunks always a plus point in a vampire story for the female viewers! The special effects make up and creature effects were well done and the set design of the vampires dimension was very effective. All in all an enjoyable take on vampire myths and recommended for anyone who likes their vampires with some intelligence and not just action. The only thing missing to make it even better would have been a bit more eroticism and nudity as it would have suited the plot and themes.',pos

'If you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a RAF Lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of May 1945 is somewhat unlikely since German air defences were as lively as Adolph Hitler on that day but this isnt a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and I guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy . In fact youd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect  beauty and soul of Powell and Pressburgers masterpiece . The scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today ? Again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made . RAF bomber command lost 58000 men during the war  the same number that America lost in Nam but during a shorter period and a far  far smaller pool of active combatants  theres no atheists in a fox hole and I doubt if youd lost a relative during the conflict youd view material atheism as being a sensible thing . When Richar Attenboroughs young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didnt survive the war . Also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939-45 there seems to be very few people from Germany passing through the pearly gates . its obvious Nazis dont go to heaven <br /><br />The plot itself where dashing young pilot Peter Carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldnt have had much appeal to me if it wasnt for the subtext  you see A MATTER OR LIFE AND DEATH is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the British empire as its replaced by American ambitions . Theres little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of American history and culture . One is the ethnic mix of America  even today many Britons think that the USA is overwhelmingly composed of White Anglo Saxon Protestants when in fact only 51\% of Americans are  White European  . The film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess  I am an American  as Peter is judged by Abraham Farlan  an Anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by British forces in The American War Of Independence . As for the  special relationship  between Britain and America - What special relationship ? Powell and Pressburger know their history when it comes to Britain and America . They obviously know their future too <br /><br />So remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present . Its strange  beautiful  poignant and clever but most of all its a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years . Can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a British soldier killed in Iraq ?',pos
'Tweaked a little bit Nothing could be a childrens film. Its a very clever concept touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes and goes against pretty much every Hollywood convention you can think of...what goes against everything more than literally nothing? Nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives. All thats left is what they dont hate and a big empty white space. Its hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot. It focuses on pretty much one subject but thats prime Vincenzo Natali territory. If youve seen Cube you know already that he tends to like that type of situation. The nothing in this movie is apparently infinite space but Natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic if only because theres literally nothing else and nowhere else to go. The actors sell it although you can tell these guys are friends anyway. Two actors from Cube return here (Worth and Kazan) but are entirely different characters. They change throughout the story and while theyre not the strongest actors in the world theyre at least believable.<br /><br />The reason I say this could be a childrens film under the right tweaks is because aside from a few f-bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids. So I find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore especially considering there isnt very much of it. This couldve gotten a PG rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue. There is very little objectionable about this film but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it. I only say thats a shame because not because I support censorship but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure.<br /><br />At any rate this is a reasonably entertaining film albeit with a few dragged-out scenes. But for literally being about nothing and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film.',pos

'This film is an excellent military movie. It may not be an excellent Hollywood Movie but that does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment but that is not the case with this movie. Other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste but  as a retired Soldier  I appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted. The story itself has been told and retold several times over but it remains for a professional soldier  and an African American at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew and as it presents the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashears work to become a Navy Diver and his life as a Navy Diver beyond his graduation is not the only story that is presented. There I also the story of how Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday defied the illegal order of his Commanding Officer that Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did and paid the price of a loss of one Stripe and a change of assignment. It also told the true story how Brashear found the third Hydrogen Bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950s and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if Brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself. This was a complex story that was worth telling and I will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story and I can tell from the deleted scenes on the DVD that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible. As a professional soldier I was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner.',pos
'I never saw the original 1954 version with Judy Garland so have no means of comparison. Also its been some years but I found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating. The movie tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a worn out disillusioned rock star on the decline embarking upon a romance with a fresh talented new singing sensation Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline.<br /><br />The lead actors Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand are adequate in their roles but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me. The film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect Streisands beautiful rendition of the Oscar winning song Evergreen. She truly has a powerful and magnificent voice.',neg

'ATTENTION SPOILER!<br /><br />Many people told me that «Planet of the Apes» was Tim Burtons worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film. So I decided not to see it. Another friend of mine who hadnt seen the movie yet advised me to watch it in spite of this because `a Tim-Burton-movie is still a Tim-Burton-movie. I decided to do it and I found that he was right.<br /><br />Its clear that a remake of such a famous film as `Planet of the Apes is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. Still Tim Burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as `Beetlejuice or `Batman. If you are already fond of Burton-movies its hard not to like one of his films even if it has some flaws: nerve-racking monkey squeals over-dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been without difficulties replaced by anbody else.<br /><br />What the film gives us in the first place is an answer to the question: Whats the result when Tim Burton is instructed to create a remake? First of all Burton wouldnt be Burton if he wouldnt refuse to call it a remake from the start; its a `re-imagining. On the other hand Burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring Charlton Heston (as human) and he knows that a remake doesnt exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared. So all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film e. g. by referencing to quotes. Concerning the story-line Burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with  AND HERE IS THE SPOILER  Leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever. <br /><br />Now this is the burtonesque answer to peoples expectations they hold because of the astonishing shocking ending of the first `Planet of the Apes. An ending even more unexpected more astonishing and: completely confusing because  and here Im disagreeing with various `Planet of the Apes-homepages and -platforms  it does not make any sense. There cannot be a meaning to it or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective. Tim Burton is playing his cruel games he does it with a grin and he does it well. Burton fans will sure like it others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism. Well and I dont think producers will ever ask Burton to direct a remake again',pos
'When Uwe Boll cinema con man extraordinaire released the first House Of The Dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to contemplate making a sequel. Hollywoods per-capita ratio of morons must indeed be high for not only do we have a sequel it was distributed in the antipodes by Sony a company not normally known for its taste in expensive write-offs. Released direct to television in America the sequel does improve on the original in most respects but in so doing it becomes bland rather than interesting. The scale of the scenario is enlarged with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead have been occurring. In particular the action is spread throughout the university where the first infected denizens can be found. Put simply the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be found.<br /><br />The cast on the other hand is a real step backward. Emmanuelle Vaugier was specifically made up to resemble a low-rent Angelina Jolie while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming-it Jürgen Prochnow. In fact the only name that will stand out among this cast is one Sticky Fingaz who probably did not want to be recognised that easily by the people he faces at home. Put simply these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen even under the best direction. Say what you will about Boll but he at least inspired actors like Ona Grauer to fight against his ineptitude. That said the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they might as well have some fun with it. Much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was crafting some kind of misunderstood masterpiece and he took himself seriously. Unfortunately with the actors failing to take their characters or the predicament seriously what little dramatic tension there could have been is undermined.<br /><br />Much of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation-zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise. Or to translate into more practical terms they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans. How this would help when a non-mutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine is anyones guess but the manner in which this quest is paced out suffers problems of its own. The we-have-to-go-back plot device is used in order to pad out the running time but the actual timing of the extra quest is also problematic. We are told at one point that the town will be obliterated by Cruise missiles in ten minutes yet the heroes drive back into the university locate the sample they are looking for and fight off enough zombies to eat the army of China all in this space of time. Filmmakers take note: it only pays to be specific with time when it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tension.<br /><br />The special effects used in House Of The Dead 2 leave those of the original in the dust. Where Uwe Boll simulated the deaths of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks Michael Hurst instead uses all the graphic details his budget can allow. Necks are bitten arms are cut off heads are shot. It all makes for a much more convincing throughput but it also disallows the mockery of obvious fakery. The photography is also much improved. As DVD Crypt put it the fact that it is in focus throughout makes it an improvement upon the original but this also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of. The writing is also both an improvement and a setback. Throughout the script references to other horror and survival horror games the most obvious being Run Like Hell are offered. The first couple of times they work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary everyday dialogue. After the eighth time however they just get on the nerves because they remind gamers of things they would prefer to do with their time.<br /><br />Interestingly House Of The Dead 2 cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across America. Given that Tom Savini on his own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays I have to say I am somewhat impressed with the visual results. In contrast to the much-reviled original the zombies here look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly. In a further contrast to the original the actors appear to have a clue what they are doing. Sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real zingers scattered throughout the characters speak like real people. However the story is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times already. When Aliens the real Dawn Of The Dead or The Evil Dead were released to acclaim the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before or did it so well that we did not really care. House Of The Dead 2 is competent enough that we do not mock it but it brings nothing new or particularly brilliant to the table so we end up not caring either.<br /><br />For that reason and many others I gave House Of The Dead 2 a two out of ten. It is too good to be bad but too bad to be any good. Unless you are into sucky films as much as I am you are best to steer clear of it.',neg
'I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch proved to critics that he has the talent style and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that hes become known for in the past decade. As much as the film is G-rated its pure Lynch in style pacing and tone. The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power.<br /><br />The cinematography is terrific as is to be expected from a Lynch film and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking. Its also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either good or evil.<br /><br />Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role.<br /><br />With this film David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80s with Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man. Critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and Lost Highway but with this film he showed that there was method to FWWM and LH and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film Mulholland Drive considering the high praise its received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch.<br /><br />Straight Story is to me one of the most moving motion pictures Ive ever seen. Its a loving story about family friendship and the kindness of strangers. I would highly recommend it.',pos
'666: The Child starts as a plane crashes the only survivor of flight 666 was a young boy named Donald (Boo Boo Stewart) who is adopted by news reporter Erika (Sarah Lieving) & her cameraman husband Scott Lawson (Adam Vincent) after they covered the incident for Channel 6 news. At first Donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around after warnings from a Nun & Vicar Scott begins to believe that Donald is evil & the cause of all the deaths...<br /><br />This straight-to-DVD horror flick was directed by Jake Perez under the pseudonym Jake Jackson & one has to say 666: The Child is really rather poor. Whenever I see The Asylum is responsible for a film I get worried I get very worried since their track record is awful. They seem to specialise in making &/or distributing low budget horror films which are usually rip-offs of some recent successful big budget horror film & in the case of 666: The Child you dont need a degree in rocket science to realise that its a complete rip-off to cash in on the recent The Omen (2006) which was released the same year. The script by Benjamin Henry & Austin Laurel is terrible & simply cant match the ambitions of the the Hollywood equivalent I mean just what exactly does Donald the Antichrist expect to achieve from a middle class family in a small town? Its hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of thew world is it? Every character in 666: The Child is some form of the main characters from The Omen the adopted parents the Priest who tries to warn them & the sinister babysitter. Theres a real lack of incident theres barely any gore & the plot is poor. I mean Donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random & needless what were all the disgusting pictures Donald drew all about where did the babysitter come from & theres just nothing that ties everything together & its just a disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly. The references to the number 6 also becomes annoying & are very unsubtle.<br /><br />Director Perez does alright I suppose its competent if nothing else. Theres virtually no blood or gore theres a few sprays of blood a cut off hand & someone gets a circular saw stuck in their face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on screen. Its certainly not scary theres no atmosphere thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting in a suburban house & theres no tension because we never really know what Donald is trying to do & there fore theres no threat from him.<br /><br />Technically the film is alright its reasonably well made but since the actual film is so poor it makes little difference. The acting isnt that great but at the same time Ive seen worse.<br /><br />666: The Child is a poor mans The Omen rip-off Id sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week. Not good & definitely not recommended. Followed by the sequel 666: The Beast (2007) which also went straight-to-DVD.',neg
'BRIEF ENCOUNTER is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 David Lean classic which was based on Noel Cowards play Still Life. A doctor removes a particle of grit from a womans eye at a railway station he is in a miserable relationship she is happily married social worker of Italian ancestry. They meet by accident on another occasion form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every Wednesday. The pair fall in love but after spending a few afternoons together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part. Cowards original one-act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton two Super Stars and veterans of Hollywood Epics are nobodys idea of ordinary people. Loren in particular is miscast - Sophia Loren in full make-up looking like a million dollars working as a part-time voluntary social worker at a Citizen Advice Bureau just doesnt ring true. Burton looking haggard with dyed hair too much make-up and wearing platform shoes doesnt come across as your average General Practitioner. That said you cant really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings penning poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt. Lorens husband Jack Hedley potters around the house all day and is terminally boring: the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous. Their final scene together will induce nausea (Youve been a long long way away etc.). That great British jobbing actor John LeMesurier has a three minute cameo as Burtons friend and appears to be slightly inebriated speaking his lines in a barely audible voice. Its a sad and forgettable performance in a dismal awful rehash of a cinema classic. Avoid at all costs.',neg
'Its kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece. I am not a dullard as far as quality films go and I will agree that from a technical filming standpoint as well as for several of the characters portrayed the film is in an award-worthy class. But there is no sense (for me) of this film actually going anywhere; I mean taking the viewer anywhere. It is a series of mood scenes perhaps remarkable as such but I want more from a film. I look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival none of which did I find in this film. Yes it might be considered poetry on film . . . but there is much poetry that I cannot live with for the same reason: that it paints pictures without going anywhere.<br /><br />One thing further to be said is that it documents a mid-century English childhood which is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally appalled at what a young British boy had to live through in that time and place. Having grown up in America just a decade earlier I can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense. I cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably. In other words could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its filmic magic (which I acknowledge is there) and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of ones actual recalled experience?',neg
'Well...now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his House of 1000 Corpses crapfest I can now rest in peace. Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in The House of Seven Corpses but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot (ha!) anyway to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! In Hell House (sorry I dont remember the actual name of the residence) a bunch of mysterious unexplained deaths took place long ago; some like arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine (whose small role provides the films only worthwhile moments) attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum. The result comes across like Satans School for Girls (catchy title; made-for-TV production values; intriguing plot) crossed with Children Shouldnt Play With Dead Things (low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead); trouble is its nowhere near as entertaining or fun. The House of Seven Corpses is dead at frame one and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis dragging us along for every aching second...',neg
'The war in the Eastas the Germans referred to the WW2 Soviet-Nazi conflict was a war of annihilation on the part of the Germany. 90\% of the German army were in the Soviet Union fighting.

'Christian Duguay directed this tidy little espionage thriller early in his career. It plays on TV pretty regularly albeit with some terrific scenes of violence and sex unfortunately trimmed. I finally got around to seeing the theatrical version on a $3 tape from the local video store. Naval officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to impersonate the notorious Carlos the Jackal and gets a little too caught up in the role. Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley play Quinns superiors with Sutherland a true zealot and Kingsley as the more level-headed one. The first half of this fun flick shows Quinn being trained and indoctrinated. The second half has him out in the field making love to the Jackals woman and shooting it out with sundry enemies. The idea is to make the Jackal look like a turncoat to the Russians and let them take care of the worlds most notorious assassin. Things dont exactly play out as planned. At times I almost expected the cast to break out laughing at some of the corny dialogue but they all play it very straight. In the end this is one terrific little thriller that deserves your attention. The Jackals former mistress teaching the highly proper and very married Quinn to rough her up lick blood from her face and then go down on her alone is worth the price of admission.',pos
'I enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love-hate relations along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline. All the main characters are well cast. True John Wayne or Robert Mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well but Victor Mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling Tarzan of sorts. Reminds me of his film role as Samson another difficult but not impossible man to tame.<br /><br />The mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts. This story supposedly takes place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War. Judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene(probably Mt. Lassen) the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the Cascades as we never see any other civilians. However there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort is the namesake of a very famous Sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie(eastern Wyoming)is mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort. The plains tribe of Assiniboines is mentioning as joining Red Cloud. This aspect of the story then bears a general resemblance to historical fact.<br /><br />It may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of John Fords Fort Apache. In both cases we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with Native American problems. He underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career. In both films he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy.. Also in common the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local Native Americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do. In both films we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commanders heart and a subordinate which the commander does everything to squelch. Clearly the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion.<br /><br />I also see certain resemblances with The Misfits. The soldiers as a whole including the commander are misfits of a sort((as one of them admits): mostly they have problems or are raw recruits with no experience fighting Native Americans. The commanders wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort thus is inherently a misfit with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army. The trappers in turn are also misfits not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent army-generated antagonism by Red Cloud. <br /><br />Finally we can also compare this story with Anthony Manns later film The Far Country starring Jimmy Stewart. In Stewarts case he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy at the end. But Matures character doesnt come up with an appetizing new way of being his own boss. Red Cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate. Besides he has an obsession with the Commanders wife.',pos
'The Women (2008) by Diane English is sadly such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning Candice Bergen Bette Midler Cloris Leachman whom I like and enjoy in everything Ive seen them and Meg Ryan Jada Pinkett Smith Debra Messing and Eva Mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at how could the movie be boring predictable embarrassing sloppy and simply bad? It was made by Diane English who is known as the writer of the very successful TV show Murphy Brown and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script. The movie has been a labor of love for English who had tried for many years to make it happen and I respect that. I even found the scenes with the supporting players Bergen Leechaman Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos funny smart and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand Sex and the City which was released few months ago. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw it but next to The Women it was simply brilliant. At least Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospitals delivery room where one of the characters was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. Poor Debra Messing what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we the viewers together with her? The movies like The Women give the whole genre chick flicks a bad name. It is nothing wrong with the genre but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships about dealing with marriage motherhood and proving yourself professionally? These are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to. Why making movies with the lines dialogs and situations so clichéd predictable not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over?<br /><br />After I saw the new movie I checked out from my local library the original The Women and I truly enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago and kept my interest all the way. The old movie had a real star power.',neg
'When I first got wind of this picture it was just called Shepherd and was supposed to be the film that would put JCVD back into chances of doing theatrical shtuff. I was very well excited about the whole piece.<br /><br />By the time it was titled The Shepherd: Border Patrol I was tap-dancing in excitement for this flick. With Isaac Fluorentine at the helm of directing and JJ Perry pulling stunt coordination I almost peed me pants in anticipation. Pics were released of JCVD kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as Scott Adkins playing what I thought was the villain and I was mind-blown in excitement. I thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuade.<br /><br />Then it came out. I ordered it off Blockbuster online for $20 and was ready for anything. The reviews from vandammefan.net kinda had my ideas alittle altered but I braced myself. The mail came on day 4 and I ripped open the package. My initial plan was to rush upstairs rip the face off the cardboard packaging then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my DVD player. However I stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film.<br /><br />By the time it was over I was cool as a fool in the pool. The Shepherd is certainly one of my all-time favorite direct-to-video films ever and makes Derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is. Sure some of the fights ran a twee bit short but they were still VERY awesome. The shootouts were superb as was Scott Adkins who SHOULD have been the villain unlike the forgettable Steven Lord.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flick. Seriously.',pos

'Watching CBSs Surrender Dorothy I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it (not because its a television movie--with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses it isnt any wonder why Academy Award winning performers such as Keaton turn to TV--but because it offers no opportunities for Keaton to shine). A single mother grieving the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter imposes upon--and gradually becomes friends with--the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid. Aside from being coarse and dim these phony people are incredibly unconvincing as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside (one young man who wears muscle shirts to tell us hes gay hears Diane Keaton say Surrender Dorothy and actually asks Thats from The Wizard of Oz right?...no genius its from Citizen Kane!). Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death. She tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage (lots of kooky outfits) but it doesnt sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way. Here shes a crazed harpy who doesnt learn many lessons on her journey of self-discovery (the movie quickly forgets its about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her). This is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat It should help a lot of grieving mothers out there. I cant imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer muddled and baffling. Its deranged.',neg
'This ones a romp; many Trek fans dont rate this as high as the well-known all-time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones but this one is so well executed for what it is so successful as pure entertainment it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes no matter what mood Im in. Several well known future movies (Westworld) and TV shows (the more bland Fantasy Island) took their cue from the premise of this episode (then of course the TNG show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology). Beautifully filmed (especially evident in the restored version and on DVD) and directed it takes place in the nice park-like setting of a planet which the Enterprise has just arrived to. Its odd that no animal life even insects seems to exist here (how are flowers pollinated for example) but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past (Kirk has a people-heavy past it turns out) as well as figures from other well-known fantasy stories. Sulu even finds an old-style police revolver (adding to his collection of swords no doubt).<br /><br />By this point in the Trek series (halfway thru the first season) the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends wed come to know over the many proceeding years. Here we get to really see them relax converse and work together to figure out this episodes puzzle: the strong narrative is a mystery again of sorts and the audience is along for the ride as Kirk & friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them. Its almost whimsical following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as Kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue (the Enterprise had its suggested just completed a harrowing mission). Then Dr. McCoy is killed by a knight on horseback; yes this is Dr. McCoys final episode...just kidding. But its no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story. McCoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and like the best Trek episodes the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic more desperate tempo of action and suspense. This is all signaled by Kirks resolute response to Sulu who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after McCoys death - Kirk will get to the bottom of all this come what may.<br /><br />But it doesnt get much easier for Kirk: what follows is probably the longest staged mano-a-mano fight for the series as Kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet. Yet this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness with another of Kirks past acquaintances. This episode runs the gamut of all human experience rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet. Its gratifying that the script really does explain all of whats happened as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy & sci-fi series with similar plot lines (unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there). And there actually is a subtext to the story - that we humans need to work off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion or we just dont function in a normal natural way. Also note the appearance of the very cute Yeoman Barrows and the sudden absence of Yeoman Rand who did not return until the first Trek movie in 79. I believe that after this episode even more Trek fans couldnt wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters. But I leave this episode with a final perhaps tantalizing thought: if McCoy was killed (verified by Spock) how do we know it was our real McCoy who beamed back up to the ship? Perhaps this explains why this McCoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with Data.',pos

'The phenomenon Helge Schneider defies easy description or quick categorization. Yet for the international audience not acquainted to him one could say hes something like a crude mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman adding a foible for Jazz music and 70s outfits. While his stage performances already are eccentric his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous.<br /><br />00 Schneider is in my opinion Helges best movie. He stars in the two leading roles - police detective Kommissar 00 Schneider and murderer-villain Nihil Baxter and also in a precious smaller role as physician Dr. Hasenbein.<br /><br />In the opening scene we see how modern-art-loving Baxter accidentally kills the circus clown Bratislav Metulskie from whom he has bought a malfunctioning used Jaguar when a beloved sculpture slips out of Baxters hands fatally hitting Metulskie. Upon reading about the incident in the newspaper 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick Lt. Koerschgen who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name. They pick up Baxters track quickly and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion (one of the movies best scenes!) but initially fail to gather any proof. The story winds through many turns with several scenes that dont always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny such as a daydream by 00 (including the most unusual view on a running mans brief-clad crotch in movie history) a police-department party during which Koerschgen gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized and a visit at the already mentioned Dr. Hasenbeins. Baxter then is finally caught attempting to escape to Rio de Janeiro on a plane.<br /><br />Always worth special mention is Andreas Kunze who in this case plays 00s wife as hes usually appearing in drag performing womens roles in Helges Movies.<br /><br />So all you folks out there looking for new laughs I strongly recommend this movie. The catch? You have to understand German (as I doubt theres an English version around)...',pos

'Things to Come is an early Sci-Fi film that shows an imagined world or Everytown through 100 years. You can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the Boss wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again after Everytown was bombed and war broke out.<br /><br />This film only has about 3 faults: its audio is muddy and video had some quirks the characters arent deep at all and the overall plot isnt altogether solid. The plot is lacking something that I cant put my finger on... it just seems a little fluffy. But if you love sci-fi and are interested in what H.G. Wells though might happened in the next hundred years this is a must see. Its worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing: a long drawn-out war because they were just about to go to war with Germany and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything.<br /><br />Things to Come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once.',pos
'i just finished watching Dressed to Killwhich is written and directed by Brian De Palma.the DVD had both theR rated version and the unrated version.i chose the unrated version.since i have yet to view the R rated versioni cant be completely sure of the difference.there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version.i guess you could call this scene soft core porn.if this sort of thing may offend youi would suggest you view the R rated version.but i digress.Any comment from here on refers to the unrated version.this is a murder mystery/ psychological horror/suspense movie.there is very little violence and blood.there is however one death sequence of note.the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic.however the blood it self does not look real.it is reminiscent of how a 70s slasher film would look.i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itselfto give the scene a low budget feel.most of the violenceor rather possibility of suchis implied.the film is very well paced.as far as i can tell every scene had a purposewhich i find very rare when compared to many of todays films. anywayi also thought the acting was goodespecially Angie Dickinson.and Micheal Cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his rolewhich works brilliantly in this case.the movie also has one great twist in itin my mindalthough some people might find it predictable.the only complaint(and its really more of an observation)i have is that i thought the character played by Nancy Allen could have been fleshed out moreespecially considering she has a fair amount of screen time.but i think she does a good job with what she is given.and this doesnt really take away from the quality of the film.the film also has a strong moral to itwhich is even more relevant today.but the movie doesnt hit you over the head with it.i also really liked the musical scorecomposed by Pino Dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original Psycho.to methis music really elevated the movie.i thought this movie was brilliant.for meDressed to Kill(1980)is 10/10',pos
'This extremely weak Australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the Pavlov Dog Experiment amongst horror movies. You remember this famous Conditioned Reflex experiment from your school books right? The Russian scientist Pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animals reflexes. Pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and after a while he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell. What the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low-budgeted Aussie slasher flick I hear you think? Well the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in Nightmares is an exact variant on Pavlovs experiment. Each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window because he/she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims. So this means that after a short while inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass. That way they still dont miss anything special! <br /><br />Regarding the quality of Nightmares as a film I can be very brief. This is a cheap uninspired and largely imbecilic Aussie cash-in on the contemporary popular trend of American slasher movies. In the early 60s a four-year-old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident. Twenty years later the same girl  Helen Selleck  is a successful stage actress but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares. She auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part. Shortly after the big premiere everyone whos even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered. It is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killers identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already. I dont think Ive ever seen a more obvious whodunit than Nightmares and the creators should have just showed his/her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment. The murders are explicit and very bloody and theres also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to enjoy. However the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative. The few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage. The only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do. Nightmares is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema but hey at least I gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible.',neg
'So Angela has grown up and gotten therapy and an operation to turn her into a real life daughter rather than the son that she was born and now holds a job as - wait for it - a camp counselor! How appropriate right? I know I love it. Anyway the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise obeys all the rules of horror sequels - more blood more imaginative killings (which arent imaginative but still more so than the original) more nudity a more elaborate plot and generally worse than the original. <br /><br />It is entertaining in the same way as the original was in that the characters and wardrobes are so goofy and so authentically 80s that you cant help getting a good laugh. At one point a guy asks Angela out and she says Ill call you and then quickly walks away. The guy says to himself How is she gonna call me? I dont have a phone! and then he sniffs his armpits wondering what turned her off (its the hair dude!!).<br /><br />It is a well-known fact that in 80s slasher movies the murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior usually for being too promiscuous. When I first started getting into horror movies and saw the Friday the 13th movies for the first time in the mid 90s I didnt realize this. I learned it in a film class a year or two later and was amazed that their was some method to the madness. I was pretty impressed not only that the movies were passing on some kind of message albeit a morbid one but that there was actually some thought put into it.<br /><br />But not in this movie! At one point just before Angela kills one of her victims she says Let this be a lesson to you. Say no to drugs! Real subtle screen writing there guys. Then again the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie. Angela (who by the way went through all that therapy and those operations and all that trouble to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well-developed person and then changed her name from Angela to umm Angela) says at one point I dont like being the wicked witch of the west but I know what happens when things get out of control. (People start getting killed...by me! HA!)<br /><br />Then later she demands that one of the counselors Mare make an apology to which the girl replies Id rather die! Sorry Mare but you really walked into that one...<br /><br />Two years ago I was a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie (except the camp that I taught at had more than three kids to the 15 or 20 counselors and it also had rules which the one in the movie doesnt). This made me notice the myriad of discrepancies in the movie from what camp life is really like. <br /><br />Thats okay though you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9 year olds running around although there were some 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie. I hadnt seen that kind of thing much before. <br /><br />Definitely bad taste even for a cheesy 80s slasher movie....',neg
'I watched the entire movie recognizing the participation of William Hurt Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. Im glad that I had no idea of the presence of Peter Weller. At the end of the movie I said THAT was Peter Weller? Kudos to Mr. Weller for an outstanding performance. Weller played a major character and his performance was such that I didnt even recognize him.<br /><br />Overall the plot was bad the writing was bad and the performances aside from those of Nosbusch and Weller were subpar. The scenery and setting were interesting and Weller was amazing.<br /><br />4 stars of a possible 10.',neg

'One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way: <br /><br />I was working in Roger Cormans offices like so many other wanabees before and since I was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman Roger Cormans wife and a producer in her own right asked me to load up a tape. Im not sure why she wanted to watch it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show reel something like that some sort of calling card. Whatever the reasons she had to see it the only free video machine in the offices at the time happened to be in the room I was working in and I was the nearest person to the machine. I started the tape.<br /><br />Fade in: On screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera. Behind him screen left was a door that opened into the room. Against the far wall was a coat rack. A second character entered through the door and started talking. The first character the guy at the desk turned round to reply (this is all one take static camera there are no cuts pans or dolly shots. Just one locked off camera). The second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line. Julie Corman said Ive seen enough. and left the room.<br /><br />What she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines? Nope sorry. Next! Thats how long youve got. Ten seconds. Cock it up in the opening shot and you are dead.<br /><br />I was reminded of that moment while I watched the opening of this piece of crap. After an interminably long travelogue of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into cages. A man carrying a gun laughs. A jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal. God this is boring! Cut to the interior of the Airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut to a different angle of the two men -<br /><br />- and the director crosses the line.<br /><br />The first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up. Not Crossing The line is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience. Audiences dont like to be confused. Mystified? Baffled? Puzzled and intrigued? Yes. Audiences love all of those. Confused? No. You loose them. They walk out. Not Crossing The line is one of those things they pound into you at film school or should. Its basic stuff. Its not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules) directors break it all the time - but not on the first real cut of the movie.<br /><br />I thought Ive seen enough. And switched off.',neg
'If it would of had Jack Black listed as the leading actor I would of stayed away from this movie right away. It actually makes some of his movies look good compared to this movie.This movie should of been filmed as a cartoon for ages 3-8 and it would of been a lot better. It is nothing but a bunch of the stupidest skits from other movies put together to make one big mess.The movie looks like it was shot in about one day with no thought at all behind it. Theres a few times where it looks like maybe theres gonna be a turning point and the movie well actually have plot to the movie or at least a storyline would develop but the stupid skits inserted just ruin the whole movie.',neg
'Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X--a powerful force to be used for atomic power. Unfortunately Rukh has been contaminated by the Radium and starts to glow in the dark--and his touch causes instant death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote--but Rukh starts to go mad due to the Radium AND the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him.<br /><br />The plot is silly and the effects that make Karloff glow in the dark are laughable but this is still a fun little chiller. It moves quickly has some great atmosphere (notice Rukhs house and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. There is also good acting by Franic Drake (as Rukhs wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So its OK but just a notch below all the other Karloff/Lugosi movies. The plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow. Still I did like this. I give it a 7.',pos
'My first Columbo. Rather enjoyed it. Great format and Peter Falks character extremely good...wonderfully quirky he can take his place next to Poirot Miss Marple and also the likes of Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series has such a following. <br /><br />As a professional musician I HAVE to say a few things. First of all a conductor who merely produces these pedestrian performances of the most basic examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik Strauss Waltzes Beethoven...) is never going to have a house like that or fame like that or cars like that much less be called a genius. And the conducting that the actor does is so bad as to be laughable. No orchestra would take him seriously. <br /><br />There are several little things too such as his rehearsal of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (why rehearse it when theyve just performed it for TV? Any orchestral musician would be able to play it in his or her sleep anyway...). His instructions to the ensemble are downright nonsensical and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what quasi fantasia means she says its Latin. Its Italian as are the vast majority of musical instructions. <br /><br />And finally no two great musicians would EVER have the following interchange: Play something. What should I play? Chopin. Music is their job and passion they know it well. Something far more specific would be asked for and offered! <br /><br />I know. I should get out more...',pos
'This is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last. This time the spoof is mainly on The Ring Signs and 8 Mile for some weird reason. In my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny. I laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two but this one was just plain dumb. If your jokes consist of corpses getting beat up and people constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you. In my opinion if your smart enough stay at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies they just keep getting worse 3/10.',neg
'...a true geek-girls dream: high tech high drama smart guys steamy sex and large explosions. (VERY large explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that tapes of the REAL Oppenheimer sound odd: apparently he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the 20th centurys most stirring dramas and this movie stands as a model of what docu-drama ought to be: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record not to call attention to themselves. An interesting fact: some of the technical details used had only recently been declassified and so are of special interest. A must-see!',pos
'The events of September 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two French brothers. In my view it would have been better to leave this out. I think the directors tried too hard perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop. The comment of one of a policemen - this aint f***ing Disneyworld is apt.<br /><br />Nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events. The filmakers were in all the right places at the right times no other footage from the day matches what they shot.',pos
'I saw this movie and the play and I have to add that this was the most touching story that I had ever seen. Until I saw this movie I was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults that were and are living in that era. It brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive And to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing. This simply surpass a five star I rate it a ten. Thank You Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such a astonishing story. Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told it is still one that lays heavy in my heart.If there is a VHS or DVD out there on the play Please notify me ASAP.Thank You. PS There was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance.',pos
'From 36 Chowringhee Lane to 15 Park Avenue Aparna Sen has indeed traveled a long way. If the first one goes down in history as a débutants clean sweep the latter will definitely carve a special place as a mature film. Until you see 15 Park Avenue you cannot imagine feeling thrilled and moved at the same time. Thrilled to see the directors ingenuity and agility in portraying seriously challenging situations and moved by the sensitivity echoing throughout the film. It is not a movie that merely makes you feel tchh tchh how difficult life must be for schizophrenics but makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality that you see and believe. Sen has done a brilliant job in highlighting this supreme fact of our existence that we all are in some way or other trying to live in a make-believe world of our own trying to run after mirages called happiness peace contentment. Along with the depiction of a delusional mind Sens magic has brought forth many little nuances of human relationships as they sustain stress and strain. The fact that at times we all lose calm break down make wrong choices be haunted by guilt behave selfishly and so on is captured with extreme adroitness by Sen. She showed the cruel dilemma which Shabana had to deal with all her life of having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and kids for herself. And in the act of always being beside her sister always being a strong persona providing support making judgments and so on she unknowingly cut off some of the oxygen that her sister needed to bloom. Isnt this a very harsh truth that at times in an attempt to do the best for someone we strangle their assertiveness and end up hurting their self-esteem? Of course Konkonas and Shabanas acting deserves laurels as always because had the ingredients not been so good the dish could not have turned out to be so extraordinary. Aparna Sen once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who crave for some food-for-thought . Bravo !',pos
'Oh Geez... There are so many other films I want to see out there... I got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and this is what he wanted - Yeah...<br /><br />I used to watch this show when I was in college...it was mindless kinda fun and somewhat action-oriented. The show had a good heart tho...and the characters were cute; no one ever got killed or even hurt badly... it was like a cartoon come to life. Cut to 2005...What happened? This one doesnt work. As others have said there simply isnt a cohesive story and the performances are weird...almost annoying - definitely not faithful to the original characters...the whole thing is a like a Mad TV skit and it lasts over 100 minutes! This was one of the few times Ive been EMBARRASSED watching a film. What were they thinking? As best I can tell mustve been for the product marketing toys etc. All I can say is let this one die a quick death. It makes the original Dukes of Hazzard seem like Masterpiece Theater...<br /><br />I think the only remake left to do from TV is Gilligans Island... Good Luck!',neg
'Might contain spoilers.<br /><br />This is just a good movie. Lots of good silly stuff to laugh at. However do not watch the TV version they cut to much out. Dom Deluise is rather awesome as the mafia Don who is hired to kill Robin. All I can say about his ten minutes: its a long drive from Jersey. Also you gotta love them checking the script to make sure Robin gets another shot. Also: 12th Century Fox.<br /><br />Any bad stuff? The rappers at the beginning and the end seem rather out dated. The songs were rather lame. One time while watching this movie I could think out a few more times when they could have thrown in another joke or 2. <br /><br />On the whole however an enjoyable movie experience. A must watch for comedy fans.',pos
'Not sure why this film was advertised as a wild quirky laugh filled comedy. There is not much in this movie that will entertain nor amuse the moviegoer. Annette Bening (whose acting was touted as being Oscar worthy) comes off here as mannered with her performance seeming routine. Brian Coxs character is confusing and irritating and the lead playing Augusten  Joseph Cross  appears to simply not have the personality to carry his role. The best thing about the film is Evan Rachel Wood but she is not enough to endorse this boring unsavory film.<br /><br />The film disappeared quickly and it seems with good reason. I found some of the scenes distasteful (the scene with Brian Cox and his just utilized toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in You and Me and Everyone We Know and The Squid and the Whale) some embarrassing and most of them unsettling. I found the whole experience a waste of time. Dont you waste your time',neg
'Superb and charming. Justin Henry is beautiful as a blissed out and mischievous Howard Kaylan lead singer for the top ten hit making band The Turtles.

Not many films unbelievably so can find the essence of a special moment in a life and times. Id like to see this available at any home video retail outlet without any hassle.

'Ponyo written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki is a little tale that speaks of respect for the ocean respect for humans young and old and respect for cultural differences. It is a new tale of a little goldfish wishing to be a girl rather than a retelling of Disneys Little Mermaid. Miyazaki has animated by hand a whimsical magical film for the young and the young-at- heart. The film begins with a slow undulating blue-green palette of sea anemones jellyfish and scores of little fanciful goldfish with childlike faces. There isnt any need for narrative the motion of the creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi tell the beginning. Released last summer in Japan Ponyo won the Japanese Academys award for Best Animation Film and Best Score (Jezebel.com). The fanciful little goldfish Brunhild leaves her ocean home on a jellyfish. Upon reaching the surface she is caught up in a fishing net full of other fish garbage and sludge. She is propelled into a jar which is rolled to shore where five-year-old Sosuke (voice by Frankie Jonas) retrieves it. He cuts his hand when breaking the jar open to free the little goldfish. Brunhild tastes his blood which heals Sosukes cut and puts in motion her transformation to a human at the same time throwing nature out of balance. Sosuke puts the little goldfish in a green pail and names her Ponyo (Noah Cyrus) meaning soft and jelly like. Sosukes mother Lisa (Tina Fey) lets him take Ponyo to school which is right next door to the nursing home where she works. Lisas crazy driving down the picturesque winding road past a dry dock through the bustling fishing town and up a tree-lined road to the nursing home is representative of Miyazakis wonderful sequence of action and illustrates perfectly a parents hectic morning. Miyazaki has created another strong independent female character in Lisa. Making her a loving sensible modern mother both to Sosuke and Ponyo. Lisas telephone conversation with the not-coming-home-again husband Kiochi (Matt Damon) because the ship he captains must make another run is a typical wifes reaction. Later that evening Sosuke intercedes using a signal lamp to speak to his father as the ship passes the cliff their house sits on. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochis apology and jumps up and signals Bug-off Bug-off Bug-off it is a hilarious scene. But when Sosuke takes the signal lamp and tells his dad Good Luck Love You Lisa hugs him and tells him he has a good heart it is a very poignant scene.<br /><br />My personal favorites are Miyazakis elderly granny-type women in wheelchairs at the nursing home Yochi (Betty White) Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their interchange over Sosukes little goldfish is wonderful and reminiscent of the bickering between the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they trudge up a long flight of stairs in Howls Moving Castle. Ponyos magical sea-god father Fujimoto (Liam Neeson) resembling the wizard Howl arrives to take Ponyo back to her ocean home. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try and put nature back in balance but magical little Ponyo escapes again upsetting more elixir in the process and causing a tsunami. Running on the backs of giant dolphins to get to Sosuke this redheaded little girl reminds the audience of the stubborn adventurous little Mei in My Neighbor Totoro. Ponyo is just as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo has done he calls for Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett) the Goddess of the ocean to help with the situation. This wise calming Goddess arrives in a blue flowing garment that never ends. She has a private talk with Lisa discussing the future of the young children which helps the audience understand Sosuke and Ponyos relationship is not that of lovers but of brother and sister. The life-goes-on quiet simple ending is typical of Miyazaki films leaving the audience full of hope.',pos
'The Kite Runner is one of the most controversial films of the year and its not just one of those controversies invented by PR people to sell tickets. No this is a film that was actually pulled from release because the producers began to fear for their safety of their actors. That may give you an idea of just how sensitive and topical some of the material is. The Kite Runner is an important film for our modern world because now more than ever we need stories that show the reality of war not just action movies that glamorize the violence. It was adapted from the best-selling book and some critics have charged that something was lost in translation but if you dont bring the baggage of the novel into the screening you will be very moved.',pos

Fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action lead of the 80s Roundtrees small part is a far cry from his Shaft days and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career one to sit right next to his laughable turn in The Toolbox Murders (this man was a respected actor once now he has come down to wearing flowers in his hair and complaining about people bleeding on his carpet). Only Stack Pierce acts with some dignity. As for the violence dont worry: most of it is too badly done to offend anyone. (*1/2)',neg
'THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most movergoers were stay-at-homes watching their new 7 Motorola televisions. Almost all recent box office figures are false --- because they fail to adjust inflation. Obviously todays $10 movies will dominate. In 1951 it cost 90c to $1.60 at Radio City; 44c to 75c first run at Loews Palace in Washington DC or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs. What counts is the number of people responding to the picture not unadjusted box office media spin. The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of Enrico Caruso (really not a great story anyway) and threw it in the trash. Instead 90\% of the movies focus was on the music. Thus MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA doing the music of the best-ever historic opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. The result was a wonderful movie. Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating. Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE Edmund Purdom took his place --- with Lanzas voice dubbed in and with the formerly handsome and not-fat Lanza pictured in the advertising. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO its almost always on eBay for $2.00 or less. Dont be put off by the low price as it reflects only the easy availability of copies not the quality of the movie.',pos
'When the US entered World War I the government forced Hollywood to churn out propaganda films. THE LITTLE American is probably the best of the lot because it stars Mary Pickford.<br /><br />Pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French) but her decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlist.<br /><br />When the ship Pickford is sailing on is sunk by the Germans (think Lusitania) because it is carrying munitions Pickford has a great scene as she stands on the lifeboat and yells at the German commander. Later on of course she runs into both Holt and Hatton when she is being held as a war prisoner at a château.<br /><br />Director Cecil B. DeMille provides one truly great scene in this film as Pickford and Holt are wandering through a bombed-out village. They pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing. Against the wall is a very large crucifix. As they stand and watch the wall collapses but the Jesus figure remains suspended in mid air. Its a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and un-artsy.<br /><br />Pickford is as always a pleasure to watch. She was always a very natural actress who avoided the arm-waving histrionics many other actors of the day used. Shes also very very pretty. Holt is very good here in a leading-man role. Hatton is OK. Among the list of name actors in extra parts are Wallace Beery Ramon Novarro Colleen Moore Ben Alexander Hobart Bosworth Norman Kerry Walter Long James Neill and Edythe Chapman.<br /><br />Not a great film but interesting to see US propaganda at work.',pos
'I have been a fervent Hal Hartley supporter since I saw his short Surviving Desire in high school and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant Henry Fool. But this 10-year-later sequel is not only unnecessary its disgraceful.<br /><br />After a choppy and expeditious start Fay Grim devolves into pseudo-intellectualism flat out boredom and finally unwarranted - and unwanted - nihilism. And thats just the plot.<br /><br />The majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly-developed as the movie: one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool himself and its his only spoken scene in the film!<br /><br />Jeff Goldblums Agent Fulbright it seems is the only bright character (a pun surely intended by Hartley as well). How then is he left? **SPOILER** Dead via a car bombing easily making this the gentle-natured Hartleys most violent film to date and tonally all wrong in a film thats already all wrong from the word go.<br /><br />As for the other new characters Angus James Ned Fool (or is it Grim?) not to mention Fay herself... well I wont spoil their fates as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own (when it isnt busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle which gives the disconcerting impression that Hartley is moving backwards from Auteur to crappy film student).<br /><br />This piece is a complete disaster a dreadful mess that isnt even good-humored enough to revel in its messiness. Instead it self-indulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the real world one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say. In doing so Hartley tracks sh*t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them.<br /><br />I have rarely been so depressed at the movies and Im counting Leaving Las Vegas which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them instead of immediately disregarding characters already beloved.<br /><br />Grim indeed.',neg
'The Vampire Bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise.<br /><br />The film is set in a European village sometime in the 19th Century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals. There is a very similar feel to James Whales Frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwills Dr Niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement.<br /><br />The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring by having suspicion fall on bat-loving village simpleton Herman (Dwight Frye) thus providing the excuse for a torch-wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed one.<br /><br />This is one of a trio of early horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-starred (also Doctor X and The Mystery of the Wax Museum) and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements. Taken in context though The Vampire Bat is still weak and derivative.<br /><br />All we are left with is a poor-quality Frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink Dracula fans. But for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director Frank Strayer was doing the Blondie films a few years later.',neg
'I saw this movie once a long time ago and I have no desire to ever see it again.<br /><br />This movie is about Preston Waters a hard-lucked preteen who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash. All this changes when a bank robber runs over Prestons bike and passes him a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $1 million from the bank (ironically the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). Preston then buys a mansion and says that hes working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). After that he just goes crazy with the money.<br /><br />On paper this sounds like a great idea. However on screen it is one of the emptiest movies Ive ever seen. For one thing its too unbelievable. I know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible but I draw the line at a twelve-year-old boy going out with a thirty-year-old woman and being put in charge of a imaginary persons small fortune. Also this was a shallow movie with weak acting a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable. The characters were either cheesy over the top annoying or underdeveloped. But Juice was a funny character.<br /><br />If youre looking for a good movie to watch with your family skip this one.',neg
'Arthur Miller certainly knows. His stories give a clearer picture of what it means to live in the United States in the 20th century than any other writer I can think of.<br /><br />Focus based on one of his novels is no exception.<br /><br />William H. Macy and Laura Dern give fantastic performances here. Emotionally bruising but ultimately rewarding this movie is excellent.',pos
'From its uninspiring title to the flat acting performances Curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout. The film has gained some fans by way of the fact that Quentin Tarantinos name is attached to it and the silly and out of place nod to the Rodriguez/Tarantino flick From Dusk till Dawn. These things do not make a great movie however and this is more than evident all the way through Curdled. The film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing. The Mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool but its becomes annoying very quickly; especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is Mexican it doesnt fit with the tone of the movie. The films plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who because of her obsession with grisly murders takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes. It sounds boring and it is.<br /><br />William Baldwin is the only name on the cast list and even he doesnt make an impression. He hasnt been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing hes pretty much wasted. Angela Jones or rather; the taxi driver from Pulp Fiction takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman and it is always clear that its her involvement with Pulp Fiction that won her this role not her acting ability. She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantinos masterpiece but she doesnt have the talent to lead a film by herself. She looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film and if it werent for her Latino accent; she wouldnt convince the audience that shes a weirdo on any level. Curdled is a one hundred percent-proof piece of forgettable trash. Films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics; but this one fails on all levels. Whether youre a Tarantino fan William Baldwin fan horror fan or just a movie buff; this is one to miss.',neg
'Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate. How insane the world is and the power of will and friendship love and passion. A must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever! Many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this!!',pos
'With Knightly and OTool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly maybe some tension. But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants. It was of course totally superficial beautiful English country and seaside or not.The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part. They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements.',neg
'and not in a fun-to-watch way. its just bad. its shocking that people have posted positive things about it here. the story sucks the acting is bad its not scary the special effects arent special--oh no! the blackboard has hands coming out of it! oh gee--the mirror turned into water! the hair clothes and makeup in the 50s scenes arent accurate and they got a middle-aged man with a receding hairline to play the high-school version of himself. this is like later-on nightmare on elm street stuff. i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else but there are better bad ones out there to choose from.',neg
'My Wife and Kids was billed as the 00s very own Cosby show- but unlike the latter it was unfunny and unwatchable. In fact it is so poorly written and some of the jokes revolve around Michael mickey taking Michael Jrs dumbness and the fact that he is such a loser- which got more and more tedious and annoying as the show went on.<br /><br />What was supposed to have been a promising hit eventually turned into a dumb silly show later on where the ideas became so OTT and ridiculous. And as for the second Claire i ended up disliking this character so much: she became a spoilt childish and moaning teenage brat in most of the later episodes.<br /><br />MWAK was no Cosby show trend setter rather it was just a poor black sitcom by general standards.',neg
'During my struggle to stay awake during this borefest I fought through my near-dosing off to discover some silly plot regarding fraternity schmucks quite incredibly obnoxiously annoying running into trouble with a psychotic  radioactively damaged half-human/half cyborg named Splatter who sends his soldiers after them for the murder of their prestigious politically vocal leader(..for whom Splatter killed himself setting them up to take the blame so he could become the leader). These face-painted freaks form a group who express their feelings anarchically though non-violently living on dilapidated streets abandoned by the civilized world voicing their concerns regarding nuclear disarmament. Anyways most of the film has these five frat goons running throughout darkened streets with graffiti walls as Splatter and his punks pursue them. Thankfully for these guys they find a punk chic to assist them on their journey out of this rather ugly terrain with which theyre unfamiliarized. This territory the frat guys are immersed is a veritable labyrinth of streets and alleys with the idea of an exit out most difficult particularly when crazies and Splatters bunch occupy nearly every turn.<br /><br />Yeah I was duped like others thanks to the HR Giger poster which is most excellent. If only he had been the designer of this dreck..this is not the case and we the viewer are left a film modeled after of all movies it seems Walter Hills THE WARRIORS except this film doesnt have the style or grit that film has. The film has a plethora of unfunny bits and lame confrontations between the frats and the punks with hand to hand combats often laughable. The setting is rather interesting and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light but its not the environment thats the problem..its the plot and characters within the environment that grow tiresome. The saddlebags under my eyes weighed heavier every minute this movie continued. Yes Texas CHAINSAW stars Edwin Neal(..quite a funny voice-man who has an entertaining interview on the DVD I rented for this flaming turd of a film)and Marilyn Burns have key roles as opposing members of their faction against the government resulting in the final conclusion within a building complex at the end. Neals character Splatter uses these metal spikes which emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims.',neg
'I love pop culture but I was a little apprehensive when I first heard about this. Then I seen an episode and I LOVE IT! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Eccelson would no longer be playing Doctor Who. He was probably the best one theyve had. He fits the character so well. Its sad to see him go. I really dont think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as Eccelson.<br /><br />I think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures such as the darleks. The story lines and characters can more than make up for that. Im currently waiting for season two and I will review that as well in case for any reason quality goes down.<br /><br />Anyways I think everyone should try to see one episode. I did and I have been loving it ever since. Well written well casted and well produced this show is worth the hour of viewing. Doctor Who gets a 10/10',pos
'I dont see how you can say that Freddys Nightmares is cheesy and a rip-off. You obviously dont know good TV when you see it. The episodes are packed with drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddys Nightmares and I hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night SpecialSchool Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series sucked then youre entitled to your opinion but remember its only your opinion and it means nothing. Freddys Nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and youll come to accept that fact soon enough. If you dont like it then dont watch it but dont deny its brilliance.',pos
'This is a low budget Roger Corman horror/creature flick. A DinoCroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. An engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping. None of the characters have any depth but then they are not the focal point. We only get a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best kill scenes in a small budget film.<br /><br />My favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself. Nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet. With no real stand out roles: Jane Longendecker Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter Costas Mandylor. I was most impressed with the alluring Joanna Pacula as the respectfully feared Dr. P. DINOCROC is redeeming as a crock of pickles.',neg
'I want very much to believe that the above quote (specifically the English subtitle translation) which was actually written not spoken in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner. But if so director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. They are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that I have to conclude Carax actually takes himself seriously here or else has so much disdain for everyone especially the viewing audience that he cant be bothered letting anyone in on the joke.<br /><br />Some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique bizarre films because they do so with élan and unique personal style (e.g. David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story (e.g. Krzysztof Kieslowski and David Cronenbergs later less bizarre works). In Pola X Carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. Well here it is: the pacing is erratic and choppy in particular continuity is often dispensed with; superfluous characters abound (e.g. the Gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are overwrought; the lighting is often poor particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason; and the list goes on.<br /><br />Not to be completely negative it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. I liked the musical score even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhols Factory of the 60s?). Much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. And even well into middle-age Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has it. Her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didnt sink into bathos.<br /><br />There was an earlier time when I would regard such films as Pola X more charitably. Experimentation is admirable even when the experiment doesnt work. But Carax tries nothing new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films and after several decades of movie-viewing and literally thousands of films later I simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal poorly crafted tripe. At this early moment in the 21st century one is left asking: With the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet are there *any* directors in France who know how to make a watchable movie anymore? Rating: 3/10.',neg
'Wow this was a great Italian ZOMBIE movie by two great directors Luci Fulci (ZOMBIE) and Bruno Mattie (HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD) Lucio started this movie and was ill so the great Bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than I expected it to turn out so if you have seen HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw ZOMBIE directed by Lucio Fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great ZOMBIE make-up witch equals great looking ZOMBIES has a funny ZOMBIE flying head!And ZOMBIE birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a ZOMBIE (That Only Happed To Two People) but they are mainly just the great toxic ZOMBIES like in Bruno Matties HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD.So if you like Italian ZOMBIE movies or just ZOMBIE movies in general than check this one out its a great Italian ZOMBIE movie!',pos
'Modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake The Money Pit. Older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia: Cary Grant Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all superstars in an easier less complicated era. Or was it? Time of course has a way of modifying perspectives and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older seemingly less provocative films. In Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House there may therefore be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948. There is political commentary however subtle. Finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience only lightly softened by the coming of Levittowns and the like. Politics in the movie? The Blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school (which in real life would get teachers accused of communism). In real life too Myrna Loy was a housing activist a Democrat and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no less a Democratic firebrand: he was married to congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas whom young Richard Nixon accused of being soft on communism (and which ruined her). Jason Robards sr. has a small role in the film but his political activism was no less noticeable. More importantly his son Jason Robards jr. would be for many years a very active liberal Democrat. Almost the odd fellow out was Cary Grant whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already slipping. But this was 1948: Communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner. It would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films and then not so subtly.',pos
'While the main story is supposed to take place in Morocco this movie was shot in foggy Romania in 18 days on a very tight budget. However broken their cards may be the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment so that in the end I found the result both touching and graceful. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy. The script and direction provide some gems. Whether you will like the movie or not however will probably depend on your take on Alexandra Staden in the title role. Other reviewers have pointed out Stadens inadequacies as Modesty Blaise. They may have a point but I found her interpretation delightful and very fitting. Modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline innate talent and courage. Staden appears to be doing the same here.',pos
'Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. All is in the cliché of the mentor and the talented immature pupil. The characters arent even interesting nor sympathetic. Artistically it is as empty and insignificant. The colours are very impersonal and light. Only the poster may be appealing. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. Too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate. But I cant have a complete comment on this movie any way as i got out from the theatre 20 minutes before ending. Everything was so predictable that it was a waist of time...',neg
'I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09.<br /><br />Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say I had hopes for Towelhead. Unfortunately it was a disappointment. In fact of countless movies Ive seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals Towelhead is the only Sundance movie Ive ever wanted to walk out early from.<br /><br />The worst problem with Towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of provocative concepts concerning cultural stereotypes rather than with an organic human drama. The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the authors political views. That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic. If there ever was a time when Towelheads white male villains condescending portrayals of blacks ironic treatments of foreign cultures etc. were fresh its long past.<br /><br />For a more detailed review please look up any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on.<br /><br />On the other hand the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled. As you read through the reviews in this and similar sites youll frequently come across superlatives: stunning breathtaking profound shocking ... It embarrasses me to read them but it does not surprise me. Indeed Ive encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial cultural gender or sexual issues as deeply moving thought provoking full of profound insight. If you are such a person by all means rent Towelhead and be moved by it. On the other hand if you set your standards higher you can safely pass on this one.',neg
'Caught this recently after noticing James Earl Jones name on the title. It was better than I expected. Of course its pretty old - made during the early/mid 70s but it actually is a decent drama. It runs a quick 90min or so and showcases good performances from James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll. The plot is conventional in general but told through the perspective of a single black woman on welfare who has 6 children and trying to deal with all the problems that persist. This makes for an interesting view.....also in the fact that the script wasnt too sentimental or overdramatized - its almost like looking at a slice of the past. All the 70s styles are out in abundance. The ending is kind of kooky though....probably wouldve done better without the theatrics.',pos
'Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It isnt Inglorious its disgusting.<br /><br />I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The entire point of a film is to entertain - if u call bashing peoples heads and removing their scalps entertaining!!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit it is extreme boredom or disgust.<br /><br />The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. There is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table before thankfully they are all shot. I wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F**K up.<br /><br />This table talk style is a Tarantino hallmark but in other films I actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. Here I couldnt care less. All of Quentins films display an enormous confidence particularly Jackie Brown. But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film.<br /><br />Is it violent? Sure theres torture and scalping galore but youd have to remind me. Thankfully the film was so thin I didnt even remember I had seen it earlier in the day when until I saw a review headline on MSNBC.<br /><br />Hes out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. But do us a favor QT and spare us the movie.<br /><br />I walked out of this movie halfway through and I would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is.<br /><br />I give it 0 / 10.',neg
'Gone With The Wind is one of the most overrated movies in history. It is a film loved by mothers grandmothers and shut-ins who go to the movies once every five years. As a zombie movie it blows. There isnt a shambling corpse in sight and its terribly light in the gore department. Zombie 3 on the other hand is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood-spilling -- therefore it is better than Gone With the Wind. It is also not overrated. Most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish. It is however not boring rubbish. After a terrorist steals a virus he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter and the chemicals leak into the ground. The terrorist who has been exposed to the nasty concoction hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh-eating zombie. One of his first victims is a cleaning lady. Once shes bitten Lucio Fulcis brand of hell breaks loose. As usual for a Fulci flick the acting is atrocious the storyline is riddled with plot holes and the gore is plentiful. Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is badly shot too poorly edited and the sound design is flat. Still it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing. Definitely worth picking up if youre an undead completest. Or dont like Gone With The Wind undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.',neg
'Its really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official truth and caught so many news agencies with their pants down. This movie in my view deserves every price there is in journalism - its objective (yes!) courageous and a real scoop. It can do without comment fake scenes or leading questions - everyone including Chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words. The filmmakers only had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling.<br /><br />The Venezuelan elite teaches us How to depose of a President and sell it as a victory of democracy. Its amazing that they lost in the end - so far. From what I know the biggest TV station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked theyre still broadcasting via cable and satellite. I highly doubt whether George W. or Barack Obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup. But then they dont have to worry.<br /><br />The fact that the Chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so-called free (established) media really has become or has always been only more so. An important lesson to anyone interested in what really goes on in the world.<br /><br />The famous objectivity challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse us - it has been true with the effects of the Atomic bomb the US secret history of spreading democracy around the world or the Iraq war that according to Johns Hopkins has killed 13 million Iraquis by now not to mention the 60000 Afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned. To be objective Saddam Hussein was less damaging to his people than the US. And the US is ready & willing to be more damaging to the Iranians that he was.<br /><br />Im quite curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague whether there will be any mention of our involvement in supporting and training Pol Pots guerrillas in the 80s when they had been largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not.<br /><br />All the more reason to turn to the Independent media for balance if not exposure of fraud.',pos
'At times I really wonder when I look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than I have. Ive just seen it... and liked it. Not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film!<br /><br />The film needs some patience yes. And yes the main character is REALLY annoying but that Im sure is by intention.<br /><br />Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home. Most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music. This movie definitely doesnt fit as background noise.<br /><br />And no. Good directing doesnt mean having five laughs or explosions a second. Good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together. And while that doesnt work out perfectly at least I think it works quite good.<br /><br />I liked the photography and sets even if they brink on the surreal at times. The opening scene is really special.<br /><br />I also liked the acting  Guillaume Depardieu is NOT playing Pierre. He is acting the role of a Pierre who is himself playing a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be he is a presumptuous and self-righteous idiot a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect. That even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself.<br /><br />People are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff: No character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone.<br /><br />And even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen: Remember that Isabelle fled from a war zone - and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war most likely Bosnia (which was still going on when the film was produced). At least thats what is hinted at by the story Isabelle tells Pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover which is surrounded by books on Bosnia.',pos

'Emma Woodhouse Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love Duets) has nothing to do with herself but painting going with her friends on her chariot up and down saying hello to people in town and trying to match make everybody she knows. I guess there were no movies no television in those days and the girls had nothing to do but gossip. I wish she had read a little more. I like Gwyneth and think that she is a lovely young woman. She is talented and in Emma one has the privilege to hear Gwyneth sing. I am looking forward to seeing Duets where she is suppose to sing. She is brave to speak British English with all those native Britons including Emma Thompsons sister Miss Bates Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral Dancing at Lughnasa). Mrs. Elton Juliet Stevenson (Truly Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American movie royalty being none other than the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsewhere) and Tony Award Winner Blythe Danner (The Myth of Fingerprints). She will hopefully be around for a real long time. Lucky us! I liked Emma and also recommend it. It is one of those old stories that are still accurate those days. Favorite scenes: Emma singing and playing the piano. I specially like it when she sings a duet. Favorite Quotes: Mr. Knightley: Emma you didnt ask me to contribute a riddle. Emma: Your entire personality is a riddle Mr. Knightley. I thought you overqualified. Miss Bates: It left us speechless quite speechless I tell you and we have not stopped talking of it since.',pos

'I watched this movie knowing that it would be awful but damned if it didnt break new and revolutionary ground in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment. The plot is Deep Rising with cruddy effects and HORRID acting. The lines in this...well...wow there really is no way to put this movie down because i think the words have yet to be created in the English language. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually making something good. You wont believe your eyes when you see how many movies they ripped off without even trying to hide it. There are scenes/plot devices straight out of Deep Rising Alien Jurassic Park Predator Jeepers Creepers and the list could go on forever. However unlike any of those movies this one just falls short of celluloid stool. The most incredulous thing about this film aside from the way it tries to be competent but fails is that Gimli him-freakin-self is in it. How the hell can they afford John Rhys-Davies but not decent effects writing actors or sets. Really awful...and not the type of bad thats good.',neg
'En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway) a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the womans husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short. And thats not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with Joe Haggerty as the tale-telling Ebenezer Jackson giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; theres a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well that beggars belief.<br /><br />To be fair some of Sykes creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and Joe Castros cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation. These positives just about make the film bearable but be warned The Zombie Chronicles aint a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10 but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didnt get to view the film with the benefit of 3D (although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldnt have made that much of a difference).',neg

For the film the character has been spiced up into an outback copper who uses his fists and isnt averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl though quite what she and the films other sex interest see in him I dont know; Taylor was 39 at the time and his face was getting puffy.<br /><br />But his characters stamina is remarkable; he flies in from Australia apparently goes straight to the Commissioners house (rather unwisely seeking to arrest him during a black-tie reception) saves him from assassination (getting into a fight in the process) goes to a casino with one girl leaves with another and takes her to bed. So much for jet lag! On the way back to the Commissioners house (showing a good knowledge of London back streets) he gets beaten up by the baddies but is still first down to breakfast! Its also remarkable that the commissioners limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise timekeeping of a clock-activated bomb.<br /><br />The best thing is Joseph the Butlers disdain for the uncouth Malone. And at least the film avoids being a London travelogue though some scenes take place during the Wimbledon tennis week.',neg
'This movie is horrible. THe acting is a waste basket. No crying no action hopeless songs. Though the scenery is great. I have always wanted to go to Greece.<br /><br />Anyway as for Saif youd expect a great performance but even he let down the people.<br /><br />Akshay Kumar recognized as the pimp of Bollywood and the voice of Singhs. He was sensational in this movie. For only this performance Filmfare should introduce another award. The toiletries award for the worst performance. By the way the trophy should be a toilet seat.<br /><br />Kareena Kapoor. She first of all is not comparable to her sister Karisma. In acting in looks or in body. She now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her. She comes into this movie wearing bikinis and tank tops and short shorts. I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan is letting his wife-to-be dress like that. But she mustve impressed some people dressing like that. And if you ask how then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie. They are dreaming of having Kareena Kapoor in bed naked with a condom. Including me. Personally I think that she dressed like a whore but I really liked it.<br /><br />I am forced to give it a 1/10 but Id really give this movie a 0/10. An unachieved film.',neg
'Its hard to believe that with a cast as strong as this one has that this movie can be such a dud. Its such an incredibly horrible film. How was it ever made? How did so many good actors wind up in such a terrible film? Dont waste your life. Dont watch even one moment of this film.',neg

'If the only sex youve ever had is with a farm animal then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading.<br /><br />This is by far one of the most boring movies Ive had the pleasure to try and watch lately. I found the DVD lying around at my friends house and I made the sad mistake of not burning it.<br /><br />I am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie. Just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-span.<br /><br />I think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie but I was unable to tell exactly what it was after I gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at Richard Gere.',neg
'Stanley Kubrick a director who I hold in the highest of esteems for his masterpieces (Clockwork Orange 2001 The Killing the Shining Dr. Strangelove etc) took the film out of circulation leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and completists. After seeing the film for myself I could see why. At the age of 24 Kubrick had already honed his craft of still photography for LOOK magazine and had done a few short documentaries. Like many first-time filmmakers that came in the decades after him his ambition for Fear and Desire was in short to just go and make a film cheaply more than likely to see if he could do it. On that level he was successful. However the film itself definitely is not.<br /><br />I cant really say that the film is a failure because there was something I did like about it throughout. Even as the films story went on the wayside and the actors (whom Kubrick didnt have any idea how to direct not being a man of the theater) his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its seeds in this film. At times there are some shots of close-ups and quick-shots in suspense/action scenes that are eye-catching. Unfortunately this is all the good I can really say of the film. Although there are a couple of name actors in the film (Frank Slivera who also appeared in Killers Kiss and Paul Mazursky a director in his own right) the performances overall are dull and very routine.<br /><br />In fact that is the films main demise for me; whenever I watch any Kubrick film even his early film noirs Killers Kiss and the Killing I can tell who made it as his style by then became distinct which would continue as he evolved as an artist. It wasnt artsy like I might have pictured (which is usually the case with first-time directors like Scorsese and Spielberg) but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasnt Kubrick it felt like a lot of the time I was watching some B (or even C) grade movie by a director that time forgot- not quite Ed Wood bad but close. The music is as standard as can be the fades are pedestrian and the plot seems to not really hold that much attention.<br /><br />In short as others have said and which I can agree this is a doodle pad of a future ground-breaker who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention (the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage) but not enough to really recommend except to those like myself who end up seeing everything by Kubrick (or perhaps have to see every ultra-low budget war film ever made) if only out of curiosity.',neg
'I did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a Welles box set I had recently purchased. A box set I chiefly got because I wanted to own A Man For All Seasons and to also re-evaluate Waterloo. So I stick Orson and Rita in the player and Im treated to class and confusion in equal measure.<br /><br />On the surface the story seemed a simple one man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband and then.............<br /><br />..well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans. Michael OHara (Orson Welles} himself doesnt really know what is going on he is as confused as the viewer is and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film. Obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth} has its moments but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped.<br /><br />So many wonderful things in the film it has Welles visual style all over it see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye. The narration from OHara is joyously self mocking and we get good light relief by way of a court case with Everett Sloane considerably lighting up proceedings.<br /><br />Yet the film is an oddity and in fact its a choppy viewing experience because {as I was to find out after} studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer but unfair on Welles vision. Im positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale as it is tho we have a very good and intriguing film one that sadly only hints at greatness but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that Im glad I own to revisit further. 8.5/10',pos
'I think the movie was one sided I watched it recently and find the documentary typical of western movie makers that was biased without substance. The fact is prostitution do exist everywhere in the world not in Tanzania alone and not because of this fish business there prostitutes were there way before the Russian and other business people arrived in Mwanza. Poverty is indeed endemic in Africa let alone Tanzania and this is not because of fish fillet business in fact the fish industry has helped millions to support their families on their daily life. This movie just tarnish the good image of this peace loving country. As for the arms trade the film could not substantiate if there is any truth in that indeed looking critically at the films one is doubting the authenticity of the film maker it seems that their trying to prove their point by using a few characters which can be done for anything really. Yes Tanzania is a poor country yes there are prostitutes and street children but they are not the product this business it is just a common scenario in most poor countries indeed the world over even in the western world...What a load of rubbish.<br /><br />The pilot themselves are talking of sending weapons to Angola which is more than 2000km south of Tanzania and the war was in DRC also miles away from Mwanza the director could not give evidence how these weapons were transported from Mwanza to DRC!<br /><br />In short the films lacks focus and respectability it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in Africa and has nothing to do Darwins nightmare or fish fillet...What a load of rubbish!<br /><br />The truth is the Nile perch has not decimated all other species in the lake contrary to what the movie portrays and also less than 25\% of all catches from lake Victoria are exported the rest is consumed locally so lets get that one right.',neg
'This is one of the funniest movies Ive seen in ages. I watched for about 20 minutes slightly puzzled by what was going on. Then I started to laugh and didnt stop til long after the movie ended. Such deadpan satire is rare indeed. Christopher Guest has a true eye for the humor inherent in those who have no sense of humor about themselves (about 90\% of white heterosexual males to start with). As in Waiting for Guffman Guest nails middle Americas idiotic self-importance to the wall. I can hardly wait for his next film.',pos
'Pat Conroys autobiographical book The Water Is Wide proves to be something of a Southern Up The Down Staircase yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula Conrack really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews an amazing performer) plays the tough nut Conrack has to crack and once she falls under his charms it all seems a breeze. But the story is not ready-made for a happy ending and I wasnt prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale. Its beautifully done. The script veers off course every now and then but director Martin Ritt is very smart to always fall back on Jon Voights solid presence. Scenes such as the one where he drives around in his van venting his frustrations over a loudspeaker dont add up to much but the whole film is filled with episodes which spark emotion and the actual ending is their payoff. **1/2 out of ****',pos

'Im a fan of C&C going back to their records and liked this movie but at one point in the mid-1980s on cable television in San Jose California it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie. All references to marijuana were replaced with diamonds. The bag that Red drops to Chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana but the conversation still remains the same (...its worth ~$3000/lb). There is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing C&C and talking to each other about getting the diamonds. At the end instead of space coke its something else. Im not sure who created this version but it was horrible and obvious that they were attempting to make it family/child friendly. It would have been better if that network had not aired it at all.',pos
'The following review is one from the wrong side of the tracks meaning two things: You will hear nothing but praises coming from me and dont be fooled by my rating. I also could tell you that this review contains no spoilers but technically... thats a lie.<br /><br />Well... Screw the review. Im just going to ramble a bit. It has been a while since I had so much fun with such a bad film. And if you cannot enjoy this piece of utter drivel then you simply have no sense of humor. First off this movie was meant to be taken seriously and thats the main aspect were the fun is coming from. The story? A doctors son is terminally ill. Daddy-Doctor decides that a hart-transplant must be the only way of saving his son. So in true mad-doctor-style he decides that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick. Of course the gorilla-heart is much too potent for a human so sonny-boy transforms into this hideous Ape-Man that immediately breaks free and goes on a killing and raping spree (because thats simply what any horny beast would do isnt it?). The make-up of our Ape-Man is hilarious. Theres simply no other way of putting it: The guys face looks like a turd! Im talking human excrement here the solid brown kind! Beautiful! The gore in this flick is wonderful too: Aside from real footage of an open-heart surgery we also have incredibly fake (but quite nasty) looking blood & gore effects: a decapitation an eye-gouging a throat-ripping the scalping of someones skull... Its hilarious and indeed its quite incomprehensible why NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES ever made it to the notorious UK Video-Nasties list because all of the nasty things portrayed in this film are simply too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Oh and theres only one bloody ape running around in it too by the way. So needless to say that LA HORRIPILANTE BESTIA HUMANA is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and convincing tale of science gone horribly wrong.<br /><br />When not trying to shock with poorly staged acts of bloody violence or random portrayals of female nudity this movie manages to be highly entertaining with ingredients like nonsensical dialogues cheap cardboard sets plot stupidity and incredibly bad acting. Just a few random examples maybe? About the sets: One can clearly see that the set-designers just used the same walls doors windows (etc.) over and over again to be build various different interior sets (e.g.: One side of the hospital room - the window side - where the unconscious wrestling girl lies looks suspiciously similar like the window side of the basement-laboratory from where Ape-Man escapes; The set-designers also took one of the side-windows from the laboratory made it a bit larger and just placed it in the conference-room of the hospital; All the walls in any building are the same grey-ones;...). Then theres the setting of the park. Clearly shot in a studio you can see (on several occasions) that the grass is loose. Whenever theres some struggling/fighting/raping going on the grass just shifts and shuffles and you can see the grey concrete from the studio-floor beneath it.<br /><br />Just a few random lines that come out the actors mouths: <br /><br />-- In the conference-room where all the doctors are debating the disappearance of Unconscious Wrestling Girl (a disappearance that would of course mean bad publicity for the hospital) Daddy-Doctor intelligently utters We find ourselves in a situation that is difficult.<br /><br />-- During that same debate a colleague-doctor cleverly remarks A sleepwalker! Any sleepwalker gets up. hereby providing a solid excuse for the disappearance of Unconscious Wrestling Girl.<br /><br />-- After our investigating detective through the amazing process of his own logical deduction concludes and tells his superior that the murderer must be a half man/half beast his superior answers that its absurd adding the line Its more probable that of late more and more youre watching on your television many of those pictures of terror... Truly one of the best lines of the movie.<br /><br />Other sources of laughter: <br /><br />-- The two scenes were Daddy-Doctor and his Igor-like assistant kidnap the gorilla from the zoo and Unconscious Wrestling Girl from the hospital - these well thought-out acts of abduction are like taking candy from a baby.<br /><br />-- Daddy-Doctor speaks to God a lot doesnt he?<br /><br />-- Sonny-boy calling Daddy-Doctor Papa on more than one occasion.<br /><br />-- An old lady screaming Aaargh!!! A dead man! A dead Man! A Dead Man!! A DEAD MAN!!!.<br /><br />-- The plot periodically stops to wallow in scenes of women wrestling only to go on again and do nothing with that concept. Sure Daddy-Doctor replaces Sonny-Boys gorilla-heart a second time with that of Unconscious Wrestling Girl but do you think something spectacular happens after that? Like Ape-Turd-Man growing breasts or something trying to rape men this time? Our leading living wrestling beauty (Norma Lazareno) doesnt even go into a climactic wrestling contest with Ape-Turd-Man near the movies finale... But Ape-Turd-Man does start to show some motherly love near the end... almost (and I say almost) in true KING KONG-style (i.e. the top of a building and people on the ground pointing and screaming).<br /><br />Okay I think thats enough now. I chipped in more than my two cents here. Vomitrons Rational Rating for this sleazy piece of hilarious dreck: 2/10. Vomitrons rating From the Wrong Side of the Tracks: 8/10. Go see this film people. It is well worth it!',neg
'Caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for. Many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didnt like it as it was not what they wanted to see. The above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if youre a fan of the genre.<br /><br />It has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself. <br /><br />An absolute diamond a film i still have on video to this day.

'...intimate and specific. Yes a bit of a cinderella story but only after many convoluted turns earning its way deeper and deeper into Antwones psyche. Only superficial viewing can condemn this film as superficial. This is the stuff that heals nations this is one of our great national stories.

In his first directorial effort first of many I hope Denzel Washington confirms once again that he has a truly beautiful mind and soul.',pos
'Theres something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some Cheech And Chong material. One of the songs in Up In Smoke well I often wish more songs these days began that way. But in this excuse for a video the stoner duo are showing us the videos for four songs from their album of the moment also titled Get Out Of My Room. You hear a voice-over during the opening credits in which some anonymous producer describes the record as being a novelty recording that will just take up room on the charts. Unfortunately this opening voice-over hits the nail right on the head.<br /><br />Most music recordings endorsed by the RIAA seem to keep to a rule of putting the best material early in the album. Often when one gets past that first song the discerning listener notices that the recording has little if anything to hold their attention. Bands that defied mainstream convention on the other hand often saved their best material for last or at least spread it evenly throughout the disc. In this case Cheech And Chong appear to have decided to hedge their bets. The opening piece Get Out Of My Room is a hilariously-themed song with an incredibly bad video. Many a viewer of a 1980s music video will find the sloppy direction somewhat nostalgic. Cheechs conception of British punk is also incredibly funny.<br /><br />Where it all goes downhill is the second number Im Not Home Right Now. Nothing kills interest in a song quite like repetition and its tough to get more repetitive than this aural turd. Honestly one feels the urge to slap Cheech in the face and tell him that we get the idea he isnt home right now so please move on. The next song along the theme of love being a strange thing is the absolute rock bottom not only for this collection but for Cheech And Chong in general. Its almost as if this song was made for the sole reason of padding out the albums running time.<br /><br />Fortunately the stoner duo saved the best for last but it is also curious to note that Chong is completely absent from this cut. Born In East L.A. is a simple number based upon the old Bruce Springsteen number that mocks Reagans view of multiculturalism. As one is regaled by Cheechs tale one has to wonder how many poor schleps who couldnt speak a word of Spanish were deported to Mexico simply because their skin wasnt bedsheet-white. Racism was an integral part of Americas culture in 1985 and it remains so today. If anything it has gotten worse so one has to wonder what Born In East L.A. would be like if it were written in the current era.<br /><br />Unfortunately two cuts does not an album make especially when there is so much boring filler between them. The interviews before Get Out Of My Room for example are quite funny. Not side-splitting like much of Up In Smoke but funny enough to justify their existence. Unfortunately the two middle songs are reflected in their making-of footage. Boring song makes boring filler. If you cut out the middle half-hour of material from this video youd have something substantially better.<br /><br />I gave Get Out Of My Room a three out of ten. They are earned by the first and last video. Im pretty certain that the stars look at material like this today and wonder what they were thinking.',neg
'After hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is I took the plunge and bought the DVD. That said everything previously mentioned about this film is true. For a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all. The list of problems with the film could drag on forever. Chief amongst them is the film is simply too long. It dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours. Nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly. <br /><br />Secondly as many had pointed out from the trailers the special effects are anything but special. The tripods looked OK in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade-Z 1970s or 1980s quality. Probably the worst effects of all were the horses which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved. The heat ray effects were laughable as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles. Also pitiful was the Thunderchild sequence in which the Thunderchild described in the book as an ironclad ram looked nothing of the sort. Instead it resembled a World War 1 era destroyer complete with deck guns (which fired but had no visible crew) and torpedo tubes. <br /><br />The colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects. Most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out Mars to her in the sky. Well the sky is black but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight. There is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape bathed in full sunlight and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars. To detract even further the color of the scenes made no sense. In some they are bathed in orange light. In others green light. In still others its blue light. In some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue. The frame-rate and camera is very shaky giving everything a stuttering look.<br /><br />Finally the acting is overall sub-par. One man portrays two characters whos sole difference was one lacked a mustache. This led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were. The English accents even to American ears are outrageous. <br /><br />In summary this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times. I have not seen Gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one because of its poor quality in every respect must easily be worse then anything that mainstream Hollywood has put out. I would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom 10 or 20 in the IMDb rankings. Its a pity that Mystery Science Theater is not still around.',neg
'Im surprised with the questions and issues this documentary has brought up in the reviews here specially because theyre indeed interesting questions. Surely the ones who could best address it would be the makers of the film themselves. Nevertheless I think I can shed some light upon something that I think has been overlooked which is in my opinion the purpose of the film what it is about and what its trying to convey. Whats its message after all? At the risk of pointing out the very obvious Ill start saying the filmmakers have an intention. Theyre trying to tell a story extract meaning out of it and get a point across. With this in mind we can shoot down many of the criticized points particularly the ones involving what people expected in contrast with what the filmmakers were really trying to show. Causes and consequences of violence? The film is not about that. Its not enlightening Non-Brazilian audiences about the Brazilian favelas issue? Well who wanted to do that? Is AfroReggae this or that and supported by whom? It doesnt matter in this context. Not enough women in the film for your tastes? Its not about equality or the feminist cause. Every little detail about Andersons life mother son family and all the aspects and the workings of the AfroReggae movement? Well dont be so picky because it doesnt matter. Theres just so much length a story can have before it cant become a film anymore. If the authors were to show everything everyone is expecting theyd have to make a 6 months TV series instead. If you are expecting all that you approach the film the wrong way.<br /><br />The film is actually about two individuals who started a movement. Two individuals full of ideals. Two individuals who thirst for change. Two individuals trying to do something about all the wrongdoing going around them. Individuals who went rock bottom and wanted to get up again. Its all about finding purpose in life drawing inspiration from misery changing the destiny and becoming something else than what they were destined to be -- criminals and drug dealers for that matter. Its about achievement and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro though its an integral part of the film given thats what the characters are constantly surrounded by. Unexpectedly and not without a reason the film ends up centered much more on Andersons course through difficulties in life. This is because they were faced with Andersons accident while they were shooting the film. Im not sure about this but they may have even seriously considered ending the filming right there leaving behind all effort spent. But Anderson wanted to keep going. And so they did risking to lose in having a film with a bit of an identity crisis considering the sudden change of course but gaining in showing someone overcoming such a devastating happening. Its very evident for who watches it that the film begins about AfroReggae and winds up about Anderson. Its very unique in this sense (the shift of the story line). Maybe their only sin is not making it evident upfront which may initially rise expectations that will go unfulfilled.<br /><br />As for the importance or ordinariness of Anderson Id say not everybody wants to change the whole world end all violence feed all the hungry be like Mahatma Ghandi be as known as Mother Teresa or whoever other known personalities there are. Its much easier to relate to and draw inspiration from someone who is such as everybody else in fact trying to transform his or her own harsh life raising problematic kids coping with permanent injuries or diseases and even managing to pay the bills by the end of the month. To understand the movie you have to see thats about leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime making up for it and trying to persuade others not to go down the same troublesome path. Though you can criticize if the way they chose to do it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method you cannot deny their intentions.<br /><br />Also the perception that Anderson is special or a chosen one may have partially something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they were depicting. As much as becoming friends with them. Theres no way it wouldnt tint the whole movie with a more favorable light over Anderson. If a dear friend becomes paralyzed in an accident its not just a fact you make a big deal out of it. And this is not necessarily bad. Its not much that they treat him like a chosen one as much as they go to great lengths trying to show him as a seed for transformation and source of inspiration.<br /><br />In conclusion dont watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime it contains watch it for what it is much more an inspirational story.<br /><br />Nike-Ad-like? Seems just damn good and professionally made to me and doesnt affect or detract from the intentions of the film. Romanticized? Speculate on its credential as a documentary if you will but why not when its supposed to cause reaction and inspire? Isnt trying to better peoples lives through music and dance -- the essence of what the subjects are trying to do -- romanticizing the very own reality? Pardon me but showing just the plain facts is what reporters do and you can watch it on TV every night.<br /><br />If I wanted to become a filmmaker I wish my first film would also be this great.',pos
'Humm an Italian movie starred by David hasselhoff and Linda Blair I wasn´t expecting very much to be honest and in fact I took even less than I was expecting. It doesn´t mean this movie is the worst I have seen because I have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this. Apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad. Now I only want to watch Troll 3 by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that.',neg
'Now I havent read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here so Im not going to go down that path here.<br /><br />But I have some time ago learnt that Stephen King movies simply -are not- horror films with perhaps a couple of exceptions. This was not one of them. It started well enough and for once Im not going to complain about the acting although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonderful.. Also I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills as they were necessary to make the story here move forward...<br /><br />But there was one consistent point that I couldnt help but get annoyed with. And that came pretty close to the end of the movie and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity. The moments I refer to are thus: There is a tiny zombie running around the house. You suspect it is under the bed. Do you <br /><br />(a) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you or <br /><br />(b) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety or at least see the mini terror coming at you giving you a little reaction time.<br /><br />I know lets go with (a). I feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today. Bleh<br /><br />Fun enough film though... Just not very scary.',neg
'I had read the newspaper reviews of this film and I must say my expectations were very low before watching Oceans 12. I really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. I would rate it top 5 of the worst movie I have ever seen. Why do I say that? First of all there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be assigned the term story is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive. The entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times.<br /><br />The actors show up but doesnt do anything to deserve any credit or appraise. Most embarrassing are leading ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) that either overplay or are extremely plain. Damon Clooney and Pitt arent brilliant either. To be honest I really dont understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie.<br /><br />=== May contains spoilers ==== Camera and editing sigh where should I begin. There are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful. Combine that with extremely untactful editing and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out. Especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car. The camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - NOT. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess. Bruce Willis. Why? Please explain it to me! WHY???<br /><br />To summarize ... if you have to choose between root canal work and watching Oceans 12 I recommend the former. Make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it ...',neg

Some examples would be Riding With Death(the most hysterically cheesy of the lot) Stranded in Space(confusing and uninteresting) San Francisco International(horribly dull and unbelievably confusing) and this turgid bit of Quinn Martin glamor. <br /><br />Shot in Hawaii(although you wouldnt know it from the outside shots) its apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show. The real problem is that you don;t like most of the characters including the drab main character Diamond Head who seemed half asleep for the entire movie; his boss Aunt Mary who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on; Diamnd Heads girlfriend/fellow agent(hell I cant even remember her name) a skinny wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting; and the singing sidekick Zulu(again i cant remember his characters name)who wasnt bad in small doses. The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops. Alothugh the make-up jobs this so-called chameleon used to disguise himself were just laughable. I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a South American Dictator cum American General. Nor do I care. The plot simply wasnt interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on. Just call this one - Hawaii Five No!',neg
'No just kidding. It was God-awful.<br /><br />I was watching my local Sci-fi station last night which plays movies every night within a monthly theme. This month its Space Turkeys Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bombs. Movies so bad they should never have been made. This was a good selection.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions the gore make-up (which showed potential) and the editing (which slightly out did the rest of the movie in terms of being horrible). The acting is horrible all around the dialog is horrible the script the direction. Its not a good movie.<br /><br />It consists of two forms of special effects gore and stock footage of space. Ill focus on the gore. Watching this movie I thought to myself What WAS the motivation behind the making of this movie? People like making stuff sure but I was hesitant to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved. I came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the Make-up Effects guys Demo Reel. He (Rick Baker) actually went on to a pretty nice career hes worked on STAR WARS (1977) KING KONG (1976) MEN IN BLACK (1996) and even THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981) plus a number of other notable flicks. Other than that I cant say Ive ever actually SEEN a real live melting man - incredible or otherwise - but Id have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of one.<br /><br />Now when I think of bad editing I usually think of maybe a scene where someones talking on the phone and then in the middle of the scene the phone jumps down to his shoulder or something to that effect. This movie really serves to highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms. Specifically over-long and utterly useless scenes. Just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have from a little bit of dead air to that crazy-long screaming scene with Cleaver Girl. And that severed head in the river the head gets thrown into a river (in slow motion) the movie carries on for a couple minutes and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a waterfall. While Im sure they were all very proud of their severed head WHAT THE HELL??<br /><br />Lastly Ill mention the running fat lady/slow motion scene right near the beginning. The jerky slow motion tells me that they didnt shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it wasnt working like that and then slowed it down. Oy vey. In any event if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed glass door - all in slow motion mind you - remember THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN for *this* is where it all started.<br /><br />Movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends. This ones a little slow most of the time but thats just all the more time to come up with your own one-liners. Its not the worst of the worst but its pretty freaking bad.',neg
'i expected it to be good after id seen some other ozons superb moments and read much about it... but this movie is brilliant - clever very bright (emotionally and visionally) perfect in all moments. every movement is there for a reason everything fits so closely and primordially true and honest. this is the movie about the beauty and innocence; about its simplicity.',pos
'This film is outstanding and wonderfully scored. Princes Oscar for music was richly deserved (many people dont know he won one). I think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A great surprise: Prince does a fine job acting and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera. Morris Day Wendy and Lisa are good in their supporting roles. Very cool landmark film.',pos
'Many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie (Gackt Hyde and Wang Lee Hom is very famous singer in Japan). But dont judge it before you watch is what I say. Gackt and staff are very serious when made this film and they worked so hard. Its a good film with a touchy story inside. Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. They made it so good until I cant stop watching this all over again. <br /><br />The story has written pretty well but I admit that their act are little disappointing. This is especially for Hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language (Japan). But its comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie.<br /><br />I think Gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life. When Toshi was killed when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che to being vampire like him because he wont let her die When Shos Brother died Kei Shoot Son die and the best and beautiful scene is When Sho pass away~ even I told that Hydes skill is still weird but I give him two thumps up at that scene!!<br /><br />Theres a time where The plot goes too fast like they didnt tell the reason Why Son can join the local mafia and being Shos enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also Son is Shos brother in law.<br /><br />Whatever I love this movie~ (very much ^^). <br /><br />This is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.',pos
'The Cell is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey about the world it shows during this journey the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact the story is pretty good.<br /><br />We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientist including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe that this method might work. Catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there in a world that is completely created by the boy. She hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results.<br /><br />The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent DOnofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI Agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are on this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that time after forensic research on the dumped body Carl can be traced and captured. Two problems occur. 1. Carl just went into a coma; he has been sick for a long time. 2. His house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place. In a way this part of the story is pretty standard.<br /><br />Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is Catherine has to go into Carls mind. This is dangerous for a lot of reasons. In short: Carl is unknown territory schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine starts believing Carls mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body; she could die in the mind of Carl. A tape of how the last victim was killed a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours makes sure Catherine will try to get the location out of Carls mind.<br /><br />It is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh who did music videos before this in a way goes back to these music videos. Every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me the visual style felt completely new the way Three Kings had a new visual style one year earlier. If something like that can make you like a film The Cell will not disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway. The story itself without the great fantasy world is good enough for that. I think you have to be a little open minded of course events are not (yet) possible in our real world. Still a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific.',pos
'Some unrealistic movie spoilers included.<br /><br />From real life experiences this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning. Im currently deployed on my second tour to Iraq as an infantry man. This film has nothing near what would happen in real life occurrences. From the very start to name a few: the bomb cart the EOD elements rolling out solo with no escorts the EOD staff sergeant sneaking of VBC having sleeves rolled the entire time in ACUs to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy the sniper scene. The list would continue however it is unnecessary to list things wrong happening with a time span of 2 minutes before more things were incorrect; and the point was made.<br /><br />This movie is for people and critics to watch that have no understanding or experience with deployments or the military.<br /><br />People with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy.',neg

'The Bat People is a really bad film that deserved the MST3K treatment just as well like that other film The Creeping Terror.<br /><br />In it we are in some sort of mountainous terrain full of bats. We see many things happen like bats flying out and attacking and stuff station wagon chases mishaps at the emergency room and much more! All this plus the cheesy mediocrity of the 1970s (hey think Mitchell here!) making The Bat People actually one of the very best of the last Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes made in the series! Moviewise its awful. It should be avoided like the plague unless Tom Servo and Crow are watching with you.<br /><br />The Bat People - more like The Bad People!!!!!

'This is not great cinema. The film is cliche ridden and in many places it is a copy of the original Carrie. The parallels with the original film are striking but with an added improbability about the telekenetic powers being congenital.<br /><br />I cant say that I disliked the film because it at least passed a couple of hours ... but these were passed as one would read an undemanding book on a long train journey. That book would not be great literature but would absorb one for a while and be forgotten soon afterwards in that it would blend in with the numerous other cliche ridden books. Likewise the film was okay whilst it lasted but is perhaps forgettable. At least I think it is. I cant remember much about it now!!',neg
'Being a seasoned fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento Mario Bava Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack. I had seen The Beyond which I think is totally overrated I found The New York Ripper to be simply appalling and I didnt particularly like The House By the Cemetery. These three movies left me to conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to check out more of his films. City of the Living Dead was a film I found very interesting but Dont Torture a Duckling is very nearly a masterpiece.<br /><br />Set in a small town in the Italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are being murdered. The authorities are clueless as to whos behind these crimes especially after their prime suspect has been cleared. An eager young reporter along with a rather slutty girl (who seduces young boys) investigate and eventually get to the bottom of it.<br /><br />Brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast (not always the case with 70s Italian thrillers) make Dont Torture a Duckling a crackling good thriller. The plot is well constructed not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals particularly in a scene where a woman gets beaten to death by some local townsfolk. Fulcis social commentary concerning religion and innocence are quite edgy and every aspect is well handled. When thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo New York Ripper its amazing how well he balances his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point. So far I havent seen any Fulci film made as professionally as this one.<br /><br />While not a traditional giallo film Duckling has many of the genres trademarks. Fulci displays complete control over the format only once going overboard with an unconvincing gore-moment but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics. The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a punch.<br /><br />So far Dont Torture a Duckling is Fulcis best film by far in my opinion. Edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to boot.',pos
'This is a joke right? This cant be a real film? Its not even a real video? Give any Harvey Milk High School kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this. The film makers cant be serious... right? Is this satire? Comedy? Drama gone horribly wrong? The script is about as single-minded and dull as is conceivable. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay. The dialogue isnt clichéd. Clichéd dialogue might elevate this holiday mess to something akin to camp fun - but it doesnt and it isnt. Worst of the worst - a landlady wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed a bathrobe carrying a frying pan like something out of a Honeymooners episode. Whaaa??? I have seen better acting from middle school drama clubs. One of the leads is an attractive lunk the other is not. Both cant even manage a convincing kiss. So much for romance. The supporting players are jaw-droppingly over-the-top.<br /><br />Everything is underscored by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a back room toilet. Most of the dialogue is (mercifully) unintelligible.<br /><br />This stale cinematic fruitcake isnt even worthy of being the next ROCKY HORROR or a gay holiday installment of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000. Its just plain bad. In every way. VISIONS OF SUGARPLUMS will not dance in your head - they will trample your every expectation. Have an eggnog and stare at mindlessly at the neighbors holiday lights - it will be time better spent.',neg
'I dont think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it!!<br /><br />If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie you must definitely see The Princess Bride.',pos

'First I rated this movie 10/10. To me its simply one of the best I saw since I was born (Im 23 but I saw numerous films). The story is cruel but reality is too not ? It went deep into me and stirred my bowels. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and I still remember it !<br /><br />Second there is no national preference (this expression is a direct translation from the French) for this movie. I mean its not because it is a French movie that I put it so high : it has really caught me when I saw it. Furthermore I dont know well Marcel Carnes filmography so I dont know if it is or not his best movie but I know it is not his most famous : Hotel du Nord Quai des Brumes and Les Enfants du Paradis are the most famous.<br /><br />Third the movies in B&W but it deals with inter-temporal problems of youth (not acne) like love friends and studies in a modern way. It could even be remade frame-by-frame with actual young actors a Dolby(tm) sound and special effects (a car crash) it would still be a great film !<br /><br />Problem : Maybe is it a film to be seen by young adults (from 16 to 25 years old) - and above of course - for its message to be well understood... Did I say it was a great movie ?',pos
'Is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television (or the media in general) as the 1960s? No. And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time? Not really. But if we must have one does it have to be as shallow as The 60s? <br /><br />I like to think that co-writers Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for this two-part miniseries than what ultimately resulted especially given Couturies involvement in the superb HBO movie Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam which utilized little original music and no original footage letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves. This presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production but it doesnt do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time; like so many of its ilk its seen from the point of view of one family. But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the 60s (its amazing that one of them doesnt go to the Rolling Stones gig at Altamont) making it seem less like a period drama and more like a Cliff Notes version of the decade.<br /><br />The makers rush through it so much that theres little or no time to give the characters any character with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the childrens father is especially clichéd - and then when theyre back on BLAMMO! its something else. Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly. In fairness Jerry OConnell Jordana Brewster Jeremy Sisto Julia Stiles and Charles S. Dutton give their material the old college try but theyre wasted (especially the latter two); its undeniably good to see David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton and Rosanna Arquette (in an uncredited cameo in part 2) is always welcome.<br /><br />What isnt welcome is how The 60s drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect (and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post-60s America never mentions the British Invasion - no Beatles no Rolling Stones... then again theres only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album right?). Capping its surface-skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out-of-place happy ending American Dreams and The Wonder Years did it all much much better. Nothing to see here you cant see elsewhere people... except for Julia Stiles doing the twist that is.',neg
'This is easily the most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon. Sure its flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike say how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or Titanic gave a realistic view of Italians YOU IDIOTS). Many of the jokes fall flat. But still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive. Its not The Fisher King but its not crap either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have cast someone else in the lead (I love Mel as a Director and Writer not so much as a lead).',pos
'OVERALL PERFORMANCE :- At last the long waiting AAG hits the screens. Unfortunately it couldnt set progressive fire in the audience. The first best thing to talk about the movie is The idea of remaking the mighty SHOLAY. And Varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie. If he repeated the same Ramghad backdrop people will again say there is nothing new in this. Different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy. Right from the start of his career with SIVA in Telugu he had been using the same lighting and kind of background. I seriously dunno this guy Varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis GODFATHER. Its all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why would some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme closeup shots!!!!!!! The shot division is lame. Characters couldnt carry an emotion performances are not to their mark Storytelling is worse Background is really really terrible.<br /><br />Babban:- Amitabhz been over prioritized to his job. VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre Bhavtakur Das Mallik Bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of Hindi Cinema. Theres no comparison of Gabbar with Babban. Babban is a more psycho rather than a villain still he has a soft corner for his brother ( Its a gift in this movie). Amitabhz performance is not to his mark. His appearance itself is pathetic. The scar on his nose symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema. What ever they worked on Babban is not successful. Babban is no comparison with Gabbar.<br /><br />Narsimha:- The first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands. If varma did that  it would be like teaching ABCD to a Bachelor degree holder. Itz good he opened the secret early. But the flashback is pathetic. Varma couldnt use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark.<br /><br />Durga:- The only character with betterment. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story.<br /><br />Heroo Raj Ghunguroo:- No body bothers or at least considers these character. The utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz. These characters carry nothing to this movie.<br /><br />RAMGOPALVARMA:- His quality is degrading diminishing. AAG totally can be treated as a C grade movie. Sholay is a fire of revenge problem of a town meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by Dharmendra. AAG never carried an emotion with its characters. Storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters. Dont compare AAG with sholay still u will not like it.<br /><br />If you dare watch this movie. You will be burnt alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG',neg

I was never interested in his movies before because I figured I wouldnt like anything in that style of cinema and because Ive heard most Cagney films are the same. I have to say I really liked it.

'ROMEO AND JULIET had been interpreted in so many ways but very few of the versions captured the essance of the play. The ony ones I can think of that really nail the romances spirit were WEST SIDE STORY and beleive it or not Troma Films TROMEO AND JULIET. At first glance this is another mere splatterfest and many would think it bastardizes the Shakespearian classic. However the film has an honest feel about it. Updated to appeal to the sick-minded youth of today of course but not without merit. Yes the frequent dismemberments body piercings car crashes lesbian sex scenes masturbation and incest are in bad taste but whats the harm when you have such a sweet love story as the foundation? As bad as most of the acting in this film is (I mean it IS Troma after all) the two leads have some genuine chemistry more so than in big-budget monstrosities TITANIC and STAR WARS EPISODE TWO. Theres a great deal of modernization but much of the original text is in tact especially when Tromeo and Juliet are together. Theres a great scene where Juliet utters the famous Parting is such sweet sorrow and tromeo quickly follows in mid-nineties grunge fashion Yeah it totally sucks. I think its truly unfortunate that this film isnt going to get the recognition or the wide release that it deserves. I hop that people who see this on the video store shelves wont be turned off by the grossmess in the movie because theyd be missing out on quite a subversive expereience.',pos
'Like Margot in Fear of Fear falls victim of her ambitious husband like Fox in Fox and his friends is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away like Xaverl Bolwieser in The Stationsmasters Wife who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him like Hermann Hermann who seeks refuge in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company so also Hans Epp is a victim of the German Wirtschaftswunder-Society after World War II in R.W. Fassbinders The Merchant of the Four Seasons. Simply from the fact that Fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women as well as between hetero- and homosexual couples it should be clear that he does not favorize any sex.<br /><br />In Hans Epps case there are the women who drive him into despair illness and finally death. When he comes back from the Foreign Legion where he flew because he could not stand anymore the pressure of his mother she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from her neighbor had been killed. Then Hans gets a job as a policeman but is surprised by his foreman while he is seduced by a prostitute. After having lost his job he works as a fruit-merchant with little income going from backyard to backyard crying out his produce. His mother one of his sisters and her husband are ashamed to have such a street-worker in their family. The love of his life (she has no name in the movie) refuses to marry him because his job does not fit together with her social status and origin. So he marries Irmgard whom he does not love and who does not love him. From her constant pressure on him he flees into drinking. One evening after his wife was stalking him he explodes and hits her. She flees to her family for which this event was just what they have been waiting for. When Irmgard is calling a lawyer for divorce Hans suffers a heart attack. Imrgard decides to stay with him but from now on he is not allowed anymore to do heavy work and to drink alcohol. So he starts to feel more and more superfluous gets quieter and quieter and more and more depressive. When he finds out that Irmgard cheats him he chooses to end his life but not like Hermann Hermann by having a trip into the light of madness but he drinks himself to death in front of Imrgard their little daughter and his boozing buddies. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. The question however is: Did Hans just kill himself because he could not stand anymore his miserable environment or did he make self-justice?',pos
'Buster absolutely shines in this episode which is the only vehicle Ive seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical (and silent!) comedy that made him famous. Its still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing I dont care for as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled. He even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reelers with Roscoe Arbuckle.<br /><br />My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for presenting us with this episode and for giving Busters genius full scope. He didnt have much time (one episode) to do it in but this is a touching tribute to Hollywoods greatest genius.',pos

'This film resembles in many ways `Enemy of the State with Will Smith and Gene Hackman as we have an innocent (black) man being pursued by the `government with all the modern technology known to man. Usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster. That does not apply here. Of course I love everything David Morse does so maybe my comments are not fair but there were more good things about this film then that. The main baddy played by Doug Hutchison was brilliant and the story flowed with excellent extras such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx) was however irritating most of the part. He is so out of place cracking bad jokes evoking no sympathy from the audience. Or not to begin with the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you (and on his followers as well!). I didnt expect much when I rented it but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits. 7/10',pos
'The film Classe tous risques directed by Claude Sautet was not a film to be honest I had ever really heard of until the Film Forum in NYC said that they would have a 2-week screening of the film with new English subtitles. When I also read that it was in the vein of the classic French crime films ala Jean Pierre Melville I jumped at the chance to check it out (at best it would rank up with his great works and at worst I would get some good popcorn in a great theater). It was well worth the admission as Classe tous risques is one of those kinds of French films that is just waiting to be re-discovered (or discovered for the first time). With terrific tense diligence Sautet keeps the suspense at a tight pitch for the first forty minutes of the film keeping a good (if not great) middle section and then ending it up with what is always expected with these films but with fascinating motivations by way of the characters. With a film in the vein of this sort you know how it will end but its the cool observant journey that counts.<br /><br />The film features a performance with some real truth and honesty amid the old-school criminals code by Lino Ventura as Aldo who at the start of the film (one of the best beginnings to a film in this genre and country) steals a hefty amount of money with his partner in crime). When there is a sudden ugly twist of fate on a beach late one night Aldo is again on the run with two little kids. He gets the aid of Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo a role in tune with Le Doulos only with a smidgen more humanity and charisma) who is also a thief and drives him into Paris. But there are some problems with some of Aldos old business partners and one old score may be just the right ticket. A couple of times the plot may seem to be leisurely but it isnt. Like Melville Sautet doesnt allow any fat to his story and its a very tightly structured film with some good doses of humor here and there (I was sometimes grinning at the audacity of the criminals in the beginning chase sequence and also with a particular woman who had a finicky thing with her cat and a fish).<br /><br />Along with a fine score by the great George Delerue exceptional cinematography and a mood that is seldom met let alone matched now adays Classe tous risques is a reminder of that bridge between the real old-school film-noir and the latter day crime films. Gangsters in these new sort of thug-life movies have a 1000th of the class and honor of the thieves in this film and is a second banana to the works of Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment I assure you). That it has a good realistic moral edge helps as well.',pos
'Other reviews have talked about how frank this film is especially in terms of male frontal nudity. Well those whove seen Grande Ecole with its frequently naked actors and expect something similar are in for a big disappointment. Other than a few seconds in the judo team locker room the two leads side by side shower lasts a grand total of 15 seconds. The female lead has comparably brief frontal moments. A lot of this films marketing is geared to the gay male audience but those expecting even a hint of homoeroticism between the two male leads (best friends who have a three-way with the girlfriend of one of them) will be most disappointed. There is not even the hint of either ones being interested in the other or even scarcely aware that the other is part of the menage a trois. As a film Douches Froides is curiously uninvolving; the viewer gets very little sense of who these three young people are of how they are feeling of why they behave as they do. About one hour of the original cut was deleted; perhaps this is why the finished film seems frustratingly undeveloped. Stick with Grande Ecole a French film which more than delivers on its promises.',neg
'The actors did a really good job playing their roles--particularly the mom. However as the movie progressed I found I was watching it more for their acting and not because I cared in the least for the people. And at times I felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands-off approach to parenting displayed again and again. The daughter is a 17 year-old shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette (complete with lots of booty shaking). The son is a guy with low self-esteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends--so much that he throws a drug party late in the film. The husband and wife are both bored but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners (though the wife picks poorly as the man she throws herself at happens to be gay---OOPS!). I just felt that ALL the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks. I think the authors attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system. However given that these characters are NOT typical of the average western family it seems disingenuous.',neg
'I loved this show. I used to actually leave the pub ten minutes before closing and run down the road to catch it. I remember Daniel Peacocks sketch about Gandhi in the newsagents as a masterpiece. The set design and lighting were out of this world creating an atmosphere that you felt you were actually living in. V unusual for a comedy.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have only encountered one other person (apart from the other reviewer here) who ever knew that this programme existed. In fact I have to thank the IMDb for coming into existence and proving to me that I hadnt in fact imagined the whole series in a drunken haze which I was seriously starting to believe!',pos
'Just saw the movie and the scary thing was the people talking during the movie sounded just like the actors. The movie had its moments but also lagged and was rather sick. It was all meant to be a farce but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie you think to yourself People like this are all around us All attempts at getting the audiences sympathy are dashed as the actors do one stupid thing after another. On the plus side there are some great (and funny) insults. I think I would wait for video- but it was a good laugh. WARNING- Jerry takes his shirt off during the movie!! (not a pretty sight!)',pos
'This is an excellent movie. There were several parts to the movie I liked. This movie is very funny! Visit the Ernest fun club web site at www.ernestfunclub.com There are several movies such as the following: Ernest Goes to Camp Ernest Saves Christmas Ernest Goes to Jail Ernest in the Army Ernest Goes to School Ernest Rides Again Slam Dunk Ernest etc. I highly recommend these for family movies. All star Jim Varney again try visiting www.ernestfunclub.com Which is the best Ernest movie? In my opinion there are actually 2 Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest Goes to Jail. So if you have never seen Ernest P. Worrell its time to go and see him. You will find him quite satisfactory no what I mean?',pos
'I was pretty young when this came out in the US but I recorded it from TV and watched it over and over again until I had the whole thing memorized. To this day I still catch myself quoting it. The show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters from Frank Sinatra to Sylvester Stallone to Mr. T. The voices were great and sounded just like the characters they were portraying. The puppets were also well done although a little creepy. I was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf a show that I also enjoy very much. Like another person had written in a comment earlier I too was robbed of this great show by a friend who borrowed it and never returned it. I sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a DVD release but I dont think enough people have heard of it. Oh well maybe Ill try e-bay...',pos
'Man this movies sucked. It appeared to have like seven different plots going on at once and they all made little to no sense. The special effects costumes and all that stuff were beyond awful. The acting was particullary bad. Everything seemed so forced especially the lines from the woman with the huge eyes and the little kid (his Noooooo as he gets burried is so unenthusiastic its laughable). A good portion of this movie is rather funny anyway. The one womans death where she shoves a knife into a toaster gets electrocuted and magically turns into the crapiest skeleton dummy in the world had my friends and I laughing for a good ten minutes.<br /><br />Bottom line: If youre into watching really horrible movies seek this one out. If not run for your life.',neg

'This movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in Russia. Epic movie about Russian culture Great saga of Russian spirit endless articles and interviews. For me this movie was the biggest disappointment. The main character played by Oleg Menshikov is a stupid immature boy ready to set up his comrades because of a woman who doesnt even look like a lady. What is there to admire? In the first part of the movie the story doesnt develop at all. Peoples festival scenes look like boasting about Russian audacity.<br /><br />I respect Mr. Mikhalkov for his previous works both as actor and director but this movie just demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the Tzar of Russian cinema.',neg
'Ill tell you what happened some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on TV. Did we really need a big screen re-make? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of Rocky Horror Picture Show with actors like Ashton Krutcher Steve Martin Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland took out all the music and made it a drama. Do you think they would like that! This movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had. Sure the original was a bit corny at times but Bo and Luke were always nice they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. None of that mattered to the people that made this film they might have never even seen the original show all the way through. My big question is what will they ruin next?',neg

'One True Thing is a very quiet film that opened in the fall of 1998 to glowing reviews but mild box-office. It tells the crippled story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger) a workaholic who is forced to move back home to take care of her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep) so that her aloof father (William Hurt) can run his academic department. These terms are only general. The strength of One True Thing lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above Hollywood cliché territory.<br /><br />Streep is Kate the perfect homemaker whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party celebrating Hurts birthday. But Ellen has never been close to her mother and since she graduated from Harvard University has a certain destain about her- Ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic air-head. While on the other hand she admires her father- who shares a special passion: Writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York firm and is almost heartbroken when her latest piece is torn down by Hurt who seems to be a very lonely figure.<br /><br />To get to the point as Kate gets sicker Ellens perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father. Hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most and Ellen assumes hes having an affair. Meanwhile shes given up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mothers cult group The Minnies and also learning that her mother isnt as weak as she first assumed.<br /><br />Without giving too much away One True Thing is a masterpiece in character study. Streep once again turns in a beautiful performance this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the vows of marriage. Streep earned her eleventh Oscar nomination for this performance. Hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that isnt revealed until the closing moments. But it is Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. Forget Chicago Cold Mountain Bridget Joness Diary or whatever else youve seen her do and rent this movie. She is remarkable in it. Working within her characters bitter resentment at understanding her parents Zellweger manages a realistic portrayal of a young woman fighting to keep her lip up while shes screaming inside.',pos
'Very bad acting and a very shallow story. Not even a decent B-Movie<br /><br />Events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame.<br /><br />This is one of the worst sci-fi Ive ever seen.

'Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind they starred together in this movie. George Clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer along with Steven Soderbergh which shows that they really believed in this project. In potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project that is in the same line with movie-remakes such as Oceans Eleven and The Italian Job but somehow this movie is only halve successful or at least it isnt as good as it could had been.<br /><br />The movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop. Even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie. The fact that they are being played doesnt change much to this even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying or anything like that at all.<br /><br />Its of course due to the writing that the characters arent used to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian movie I Soliti ignoti works out much better than this movie does. The movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling.<br /><br />Nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity. Its an harmless little caper movie in which you simply shouldnt to worry much about the story. In that regard Welcome to Collinwood is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose well.<br /><br />Its a movie that you wont regret watching once youve finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing.<br /><br />7/10',pos
'The Daily Mails Christopher Tookey had some choice things to say about this film among them watch it all the way through its 82 miserable minutes and I guarantee youll be shaking your head and asking: Have we really descended to this? Yes we have for if ever a movie testified to the utter cynicism tastelessness and moral corruption of those who commission and make British movies it is this abomination. Tookey continues aimed squarely at oafs with unwashed underwear filthy minds and knuckles that graze the pavement when they walk this sex comedy is so sordid unfunny and malodorous that it is enough to put you off sex and indeed films for life before concluding Sex Lives of the Potato Men is not merely a truly vile film it is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant self-gratification yobbishness and sadism that is now being celebrated on screen. Normally I dont listen too closely to the critics but in this case Tookey was bang on the money. This film goes beyond bad indeed it goes beyond being merely unfunny and enters some bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for an hour and where the definition of hilarious seems to be saying tw*t in a Brummie accent. Its depressing to anyone with half a brain who grew up with the Goodies Monty Python Spitting Image Not the Nine OClock News and Fawlty Towers.<br /><br />Ideally Sex Lives Of the Potato Men would have quietly vanished after its cinema release and joined the equally dire Vix spin-off The Fat Slags (2004) and the ill-starred All Saints vehicle Honest (2000) in the celluloid graveyard but as it seems destined for endless late night schedule-filling screenings and misguided best film EVER! raves from people who should know better so I must apologise in advance for trying to right a wrong that the British film industry in all its wisdom has inflicted onto an undeserving world. Yes I really am sorry to bring this one back from the celluloid dead but I actually remember thinking It cant be as bad as the critics said it was...but as God is my witness it was WORSE.<br /><br />Acting - dire from start to finish special mention to Mackenzie Albert Steptoes legs on a young mans body Crook.<br /><br />Soundtrack - cut and paste ladrock mostly ska-based lager-lout-friendly pub jukebox piffle which brought back horrible memories of seeing those chirpy cockernee doin the Lambeth Walk to a watered-down imitation of the Specials knob-shiners Madness on every single comedy / variety programme in the eighties...and Ace Of Spades by Motorhead as the title music? What the hell...trying to evoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes ever offered by The Young Ones indeed ever offered by ANY comedy show?! Cheap shot way below the belt.<br /><br />Script - written by a 12 year old whos just read every single back issue of Smut and Zit in one long Red Bull-fuelled session...SURELY? Cmon no real proper worldly grown-up person could possibly set this kind of retarded hogwash on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in it...Mark Gatiss...the least annoying member of the League of Gentlemen and Goodies fan taking part in such a towering heap of fly-blown cinematic excrement? One of the brightest British comedy stars? Not any more hes not! On the subject of League Of Gentlemen somebody give me a pair of lead-lined divers boots and Steve face like a collapsed rectum Pemberton and a long weekend in a soundproofed room before I die...PLEASE...<br /><br />Cinema British or otherwise just doesnt come much worse than this.

'Crossfire is a justifiably famous 1947 noir thats a murder mystery with a strong message. It stars Robert Young Robert Mitchum Robert Ryan Sam Levene and Gloria Grahame and is strongly directed by Edward Dmytryk. We witness the murder in shadow at the beginning and for the rest of the film Young as the detective Finlay in charge of the case seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death and just as important why. The victim Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and Samuels winds up dead.<br /><br />I dont know about 1947 but seeing Crossfire today one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects. I dont suppose it was so apparent back then as these actors were just getting started. Nevertheless the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting good direction violence and unsparing anti-Semite language.<br /><br />The characterizations are vivid including that of Gloria Grahame in a smallish role - shes a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper) one of the suspect soldiers in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. The big performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan but everyone is excellent. Robert Young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife.<br /><br />Truly excellent and a must see.',pos
'Two Soldiers is an excellent example of fine film-making. The director and producer took a heart-warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast excellent cinematography and very creative artistry.<br /><br />The relaxed back-woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into. The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back-woods of North Carolina and an even harder life of war.<br /><br />The acting was great particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr) to the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the powerful performance by the Colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was extremely well cast.<br /><br />It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers and I heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages.',pos
'The House of the Dead was the worst movie I have ever seen between the pathetic matrix 360 camera angle attemps and the cheesy acting I fell asleep. I dont think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. I would rate this movie a 1 out of 10 (10 being the best 1 being the worst). Also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time. I beg anyone who reads this NOT TO SEE IT. Its not worth the time.',neg
'Lazy writing bad acting and wooden direction lead us to a 2005 Canadian-made TV movie called HUSH not to be confused with about eight other movies using the same name. Tori Spelling and her doctor hubby move from SanFran to his small hometown where they run into his old gal pal who decides she still loves him. She gets pregnant with Toris baby (dont ask) and starts knocking off anyone who might get in her way as she plans to reunite with her old flame. The actors playing the old gal pal and the doctor are not worth mentioning as they act flatter than flat. Tori isnt much better but at least she is something to focus on as the plot meanders here and there before arriving at a very lame and all-too-familiar conclusion. Watch instead THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE.',neg
'I had to watch this movie with my 5-year-old. He didnt laugh once during the entire movie...and he loves dogs and will laugh at nearly anything! This movie was horrible from all aspects: poor script (even accounting for a childrens G-rated movie) poor production (the jittery camera shots made me feel nauseous for the first ten minutes) poor acting (perhaps they were directed to act cartoonish) and even poor sound quality (there are parts where the audio level seems fine then you cant hear what the next actor is saying). Im willing to put up with quite a lot when it comes to watching a childs movie but this was worse than having a stick in my eye. I also didnt like being battered over the head with the god-heaven-belief thing. In all it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life...and Ive done some serious time-wasting in my day!',neg
'I am awed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her superb skill as an action star! This movie is propelled by her wonderful acting and terrific action prowess. I am a fan of sci-fi but I must say that this film exceeds most science fiction films in its cinematography and mostly its utilization of an actress whose presence supersedes the plot which is fine but is nothing new. Even though it looks as though this film was made for television in my opinion it is better than most theatrically released films of its kind.',pos
'Thats the sound of Stan and Ollie spinning in their graves.<br /><br />I wont bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as theyre so obvious they go without saying. Small things like this being The All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made. Little things like that. <br /><br />A bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons whom just happen to be called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as that is it might have worked. For a really bad idea try casting two actors to impersonate the duo. Okay they might claim to be nephews but the end result is the same.<br /><br />Bronson Pinchot can be funny. Okay forget his wacky foreigner Cousin Larry schtick in Perfect Strangers and look at him in True Romance. Here though he stinks. Its probably not all his fault and like the director and the support cast - all of who are better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money. There are those who claim Americans find it difficult to master an effective English accent. This cause is not helped here by Pinchot. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in Stans trademark yelp does he come close though as the yelp is overdone to the point of tedium thats nothing to write home about. Gailard Sartain does slightly better as Ollie though its like saying whats worse - stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the knackers? <br /><br />Remember the originals with their split-second timing intuitive teamwork and innate loveability? Well thats absent altogether replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so mistimed you could park a bus through the gaps. Whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels this one has some long-winded Mummy hokum (and what a lousy title!) thats mixed in with the boys fraternity scenario. I cant claim to have seen every single one of Laurel and Hardys 108 movies but I think its a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of this.<br /><br />Maybe the major problem is that the originals were sort-of playing themselves or at least using their own accents. It at least felt natural and unforced as opposed to the contrived caricatures Pinchot and Sartain are given. And since when did Stan do malapropisms and so many at that? I was gonna give you a standing cremation; I would like to marinate my friend. Stop it! <br /><br />Only notable moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmons L & H comic. Harmon of course bought the name copyright (how disconcerting to see a ® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this travesty. <br /><br />Questions abound. Would Stan and Ollie do fart gags if they were alive today? Would they glass mummies with broken bottles? Have Stan being smacked in the genitals with a spear and end on a big CGI-finale? Lets hope not.<br /><br />I did laugh once but I think that was just in disbelief at how terrible it all is. Why was this film made in the first place? Who did the makers think would like it? Possibly the worst movie Ive ever seen an absolute abhorrence I grew sick of watching after just the first five minutes. About as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red-hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted up your back passage.',neg
'I enjoy watching people doing breakdance especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called Roxy. Especially at Christmas time because there also appears a MC Santa Claus.<br /><br />Even if this is an old film and even if I have videotaped it from TV when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen I went there to check it out. Its much more enjoyable on big screen than on TV.<br /><br />Even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket I got the moneys worth by seeing this as it is on big screen especially seated on front row of the cinema an unforgettable experience and much better than just on video.',pos
'I felt this movie started out well. The acting was spot on and I felt for all the characters situation even though the true family unit was not completely revealed. We never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with Tobe. I mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off. Another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus by the end and I was begging for it to just be over with. Any movie with such a long drawn out  and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or above just for the acting. We are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience. In the case of this movie the end is so bad I seriously contemplated just walking out of the theater. This movie pulled me in then just spit me out.',neg
'S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Crappy i Killed myself. There was absolutely no acting to speak of.

The production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits. The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store.

'Born in 1946 I was about eight years old when first viewing this movie and it left a deep impression.Not only scary for lack of a better word this movie haunted me for more than 50 years.The mob goon played by John Larch was terrifying.The only scene that stuck out in my mind during those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the uncaring policeman referring to her as a little n----- kid.Those words were replaced when the movie was shown recently on TVmaybe there are two versions of the movie or someone felt compelled to alter a little bit this heart breaking scene.Accurate or not the film went a long way in formulating my opinion of the South and still till today the closest Ive come to visiting a southern city is El Paso.That stand may seem extreme but there is a little bit more to the story.When the movie was shown recently it became clearer why it haunted me for years.With the newsreel like beginning this movie gives the impression that what is being shown is fact.The film is made supposedly only one or two years after the depicted incidents adding to its realistic credibility.The terror in the movie isnt provided by creatures or space aliens but by persons living in our society at the time.Re killing of little girl:The recent viewing helped make clearer the impact it had on my 8 year old mind.When this movie came out the only school I had ever gone to was attended by mostly African-Americans.The victim looked like a girl in my classit was like seeing an actual killing.It made a horrible scene that much worse.Maybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me.',pos
'Such pain! Pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea but it never fully recognised it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face. I wouldnt say this straight-to-video South African/Canadian/UK horror flick is awful but its just too bland predictable and theres just very little memorable about it. Its a guarantee youll forget it not too long after watching it. I tried watching it last night but had to finish it during the morning as I couldnt keep my eyes open. Even then I couldnt remember where I got up to which left me watching it from the beginning again. The only thing that hit a chord was Andreas Poulssons sharp cinematography of the vast harsh and eerie desert locations. A nice glossy chic creates a striking visual sense which cant save the film from that overall empty feeling. Everything else is below-par and almost comes off grating. Like the head-scratching revelation of the beast. Huh. The computer-generated special effects of the ominous monster are tolerable and there are some grisly flashes of stripped flesh and bones. But theres too little as theres no hiding the fact that the clichéd script wants to ponder on the generic character conflict to build tension and uncertainty. That would be fine if the wilted script was more than just basic shallow fluff because it never generated any strong lasting suspense but makes it uninterestingly labour on. The lead characters are superficial and the token support fall in the dispensable basket. Its your stereotypical bunch. Scott Bairstow and Warrick Griers performances are colourless and the beautiful Rachel Shelley tries but looks rather weary.',neg
'1936 was the most prolific year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second film for RKO that year is the third film in this collection  Mark Sandrichs Follow The Fleet. This time out Astaire is painfully uncomfortable as Bake Baker a seaman on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront café where Sherry Martin (Rogers) is warbling romantic sweet nothings in everyones ear. Yep you guessed it  theyre hot for each other once again. Only this time Sherrys spinster sister Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens the whole fine romance by falling for Bakes robust seafaring buddy Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a sort of use em up and toss em out kind of guy thus forcing Sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general. Irving Berlin lends immeasurable class to the proceedings with his classic classy score including standards Let Yourself Go Im Putting All My Eggs in One Basket and Lets Face the Music and Dance; the latter a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime pas deux for Fred and Ginger. <br /><br />The transfer on Follow The Fleet is a tad weaker. The gray scale remains nicely balanced but now its a tad thick looking with not nearly as much tonal variation as the previous titles. Grain is still present. So are age related artifacts. Once youve settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage. The audio is Mono but very nicely balanced. Extras include a featurette theatrical trailer and short subject but oddly  no audio commentary. Considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of Astaire/Rogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from Warner Home Video.',pos
'089: Footlight Parade (1933) - released 9/30/1933 viewed 5/5/07.<br /><br />The ice cream cone is invented in New York.<br /><br />KEVIN: After a long and busy break we hit another Busby Berkeley musical from Warner Bros. This time its the ultra-fast paced Footlight Parade starring James Cagney as juggernaut stage producer Chester Kent. I am 100\% certain that Cagney was channeling Berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible Kent who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute. Joan Blondell is also excellent as the acid-tongued secretary-turned-love interest. The Ruby Keeler/Dick Powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable. One thing that baffled me was Berkeleys performances themselves which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards. Obviously Busby doesnt let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most over-the-top musical numbers he can possibly conjure. I liked nearly all of this movie until the end with the shamelessly offensive number Shanghai Lil which as one can guess is about as stomach-turning as racially distasteful performances come.<br /><br />DOUG: Six movies in three months. Got to be a new record. Anywaythis completes Warner Bros. musical trilogy of 1933 preceded by 42nd Street and Gold Diggers of 1933. I would definitely recommend watching all three in a row. I wonder if James Cagney was channeling Busby Berkeley while he was playing Chester Kent in this movie or if that the role as written was inspired by Busby. I hope it was; it seems to make sense that Berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way Chester does. The funny thing about Cagney was that he didnt really look like a leading man in the traditional sense. He was 57 square-headed and talked with an odd New York accent. But the guy was quite versatile going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fast-talking producer-types we see here. And he could dance. Basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor. The rest of the cast has some familiar faces; Joan Blondell returns and just about steals the show as Cagneys loyal and lusting secretary; Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler play the cute couple but seem to get less screen time than before; Billy Barty pops up again as the mischievous imp. The movie is typical of the more racy and adult-oriented musicals of the pre-Code era as opposed to those of the 50s and 60s that were more family oriented and is an excellent climax of the Warner musicals of that year (the Shanghai Lil number not withstanding with Keeler doing a poor job at looking Chinese).<br /><br />Last film: Dinner At Eight (1933). Next film: Im No Angel (1933).',pos
'This is one of those movies that showcases a great actors talent and also conveys a great story. It is one of Stewarts greatest movies. Barring a few historic errors it also does an excellent job of telling the story of the Spirit of St. Louis.',pos
'I finally got hold of Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and rousing Henry Mancini score to the max. After having viewed Lifeforce for fifteen years on tape I have to say that the uncut DVD version was both great and disappointing. The U.S. version is so *much* better than the DVD (European?) version. The U.S. version of lifeforce moves much faster (the editing on the DVD version is terrible. Feels like an unfinished cut). And the many scenes not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact one new moment almost destroys the entire movie when Caine (peter firth) meets the male alien at the cathedral. I love this scene in the U.S. version though. On the DVD the male alien speaks to Caine and what he says is soooooo hilarious. Its the pinnacle of hilarity:<br /><br />Itll be much less terrifying if you just come to me! the male alien says in a deep 1950s style voice. I was floored when I saw this. It just doesnt belong in the movie. That scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick. Im glad Hooper (or whoever) cut that scene when the movie was released in North America. There are several changes that were made for the U.S. version that make Lifeforce that much better and I wished the DVD had the U.S. version. The editing is sharp and frenzied without being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the U.S. version are even more boring on the DVD version because of added scenes. And the opening credits on the DVD is terrible. Much better in the U.S. version. More subtle.<br /><br />I love this film. Its basically aliens making a pit-stop over earth and sucking up as much Lifeforce as possible. The film has too many flat uninspiring sequences (talk talk talk) but when the action goes to London its fun. The film really shines in these scenes. One can see Hooper finally doing what hes great at: chaos savagery horror! Lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. Theyre the best Apocalyptic scenes ever put on film. Its also the best zombie movie ever. The zombies are hungry (for lifeforce not flesh) and theyre crazed and agile and terrifying. Not the slow moving bores of other zombie movies. Also a lot of people have criticized the ending but I love it. It leaves you high and dry like one of the lifeforce-drained victims.<br /><br />And to think this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s when people flocked to E.T. or Cocoon or other sweet and boring feel good sci-fi movies. No wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic point of view!<br /><br />As for the DVD well it aint great. The image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever. But its great to see the movie in its widescreen format. I just hope that theyll release a clean crisp U.S. version on a DVD and with commentary by Hooper and Dykstra.',pos
'This is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used. Almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated X and so seen as a pornographic movie. Here is a kind of romantic horror story combined with the females own satisfaction need.<br /><br />A very good film!',pos
'Agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show. I remember the series well as I was in the Florida Keys when the show had its debut. I was looking through old VCR tapes that were keepers and came across two that had about eight episodes. I ended up spending part of Christmas night (and the next) watching these shows. The singer was Bankie Banx - saw his name come up on the credits. Hes from Anguilla and owns a beach front bar called The Dune Preserve. Hes a longtime friend of Jimmy Buffett and Bankies classic song Still In Paradise is featured on the latest Buffett CD/DVD combo called Live In Anguilla - it is track #12 on CD 1 and #8 on the CD. I too would like to someday see this short lived series come out on DVD. Keep the faith!',pos
'Typical story of an evil kid going after people. I suspect that Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear on Starsky and Hutch) and Vincent Schiavelli didnt want to stress this junk on their resumes (actually Schiavelli left this life with a mostly good resume). Sometimes I wish that the killers in these movies would just go after the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these movies every other month (note: that comment is not to be taken seriously; I just think that slashers have lost their touch).<br /><br />Anyway this is one movie that youll do best to avoid. Its ninety minutes to two hours that Ill never get back.',neg
'Well no not really. Its not really a good movie but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I really didnt feel ripped off of my rental money and sometimes thats all you can ask for. The plot is OK nothing brilliant or new the acting is pretty bad but the cast is pretty. The directing is passable but the effects are horrible especially the werewolf effects which in a werewolf movie is a pretty big problem. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity which to me is a pretty good thing but it wasnt all that hot. All in all its a fairly average direct to video movie not the worst film Ive ever seen and if youre bored a genre fan check it out sometime. Id even watch it again.<br /><br />Bonus fact for horror geeks Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf.',neg
'If somebody wants to make a really REALLY bad movie Wizards of the Lost Kingdom really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness.<br /><br />Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... Some poor schmuck in a baggy white furry costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting. Work your way slowly painfully through more not-so-special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief. Add a garden gnome (just for the heck of it).<br /><br />On second thought skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half.',neg
'Am I the only one to think that this is a bad movie?<br /><br />I admit that horror movies often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects. But the way these deficiencies come together in this movie is surprisingly pitiful.<br /><br />Miserable story: The idea of a raped vagina that takes revenge by turning into a man eater sounds quite funny but what the writer made out of it is stupid.<br /><br />Bad acting: The actors move like marionettes. They play and look like people who really try hard but completely fail to act.<br /><br />Bad FX: Especially the explosion of the Van looks unspeakably cheap.<br /><br />It is surprising that a director who made some nice movies during his carrier changes over to such messy stuff.',neg
'Set in Providence Rhode Island Feeding the Masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government. At best it could be applied to how the US try to control media during the Iraq War but it ends up feeling hollow. Theres never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good. Worst the direction of the movie is atrocious focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond Isnt this an odd way to hold the camera. Special effects are pretty bad...at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city and its laughable at best.<br /><br />The film does have a couple bright spots...namely the advertisements for post-zombie services (including a reclamation service and a party bus). But its far too little to make the film worthwhile.<br /><br />For a better zombie film try Hide and Creep. It has the same weak production value but theres much more wit humor and talent behind it.',neg
'Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock n roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley Chuck Berry Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.<br /><br />This easy to watch bio is not without flaws. Some situations events places and even names were not correct for various reasons. What makes this movie so believable is that Gary Busey did his own singing in the part of Holly. A well produced soundtrack became a multi-million seller.<br /><br />Busey was nominated for an Oscar. Other stars of note are Don Stroud Conrad Janis Charles Martin Smith and Maria Richwine.',pos
'I did here this movie was good from various people. Plus I do like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem as well as the director Milos Forman. Yet after watching this movie I really had nothing to admire about it.<br /><br />First off the acting was very much below average. The performances were just not powerful enough to really feel shocked by what the inquisition did. Javier Bardem did give a solid performance and was probably the only one who actually had as Spanish accent. It is pretty obvious why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman who I think is a very good up and coming actress did not really make me feel sorry for her being tortured. Like the movie there was nothing to admire about her performance. Stellan Skarsgaard who I do like gave a very average performance like the other actors giving a boring performance. This movie was essentially about him since he plays Goya. Yet he did not become what he needed to be to make this movie good. What about Randy Quaid? You have just got to be kidding me. Him playing King Carlos IV. Look he is great in comedies but him playing a King that just describes the whole movie for you.<br /><br />The directing was just horrible in this movie. When a movie is a mess there are usually two people to blame for that: the director and the writer. I get the feeling that Milos Forman really didnt want his actors to put a Spanish accent on. From the very few battle scenes in here they were all displayed horribly. Also as a director he needs to give you the feeling of shock of what the inquisition did. After this movie I felt like I could careless about the event. To sum it all up he poorly shot the scenes and misguided the actors.<br /><br />The writing which was also done by Milos Forman was just as bad or maybe even worse than the directing. There really was nothing memorable of the movie except for one seen where Bardem does get the same treatment that Portmans character has gotten. Other then that the movie did not give you the feeling of the time period and at least it could have made up for it with a quote or two.<br /><br />After finishing this movie I was just looking at the T.V. thinking OK why should I care about any of this. I do care and are very much interested in history but when movies like this come up it feels like the producers robbed you of something good that could have been taken away from the movie. When movies are this bad we highlight a lot of the technical faults in a movie than if it was good. Like the accents. Im not sure people would have emphasized the lack of Spanish accents if this movie was good.<br /><br />Thw whole point of this review is to say just dont watch it.',neg
'Why did I enjoy the show to the last episode? Because of the true talent Melissa Joan Hart and her supporting cast had of demonstrating that whit comedy light-hearted humor and deep thought could actually coexist. What I enjoyed most was the fact that I could come home from a hard days work and bust a smile... I was inspired... and why? It was an inspiration to watch as this magical person was so happy while helping others. <br /><br />Sabrina was a hero in my opinion... even though she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from our own... to very different; she had powers at her fingertip wishes and command that could be used for good or bad which may only exist in many of our imaginations. Most everything we see have know about own or even desire... can be used for good or bad and how we choose to define that defines the person we are. <br /><br />She traveled the globe and other realms with these constant and unwaivering ideas in mind... to learn to live to laugh and to love. She was always learning how to improve her skills to the benefit of all around her; she made mistakes as she was living life going through different journeys of growth as she her aunts and Salem (the underrated yet imperfect hero) did well to demonstrate that even through mistakes you can still be noble gifted and wonderful. <br /><br />She also demonstrated many selfless learning and loving acts as she went along her way. If this isnt reason enough for 10 stars in this war torn world where people are so hostile toward each other not realizing how differences are the spice of life rather than a reason to kill... then I dont know what is. This show was most certainly a trip to a better world as well as an inspiration to be better ourselves and a gift intended to bust a smile on our chops... Ive heard from a doctor before that everything that Ive mentioned above leads to a healthy hart... and isnt that what we all need? :)',pos
'This Harold Lloyd short wasnt really much; not one of his funnier efforts. Of course I never see bratty kids as anything hilarious. Thats what the bulk of this story is Harold and his wife Mildred Davis babysitting his in-laws two young kids. One is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolish the house. Letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me.<br /><br />The best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (Noah Young) is burglarizing their house. Half the time its the pet cat scaring the couple but overall that segment is fun with some good sight gags reminding me of another Lloyd short Haunted Spooks.<br /><br />However the good ending doesnt save the whole picture which I probably wouldnt watch again. Lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again. It just isnt that funny.',neg
'Finally an indie film that actually delivers some great scares! I see most horror films that come out... Theatrical Straight-To-DVD cable etc... and most of them suck... a few are watchable... even fewer are actually good... Dark Remains is one of the good ones. I caught a screening of this film at the South Padre Island Film Festival... the audience loved it... and my wife and I loved it! Having no name actors I assume the budget on this film was pretty low but you wouldnt know it... the film looks fantastic... the acting totally works for the film... the story is good... and the scares are great! While most filmmakers focus solely on the scares they often forget about story and character development two things that help to deliver the scares more efficiently. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that character and story are important. He develops both to the point where you care about the characters you know the characters and are therefore more scared when they are in danger.<br /><br />Watching horror films that cost anywhere from $80 million to $5000 to make I find Dark Remains to be one of the gems out there. Check this film out!',pos
'till HBO began rerunning it this month. I remember laughing out loud in the theater back in 1991 and now again in my living room. If I see that its on I have to watch it. Theres just no question. This is so much more entertaining to me than other more popular spoofs like Airplane! (which I really like BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes like Sudden speech! The last symptoms of brain fever! She could blow at any moment! put me over the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg hasnt been this funny since Jumpin Jack Flash. Kevin Klein Sally Field Robert Downey Jr. all turn in superb performances as expected. I started out giving this 9 out of 10 stars but then I realized that for the type of film its supposed to be there isnt one thing Id change or improve upon. So 10 it is. I have to get this on DVD thats just all there is to it.',pos
'Much said without words.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. It was made in color-not color as in todays films but a special mono-color use (with shadings) that portrayed meaning mood sense and time. It should be seen in color as it becomes an entirely different film. The story by Nobel prize-winner Selma Lagerlöf is effectively presented. One never has a clear sense of real memory or phantom. Changes going on in Swedish society at the time are subtly layered. Most highly recommend. Try to rent it or find it on-line. I saw it in a Swedish film class and I want to add it to my film library.',pos
'Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor of all time he is without a doubt on others lists as well when it comes to great actors. He even pulled off a good Irish accent in Ordinary Decent Criminal as well. But Kevin Spacey as a Mafia leader? Or even a burglar? Im not so sure he could go that far. The movie to me just didnt make any sense and the some of the story just didnt feel solved to me.<br /><br />I know once again that IMDb is going to make me write ten more lines. But Im not so sure on what I could say about this movie because I am still trying to figure it out. Silly isnt it? But Im pretty sure that more than a few of you IMDb users have been in the same predicament as I am in right now where you just want to say a line or two about a movie but now you have to do ten lines?

At least the ending is worth the wait for those who will still care by that time.',neg
'I enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love-hate relations along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline. All the main characters are well cast. True John Wayne or Robert Mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well but Victor Mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling Tarzan of sorts. Reminds me of his film role as Samson another difficult but not impossible man to tame.<br /><br />The mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts. This story supposedly takes place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War. Judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene(probably Mt. Lassen) the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the Cascades as we never see any other civilians. However there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort is the namesake of a very famous Sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie(eastern Wyoming)is mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort. The plains tribe of Assiniboines is mentioning as joining Red Cloud. This aspect of the story then bears a general resemblance to historical fact.<br /><br />It may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of John Fords Fort Apache. In both cases we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with Native American problems. He underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career. In both films he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy.. Also in common the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local Native Americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do. In both films we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commanders heart and a subordinate which the commander does everything to squelch. Clearly the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion.<br /><br />I also see certain resemblances with The Misfits. The soldiers as a whole including the commander are misfits of a sort((as one of them admits): mostly they have problems or are raw recruits with no experience fighting Native Americans. The commanders wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort thus is inherently a misfit with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army. The trappers in turn are also misfits not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent army-generated antagonism by Red Cloud. <br /><br />Finally we can also compare this story with Anthony Manns later film The Far Country starring Jimmy Stewart. In Stewarts case he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy at the end. But Matures character doesnt come up with an appetizing new way of being his own boss. Red Cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate. Besides he has an obsession with the Commanders wife.',pos

'What happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm? Homeless people answer to no one. They have no mortgages rent payments or idiot bosses. Homeless people dont have to worry about the IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments. But give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly they have to worry about entering the rat race buying gas for transportation paying insurance on their car and working for someone else. They get a chance to be a productive citizens. This film was about as exploitive as a film can be. Its a way for the rich and middle-class sheeple to say see what happens when you try to help the poor? and it vindicates capitalistic arrogance.<br /><br />Why not a film that asks What happens when you take away everything a rich man has?',neg

At no time are either of them as entertaining as Roger Davis Pete Duel Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; although Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them career wise. Pretty blonde Mary Kornman (as Anne) grown-up from her days in Our Gang is a lovely interest for Wayne. She and Chandler have a couple of cute scenes with Wayne.

'Some kids are hiking in the mountains and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator. He puts on the gladiators helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers.<br /><br />This thing is just so utterly senseless its maddening. Heres a short list of things that dont make any sense:<br /><br />1) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet away!<br /><br />2) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream (What 100 feet away?) but dont investigate because theyre afraid theyll get lost.<br /><br />3) Another guy and a girl are walking around and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor. I mean what the...? First off thats just a really stupid thing to say secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together.<br /><br />4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing. Um yeah we kinda noticed shes wounded and not dead because shes up and walking around. But thanks for that tidbit of information.<br /><br />5) One girl is tied up in Demonicus lair and when someone attempts to free her she instead instructs this person to go and get help. Um look idiot if she set you free which would take about 5 seconds there would be no need to get help.<br /><br />And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods then they fight then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends then they wander around some more. Its just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through. <br /><br />None of these characters are sympathetic especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume scrunching his face up to look evil. He runs or should I say scampers around like hes gay. The special effects are comedic the acting is for the most part awful and nothing makes any sense.<br /><br />Overall maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue creating characters with actual likable personalities having some sort of logical flow to the action and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit. But no instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death.',neg
'This film has not exactly remained fresh in the minds of film buffs and its a crying shame. Its witty screenplay adaptation should have netted Oscar nominations for the great screenwriter I.A.L. Diamonds adaptation and Ingrid Bergmans flawless performance. It must have been an honor for Goldie Hawn at such a young age to work with Bergman looking more than a decade younger than her 54 years--fifty four! When shes on the screen it positively twinkles.<br /><br />This is a film which may appear dated at first but it actually made me wish I was around during the swingin sixties. Hawns fashions are as tacky as Bergmans are chic. (Thats one minor flaw--isnt her character a little too soignée for a gal who still lives with her sister? But then again would we have Ingrid any other way?) And who wouldnt want to hang out at a nightclub called The Slipped Disc?<br /><br />The best compliments I can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that I never saw and that it left me wanting more. Speaking of wanting more I wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor Rick Lenz? (He resembles Griffin Dunne in this film.) This was his film debut and I dont see any other major roles in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn shes done so much since then its easy to not be impressed but I cant imagine any other actor in the role either.<br /><br />Since the movie is based on a play the line delivery may seem a bit stage-y but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all. In fact I am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty-five years. Because this film represents a bygone era it has unjustly slipped from the consciousness of film buffs. It is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed. But dont let that stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer. Grade: A',pos
'Lets begin by acknowledging that there are arguably three types of horror films: good bad and utterly embarrassing reels that make the entire genre suffer in every way. Dark Harvest promises big with its Artisan DVD cover but rest assured that is where the show stops. Following a grueling opening montage we soon discover that the film consists of a very poorly written script extremely under qualified (even for a beginners film) acting disastrous lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously could no one afford anything more than a mask for the villain or did they just think it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers  so its good enough for us? Well it did not work at all to create a scary villain. At any rate this is one of the movies that make you check your watch sigh and curse your own gullibility. The timing in every scene is painful and the entire production has a middle school feeling to it (come to think of it I have seen better middle school stage productions right down to the special effects). Im trying to think of some way to end this review on a positive note so let me suggest that all copies of this train wreck be donated as drink coasters Frisbees wind chimes.......Id say go see your yourself but that would just be cruel.<br /><br />Check out the rest of this production companys reviews and youll find the same for every one of their movies. They claim to honor the contract between film and audience (i.e. please the fans) but all they have done is chuckle and dumped a load on our heads for the cash (of which I am sure they saw very little for this). <br /><br />Sorry people the high ratings and favorable reviews are obviously posted by those either directly or indirectly connected to this travesty. <br /><br />1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest possible rating. Giving it even one makes me angry.',neg
'A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentines Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? <br /><br />My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up sometimes slightly down. However I cant remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it upon its theatrical release I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an F letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night I cant remember what the heck I didnt like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it or maybe I just didnt get it. In any event I loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an A.<br /><br />It might sound ridiculous saying I didnt get a film like this but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks who was also responsible for 1998s Urban Legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film and the modus operandi of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the Valentines Day theme.<br /><br />Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However in light of the above the film is intentionally clichéd implausible and ludicrous. Its as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. Thats the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentines Day. Its an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for Valentines extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was self-aware. Valentines Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think Im reading too much into the film its worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he didnt want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something more adult.<br /><br />Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentines Day differs so much from its putative source material the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novels characters setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said While it was a fine book I didnt think it was the right story for a film. So instead the novel which is much dryer and more serious in tone was used as a launching pad a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentines Day. While those facts wont help purists familiar with the book like the film its helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. Its probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme.<br /><br />Blanks direction is impeccable visually. Valentines Day has a lush look throughout with complex deep colors interesting sets and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz as Adam Carr is involved in many of the funniest moments.<br /><br />While Valentines Day is no masterpiece its a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions.

'I can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company...<br /><br />Attended the UK premiere last night. Zane and Brook attended (they probably knew I was gonna be there) and are undoubtedly stars but what a turkey of a film. I felt sorry for them at times when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious thriller scenes.<br /><br />But perhaps I was missing the point. Perhaps an element of tongue-in-cheek was intended. If so pure genius. If not career genocide.<br /><br />On the plus side Zane always shines and Brook can actually act a little. As the other half said (as we ran out the cinema avec broken ribs) they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people! The scriptwriter however should be marooned.',neg
'Every time this film is on the BBC somebody in the Radio Times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state. I do not think this is the point of the film at all. The film parodies the spivs(small time criminals who ran the blackmarket) and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a Tory front organisation.<br /><br />Yes of course the film sends up the political/social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair societythey want to be British and muddle through rather than foreign.<br /><br />But I dont think they go back to being exactly like they were before.',pos
'This is movie is very touching. I dont care what people say about this movie this is a very good movie. The performances by Amitabh Bachchans role has the dying father is great because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and Akshay Kumer was great in his role as the spoiled Aditya Thakur. The supporting role of Shefali Shetty who played the role of Sumitra Thakur was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good in her small role she had in the movie. Ragpal Yadav as the brain-dead servant and Boman Irani as the show-off father-in law have a very good connection and the comedy scenes were hilarious. The direction is very good.',pos
'Season on the Brink is one of my favorite books of all time - an insightful unflinching look at Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time. So I made a point of watching this adaptation.<br /><br />It disappointed on every level. Dennehys performance was less than inspired and he seemed unprepared to play Knight - like he had accepted the role just prior to filming. The rest of the cast isnt much better.<br /><br />And it was obvious that this was ESPNs first movie. It was poorly directed poorly filmed and the lack of budget was obvious anytime games were being simulated (smaller gyms empty seats etc.) Skip this adaptation and read the book - it holds up well to this day!',neg

This movie was bad. By the end I thought oh my this is testing my patience.

I was out for a nice chick-date flick with my girl (my darling hubby likes watching movies together and I knew this wouldnt be his thing) something light and easy on the senses but this was one bad movie. We are intelligent and interesting movie watchers and this movie wasnt that. Annette Benning is a great actress she held her own. Bad. Bad.',neg
'I recommend families if possibleto show this to older children only.Some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle.Now that thats out of the waylet me explain about this movie.This is in reality a documentary of a male foxwho in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate.The beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music scoreis breath taking.You had better soak in as much of the scenery as possibleitll get ugly later.They gave both the fox and the vixen namesbut I cant remember what they are for the likes of me.He fights off this invading maleto win her love.They later on create a denand the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs;one of which is blind.There are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox familybut tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon.The first victim is the blind pupwho gets too close to a high tide and is washed away.The second victim is the motherwho while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole.She unknowingly walks into a foot trap.While trying to escape she rips off part of her footcausing her to bleed to death.The rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree.The male is now a single dadforced to take on the roll of mom and dad.He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life.It later proves not to be enoughwhen two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own; thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man.I wont spoil the surprising ending for youbut it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail.And it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through.I wanted to say that I saw this when it first came out in early 1980s when we had a thing called Showbiz cable.I was only 4 when I saw itbut I could never understand why they wouldnt let me see all of it.Now I know whyafter I secretly watched it when it came on Disneywhen I was 9.I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on.I was moved to tears.But as dark and ugly as it wasit serves a purpose.To let people what is going to these and other kinds of animalsand why they are endangered.This documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered speciesand I hoped it worked.Its not fake like the True life nature films by Disneythey dont teach about why animals are going extinct.The encroachment of landthe killing off of the foxes main preyand senseless killing of these beautiful animals;has resulted in them becoming endangered.I wish they would make sequel to this movie(Glacier Fox 2005)to see if theyre being treated better.Maybe have it be about a vixen pup named Teresa and her siblings growing up.This movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimesespecially when one of the parents suddenly dies.The surviving parent takes on the roll of bothand tries to teach the important lessons of life.It isnt always enough to protect them when theyre adultsespecially when some of their lives becomes ruined.Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves.Best all around soundtrack and musical score Ive ever heard.',pos
'I recently bought the DVD forgetting just how much I hated the movie version of A Chorus Line. Every change the director Attenborough made to the story failed.<br /><br />By making the Director-Cassie relationship so prominent the entire ensemble-premise of the musical sails out the window.<br /><br />Some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed. The shows hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to Cassies character.<br /><br />The overall staging is very self-conscious.<br /><br />The only reason I give it a 2 is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the films attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.',neg
'If asked how I would define the word  Shallow  I would reply  Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production  . If asked how I would define the phrase  Wasted potential  I would reply  Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production  . Bruckheimer productions are nearly always sure fire hits at the box office but nearly always receive critical pannings from the critics . Off the top of my head I can only think of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN getting a lot of critical acclaim . <br /><br />CRIMSON TIDE too received some begrudging acclaim from critics  it`s certainly one of Bruckheimer`s better films which alas isn`t saying much . The problem I had is the scenario that sets up the story : The Russians are fighting the Chechens and the conflict spreads through the whole of Russia leading to an ultra nationalist Russian to take over a nuclear missile base and threaten the West if they interfere . Maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but I found this set up very unconvincing . It`s not helped by some errors in geography like the French carrier Foch being in the Med ( Wouldn`t the Foch be better positioned in the black sea ? ) or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the Balkans  the first gulf war and even Vietnam . Once again the adjective  Very unconvincing  crept into my mind . The story does improve somewhat when the story proper - A battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - gets underway . Director Tony Scott does his best as do the cast  but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario . The worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid 1980s when WW3 was a real possibility - Nay probability - this film would have terrified me  but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means CRIMSON TIDE has little impact .',neg
'Yet another in the long line of Dont films of the late 70s and early 80s yet this one is much more than that. This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist. It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but its the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors/actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be. It seems Dr. Masters a rather ambitious female doctor has taken over his duties and begun to implement her own ideas. Each of the patients take on their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and flaws which make for highly entertaining interactions. There is the nymphomaniac the crazy old crone the woman with an unhealthy obsession with infants and a man who has reverted back to his childhood among others. There is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients running around loose and bodies piling up. If you are a fan of cheap 70s sleaze than this is the film for you!',pos

'Genteel softly spoken drama from Steven Spielberg was his first real venture into this genre. A departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare it paved the way for his 1993 success Schindlers List.<br /><br />Based upon Alice Walders Pulitzer Prize winning novel the story concerns a young girls arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving it loses its way through the fault of continuity and Menno Meyjes scrambling screenplay. The Color Purple is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walkers novel. A real shame that maestro Spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director.<br /><br />Performances are strong throughout with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which shes never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved. Danny Glover lends solid support though his Moses was a superior turn for him in Places in the Heart. The standout showing comes from the unheralded Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia the single minded fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising upper class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong.<br /><br />Quincy Jones ( co-producer with Spielberg Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn is sound as always while director of photography Allen Daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious Southern scenery.<br /><br />This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Wednesday January 15 1997 - Video',pos

'This one stood out for its originality. Im seriously tired of seeing Hindi movies that are a hotch-potch of a whole bunch of Hollywood and Brit movies. Some flaws were inevitable nonetheless this movie is a must-see. Suryas portrayal of the clean-cut conscientious cop (as opposed to the pot-bellied money-hungry ones that we normally see) was awesome. Hes come a long way from his work in Nerukku Ner. I liked the movie so much that I had to own it. Im not usually into the mindless violence type of movies somehow I actually felt for each character and therefore cant really bring myself to call it mindless violence. I do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil movies. I absolutely loved this movie for its lack of the same. ACP Anbuselvans reaction to loosing his wife is not overdone is heart-wrenching and makes me want to bawl my eyes out. There are certain times when Im watching a movie when I want to hit the FF button. Plenty of times Ive wanted to do that at a cinema hall. Never wanted to do so when watching this movie.

'Most movies I can sit through easily even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and Ive seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat its just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous even for the children in the audience. The plot drags on and on and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The witty parental remarks are disgusting not funny (I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to well a type of person people call a ho). Even though the movie is really short it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hated this movie. If children cant stand it I do not know how any adults can. I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. I HATED IT! So in summary do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! See a GOOD movie!<br /><br />1/10 stars--the lowest review I have ever given a movie.',neg
'I enjoyed the prequels and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3 however was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film and his character didnt seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. Chan is always likable but he seemed tired in this film. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who the villain was who the girl was (SPOILER ALERT) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was etc. I hope to see more movies from Tucker and Chan in their separate endeavors but not in any more Rush Hour sequels. Its just too tired. I recommend a rental but not a purchase.',neg

'Larry Fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum. Well the worst mistake evidently is the marketing of the movie and the way the DVD might have been targeted. Obviously this is not a true horror movie at least not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying. <br /><br />Wendigo is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young Miles. Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they cant comprehend. It is obvious that Kim the mother is a psychologist but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son. This is also a story of alienation. Its clear that the father George is a distant figure perhaps a workaholic who seems to be living in a different world.<br /><br />Miles fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country. That part of New York state with its winter landscape barren trees play havoc on the little boys imagination. It doesnt help that he encounters a strange figure in town it creates even more doubts in his young mind. Ultimately Miles world comes crashing down on him and he cant do anything even evoking the Wendigo spirit.<br /><br />The film is well paced and acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent no matter where movie she is in. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesnt understand. Erik Per Sullivan as Miles conveys the inner turmoil within him. I thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is Miles own take on whats going on around him. Finally John Spredakos is perfect as the menacing Otis a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out.<br /><br />Instead of putting this movie down future viewers should approach it with a open mind.',pos
'Kinda funny how comments for this film went consistently downhill now add mine. I think the script could have been saved by better acting and the acting by a better script. Together it was difficult to watch and I dont flinch from such subject matter.<br /><br />Sigourney was the best part (I thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this film offered to its genre) but even she lagged. Cant blame her who knows what takes were left on the cutting room floor by the director and/or editor. The whole movie had an okay thats good enough lets move on feel to it when I KNOW there was more to be mined from the actors and the script which did have some good lines and some interesting themes.<br /><br />I dont think this counts as a spoiler but a perfect example is the scene where Sigourney marches up to her sons supposed tormentors house and has this look on her face and I thought thats the face of someone who is overacting what its like to see someone living in a mobile home and sure enough next shot meant to shock us Im sure bully lives in a trailer as opposed to a nice house like hers.<br /><br />As many other posters have pointed out there are SO MANY better movies with similarly airy scripts about similarly messed up families that hit the notes better -- Celebration probably being the ultimate example that Ive seen.',neg
'***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or cant) be said about it SURFACE is superbly crafted. The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art. Conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents kids fantasy and/or fx fans). CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND by way of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON with a bit of JAWS and GODZILLA thrown in for good measure say. And there wasnt a single sour note struck acting-wise either; some surprisingly solid casting here. This series SURFACEd seemingly from out of nowhere and by sheer dint of its straightforward storytelling carried the viewer along for the better part of an entire season. All things considered a job very well done. I only hope it reSURFACEs next season...',pos
'I just saw this movie on Flix after timer-taping it. I grew up watching F Troop and had a major hard for Wrangler Jane so I was shocked literally shocked to find out after seeing this film that the degenerate homicidal nurse was Melody Patterson who looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed. I would never have guessed it was her in a million years. What the hell is she doing in a picture like this? I agree with the guys here that the movie lacks what its pushing. No sex no gore no tease. Its also a remake of the Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or thereabouts). Most of the action is tedious; the main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the crazed doctors house and basement and the neighborhood in general or being roughed up by the cop all of it boring and time-filling. Now if the Italians would have made this half the film would have been the Slingblade/Uncle Ernest/Jack Elam henchman fondling the unconscious nude girls. But you only get that for 20 seconds.',neg
'Kalifornia is one of my all-time favourite movies and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s. The film has a very stylish surface to it but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others. One of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances Brad Pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho named Early. Pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend her innocence is almost heart-breaking. Kalifornia has a very simple plot to it that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are alot of shocking scenes and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days. Kalifonia is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be and not only for it`s violence and gore.',pos
'As a huge fan of the original Operation Delta Force I thought Id pick this film up. I figured it couldnt be too bad. However heres a list of things I learnt from watching Operation Delta Force 4: Deep Fault.<br /><br />- The Delta Force despite being the elite in American armed forces are mostly mildly-overweight men in their late 30s and early 40s.<br /><br />- The Delta Force despite being the elite in American armed forces carry standard police issue pistols or AK-47s on their most important missions.<br /><br />- The Delta Force despite being the elite in American armed forces havent learnt that during stealth missions wearing bright red ski jumpers and running around in open spaces arent exactly going to keep you out of sight.<br /><br />- When you drop a Molotov cocktail into a tank it explodes externally like a grenade.<br /><br />- When you get hit by tank fire you can run away although the smoke caused may present minor difficulties for breathing.<br /><br />- You can die from one standard gun shot but you can also live despite being hit multiple times by a sniper rifle and a few times by an AK-47.<br /><br />- In hand-to-hand combat members of The Delta Force despite being the elite in American armed forces are regularly pummeled by railroad attendants.<br /><br />- If bad guys are approaching you while on a slow-moving train theres nothing to worry about - between the 4 of them they cant manage to figure out how to get an automatic weapon to fire automatically let alone hit anyone from 5 metres (16 feet) with at least 50 attempts between them.<br /><br />- If youre short on actors just recycle them - the bad guy from Operation Delta Force 1 plays a good guy called Mac in Operation Delta Force 4 and the guy who played Mac in Operation Delta Force 3 now plays Skip Lang a different good guy.<br /><br />- Its not OK for The Delta Force to shoot an unarmed terrorist even if hes attempting to reload his weapon to kill you.<br /><br />- Grenades explode on impact with the ground when thrown by members of The Delta Force. When thrown by non-Delta Force personnel they explode at exactly the point where the Delta Force members have thrown the grenades back at the bad guys.<br /><br />- Tanks can drive faster than standard trucks.<br /><br />- Militias and personal armies use the exact same chopper that the UN used in Operation Delta Force 1.<br /><br />- When a chopper arrives a bad guy in that chopper cannot see you if you lie face-down.<br /><br />- Shooting someone multiple times in the chest will cause minor damage. Stabbing that person in the knee will kill them inside 5 seconds.<br /><br />- The Delta Force steal cars from old people to get around when in foreign countries because the US Military do not provide them with any means of transport. This may also explain why they caught public transport.<br /><br />As you can see this is not really the finest moment in film-making but its good for a laugh.',neg
'Its almost embarrassing to say I even saw this movie. I mean it doesnt take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects lots of blood and gore some scary moments and a decent plot. Does House of the Dead 2 do any of these things right? No not one. Of course its not as bad as its predecessor from Uwe Bowle and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me.<br /><br />The dialog in this movie is notorious with such lines as What do you do for a living? in response I kill zombies and I was never a disk jockey I was a soldier. The special effects are embarrassing even for a made for TV movie I mean seriously the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack. The army base in this movie is a parking garage with a desk and a open gated room. This movie is so low budget that they couldnt even get co-ed locker rooms. In fact it seems like this entire movie was filmed in a middle school.<br /><br />Also why is it that the all the female soldiers in this movie are models? And for that matter why is everyone in this movie so clueless at to what is going on that they simply just stand around letting the zombies kill them. Heck one guy even trys to give food to the zombie.<br /><br />Overall this movie makes even the worst of Scifi Channel movies looks fantastic.',neg

'The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of its release that impressed me so much back in 1982 it just blew my mind Id never seen anything like that! However although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific it was the story itself the music score  the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic. <br /><br />Movies dont get any better than this! In the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this point its a mystery until the thing reveals itself. <br /><br />However the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha Christie who dunnit ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as the members dont know which one of their team is really an alien. Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown.<br /><br />After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in the Thing dont carry the same weight as it did in 1982 but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast.',pos

With its hot chemistry sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs i mean timeless classic like (Ive Had) The Time of My Life & the wonderful Shes Like The Wind makes this movie.

I love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. But saying this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great but Patrick Swayze scenes makes this. I love the songs dancing and everything about it but it isnt Dirty Dancing. Like I said its an amazing chick flick. Please let there be a 3rd because I love to see what happens with Patricks character Johnny. Jennifer character could have been more sexy but hey Patrick makes up for that if you know what I mean!!!

'For the viewer who comes upon it long after its making Winchester 73 has something in common with Casablanca. While you watch it you get this feeling that youre looking at a string of clichés encountered so often in the genre; then you realise that the clichés became clichés only after being copied from this particular film and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great. In other words its a seminal work.<br /><br />Winchester 73 is a joy to watch. The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable but mostly because youve seen them copied so many times in later movies and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you. The dialogue the pacing and Manns direction are excellent. Stewart shines in particular and if youre a fan this is a must-see but he is not alone in delivering a good performance. Remarkably many of the most thoughtful and/or witty lines go to minor characters. Because this makes these characters (much) more than cardboard cutouts it lent additional realism to the film. <br /><br />This is a remarkably underrated film and well worth keeping an eye out for. The DVD also contains an interview with Stewart which provides some background on the film.',pos
'This is a ravishing yet spare adaption of Thomas Manns novelette of the same title. Dirk Bogarde gives his finest screen performance - he himself believed so. The dialogue is minimal so his face must register the nuances of his anguished character - a composer (a writer in the novelette - the only major alteration) who travels to Venice in 1910. Visconti revels in the portrayal of beauty its passing and the whiff of decay beneath.Trained as an opera director Visconti blends Mahlers music and imagery seamlessly in his finest film since The Leopard (another stunning film which greatly influenced Coppolas Sicily in the Godfather).',pos
'As a true lover of film I must advise you to avoid this appalling effort God knows how funding was approved Seriously this is one cinematic experience which delivers zero dramatic tension and plods along until nothing happens again and again and again  The only connectivity is two scares which at least keep you awake Possiby the worst film I have ever witnessed and the acting by the female lead is bordering on criminal intent. One blessing with modern technology you can fast forward and watch it on 12x and it will only last 25 minutes  And you wont miss any of the plot<br /><br />No idea how people find this at all interesting and some are giving it high marks !',neg
'This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but thats where it ends. It seemed like a lackluster Set It Off meets The West. The plot barely made any sense. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. There were too may unnecessary things going on that didnt pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along. There were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more sense as well as the directing. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If youre only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you.',neg
'Nicolas Roeg ? He directed the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW didn`t he ? Strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on BBC television at the weekend which did tonight`s screening of COLD HEAVEN no favours what so ever . <br /><br />You see it`s impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DON`T LOOK NOW since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN I thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been substituted instead of a dead child  in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around Venice wearing a red anorak . This doesn`t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there`s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it`s not explained in any great depth . In fact very little is explained in COLD HEAVEN which ruins the movie <br /><br />People have mentioned the rather poor production values of COLD HEAVEN and it`s impossible not to notice them . If I didn`t no different I would have thought this was a TVM since it`s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence . Roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesn`t help the movie at all . One can`t help feeling Roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen <br /><br />Cheap production values  disinterested directing and a really bizarre premise and screenplay make for a bad movie',neg
'This is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of Charles Vidor. Rita Hayworth (Rusty Parker)Charlie Chan in Egypt sang and danced with Gene Kelly(Danny McGuire) Anchors Away Danny McGuire owned a night club in Brooklyn N.Y. and was in love with Rusty Parker who was a dancer in his club along with Phil Silvers(Genius)Coney Island who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with Danny Rusty. Otto Kruger (John Coudair)Duel in the Sun played the role as a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided Rusty Parker was going to be his top model. Jerome Kerns music is heard through out the entire picture and the song Long Ago & Far Away is the theme music for this musical. This film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during WW II which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant hits and their careers exploded on the silver screen for many many years. Great Musical and a film you will not want to miss this is truly a great Classic Film. Enjoy',pos
'Hitting the ground running the film begins with THREE murders in a row. No plot no characters no motivation; the second murder happens off screen and that victims severed head is actually used to quite efficiently bludgeon the third victim to death! This is a high point. But the Lewises are obviously smart enough to lead with strength; soon theyre covering up botched dialogue scenes with detective voice-over and shooting endless snappy repartee in ugly wide shot. By now this Betacam productions horror atmosphere is rapidly giving way to an insurance infomercial vibe with the monumental (and rather endearing) plainness of the leads skewing things further in that direction. Shlub cop investigates meat cleaver guy slaughters repeat climaxing early with a memorable severed-finger-in-the-salad gag. Only how the hell did the fingers get in the salad? And wasnt the Blood Cults purpose to collect the appendages they severed? When the GORE stops making sense you know youre in trouble. And without spoiling the big nonsensical twist ending just take my word for it: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep cathode-tube-smashing impulse. The basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and get on with your life.',neg

'OK I really dont have too much to say about this film other than this: I have seen over 4000 films in my life and more than 2300 of those were horror films.

Romeros DAWN OF THE DEAD) I can tell you without the slightest hesitation that Todd Sheets ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute worst horror film I have ever seen.<br /><br />There is simply nothing positive I can say about this film. The acting the dialogue the directing the make-up the music... Every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even released.<br /><br />Even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist please heed my warning and DO NOT waste your time on this garbage.

'When a movies claim to fame is that Martin Sheens younger less known brother stars in it you know its not gonna be a real good one. Soultaker is a low budget silly film about a group of 20-something year olds being pursued by an angel of death. Its a stupid movie but it is pretty entertaining and even somehow slightly likable in its stupidity.<br /><br />The plot in the film is very small and its stretched about as far as it possibly can be. Joe Estevez isnt much of an actor so luckily for the audience he has very few lines and his role in mostly just him walking. This movie really feels like it was trying to be a horror/fantasy franchise considering it has the same plot layout as a slasher. 4 characters each dies one at a time...will any live? Who really cares. Though it sounds like I hated this I didnt.

PG-13 for language violence and nudity.',neg
'Significant Spoilers! <br /><br />This is a sick disturbing movie... just like the sick twisted director Jennifer Chambers Lynch who also wrote it. I dont even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It is not the fault of the actors for sure. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. It is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind.<br /><br />I do know that I will never ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is a sick twisted foul-mouthed foul-thinking deviant. She looks speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs who spent 20 years doing hard time. You can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the DVD special features section of Surveillance: The Watched are Watching. You can see and hear her for yourself. She was every bit as bad as I had envisioned from the writing of this movie.<br /><br />Im not shocked by bad language although this director certainly talks like a sailor. This goes far beyond simple bad language; worse than any p0rn film. The level of implied sado-violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p0rn standards. This perverse disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says. Another reviewer found the description I was seeking. This is a snuff film.<br /><br />Be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending. This director/writer is truly a sick person. I cant believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie much less pay her for it. You can be assured that I will never ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with. In the thousands of movies I have watched and collected there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott. She is offensive beyond anyone I have ever seen connected with filming a movie before. There have been some bad directors and writers but none could compare to her sick twisted mind.<br /><br />When I saw this movie which was just one murder rampage after another. Once it got past the hotel murder... then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks... the vacation family with the bad parents (who had no business being in the presence of children)... followed by the drug addicts.... the movie then proceeded to the (even more) twisted deviant serial killers.<br /><br />As I saw the serial killers reveal themselves I began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie. Those were my actual thoughts as I watched this movie. I fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind... because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise it turned out to be the director. When I saw and heard what she had to say on the DVD I realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose. On the DVD she was indeed the sick twisted person I had envisioned writing such a disturbing film.<br /><br />While the little girl (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins truly stole the show... I cant believe that her real-life parents would have tolerated this sick foul-mouthed director to be anywhere near their daughter.<br /><br />This movie is disturbing sick offensive twisted and the director-writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility.<br /><br />As far as the ending of the movie goes... the alternate ending should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal. There was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character. Im stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer. That trailer is not representative of the movie you will see.<br /><br />Other than the child... every character in this movie was a sick murderous twisted perverse violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer-director who created them. But if you watch it carefully even the parents of the vacationing family; the sick cops taking pot shots; the serial killers posing in alternate roles; cops in the station; and even the station dispatcher... every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually twisted violent pervert. Im not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the Canadian town in the Special Features section of the DVD.<br /><br />This writer-director has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps. The only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. Watch closely and you will see this in every character. Then listen to the director-writer talk on the DVD Special Features section and you will understand what Im telling you about her mental state and psychological issues. She wouldnt be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a Hollywood film making family.<br /><br />Fortunately Jennifer Chambers Lynch does not have much of a filmography... less than a handful of things. Since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles I dont think well have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad director David Lynch helps her out. Id recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with... and Im not too sure her dads films would be any better.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.',neg
'After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours from primarily two points of view. <br /><br />The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece and Mandras went off to fight. After German intervention Greece is conquered and the island Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage.) This of course was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands. As they got to know their occupiers they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbours. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britains Channel Islands in which this was a major issue. Once Mandras returns to the island Pelagia is torn between them.<br /><br />The second background issue is the Italian occupation itself which I thought was quite realistically portrayed. First was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened (and was quite funny in fact. I loved the line we would rather surrender to this Germans dog than to you Italians.) The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as believable. The Italian Army was never enamoured of their German ally and never enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops on the island simply cant understand) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the Germans. It was all quite well done I thought.<br /><br />It falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish but still deserves praise.<br /><br />7/10',pos
'Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing united in one horror film; that always sounds like a terrific plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like The Flesh and the Fiends and From Beyond the Grave pairing up in a mid-70s satanic themed exploitation flick. How can this possibly go wrong? Well unfortunately it can. To my deepest regret Land of the Minotaur can hardly even be called mediocre and that in spite of the cast the exotic setting the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise. In a remote little area in Greece more particularly near an archaeological site multiple tourists vanish because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire-breathing Minotaur statue. Cushing who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns. That is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area Father Roch - the priest of a couple of towns before) - decides to investigate. Land of the Minotaur is a boring and extremely slow-paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesnt bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details. The titular Minotaur for example is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance. Instead the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises. The only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of Donald Pleasance. His portrayal of rude bossy and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always.',neg

'Indian burial ground: If those three words appear anywhere in a real-estate listing look for a different neighborhood. A young couple with a young daughter and a toddler-age son move into a Maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery--and after a l-o-o-o-ng hike an ancient Indian burial ground. Seems the Indian ground can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead--if you dont mind having a raving hell beast for a pet. It can do the same for dead people--if you dont mind having a homicidal zombie around the house.<br /><br />Throw in a busy two-lane blacktop speeding big rigs a well-meaning (if somewhat dim) old neighbor and one kid who really doesnt get enough supervision and I think you can figure out what happens from there--an over-the-top illogical mess which in all fairness does offer up a few scares.<br /><br />Well there are worse Stephen King adaptations (such as Maximum Overdrive which King also directed).

'While I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (due to its horrid production values) it appears like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt Scrappy-Doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children (and this includes the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm). Whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters with it?! Whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny annoying and grates on the nerves--and this is only in the BETTER episodes!! After many years it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess! I can see why in the live-action Scooby-Doo movie they made the villain Scrappy-Doo--since practically everyone hates him!',neg
'Its proof that movie makers and their financiers treating their audience with contempt isnt a new phenomena as it was done as early as the 1940s and HOUSE OF Dracula is a great example . Youd think having a film with Dracula  the wolf man and Frankensteins monster the producer would dictate to the screenwriter to have all three appear in a scene . They had a chance with HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN then when they had a second bite of the cherry they blew it again with HOUSE OF Dracula . To lose one chance is a misfortune  to lose two smacks of cynical money making <br /><br />Its obvious the producers are beyond caring . Larry Talbot turns up again even though he was shown to die in the previous film which sums up the cynicism of the franchise . It also shows what a poor screenplay it is and were mistreated to some awful plot turns like Talbots condition being cured by a special type of plant which will soften his skull . Im thinking screenwriter Edward T Lowe might have had his skull softened if this is the type of stuff he comes up with <br /><br />Director Erie C Kenton cant improve on the script and throws in a few spanners of his own . For example Talbot is startled to see Dr Edelmann snatch a lift on a cart but nonchalantly watches Edelmann climb a wall and jump in to the château courtyard . One cant help thinking Talbots reaction shots were mistakenly switched round at the editing stage <br /><br />Lon Chaney Jnr is famous for his roles in horror movies but didnt have much of a career outside them . Perhaps thats down to the fact hes not a good actor and here he commits the worst type of acting - being very wooden . Its not entirely his fault though because all the characters spout rather awful dialogue and are all rather wooden due in part to Kentons lackluster directing <br /><br />HOUSE OF Dracula feels a million miles away from James Whale 1931 film and its sequel from 1935 and would have been a very sad note to end on . But ironically Universal decided to make one more movie to wrap up their franchise with a horror comedy starring Abbot and Costello',neg
'Extremely pinching vision of a war situation where the couple from Vargtimmen (ok they have different names and initial situations but the actors are the same) gets caught in the crossfire of two fronts. The depiction of the fighting parties as faceless superordinate authorities are often captured in sublime surreal pictures and draws interesting parallels to Orwells 1984 even if Bergman thwarts this context on a personal level of a slowly burgeoning conjugal war. That is why countless fundamental and philosophical questions towards Evas and Jans marriage are relevant and essential while the threat and danger from the outside tears open an abyss in the inside which was toilsomely covered with lambencies before. An intense allegory on the fragile facades of civic conventions.',pos

'Since Paul Kersey was running short of actual relatives to avenge the third installment in the Death Wish saga revolves on him returning to New York to visit an old war buddy. He arrives only to find out that Brooklyn entirely changed into a pauperized gangland and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously terrorize all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building. Kersey strikes a deal with the local police commissioner conquers the heart of his blond attorney blows away numerous villains with an impressive Wildey Magnum gun and gradually trains & inspires the petrified New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Okay theres no more point in defending the Death Wish series after seeing part three. The 1974 original was a masterpiece that revolved on the social drama as much as it did on the retribution and even though it was pure exploitation part two still had quite a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were a logically linked to those occurring in the first. Number three frequently feels like a totally separate franchise. Apparently Kersey isnt an architect anymore hes ten times more social and talkative than he used to be and suddenly nobody not even the police is against vigilante actions anymore? All these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson reduced their Death Wish success to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series with a death toll that gigantically increases with each episode armory that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that get nastier sleazier meaner and a lot harder to kill. However the gentlemen didnt seem to realize that the non-stop spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that referred to Death Wish 3 as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation. This description couldnt be more spot-on as the script tiredly moves itself from one repugnant execution sequence to the next. Particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete orgy of gunfire explosions and executions realized through improvised homemade measures. Yi-Haaa! This entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast including Martin Balsam (Psycho 12 Angry Men) as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet Ed Lauter (Family Plot The Longest Yard) as the slightly unorthodox copper and even Alex Winter (from Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure!) in his debut role as one of the thugs.',neg
'On the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic concerning the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood George Lucas American Graffiti we have Cooley High. An adaptation of sorts by one Eric Monte co creator of the popular 1970s CBS sitcom Good Times.<br /><br />Cooley High was and is viewed as a black version of American Graffiti.Instead of central California as in American Graffiti we have the black slum of Chicagos Cabrini Green as the backdrop for the story here. Instead of America in 1962 Cooley High is situated in 1964.The movie stars Welcome Back Kotters Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman as the movie main protagonists and its main characters. It has Garrett Morris playing the principal who tries to keep Jacobs and Turmans charactersnamed Coceise and Preach out of trouble a great deal of the time.<br /><br />You know I would like to say that Cooley High is a worthy comparison piece to American Graffiti or that it is a great film on its own but I cant. The problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film couldnt or wouldnt hide the sad underside of black life in America.Having the film in the Cabrini Green part of Chicago doesnt help things.<br /><br />Neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here. When Coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a college he finds his little brother has thrown down a toilet. When the gang visits the Chicago Zoo one of the gang named Pooter has manure thrown on him by an ape. When the Turmans characterPreach is being chased by two hoodlums in the school hangout(A dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at) he opens the door of the girls bathroom while a girl is relieving herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom! The high school the homes of the characters the bathrooms just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty.<br /><br />If that wasnt enough there was the rough display of humor in the film. The use of violence and profanity in the film. Cooley High may be an coming of age film but it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate American Graffiti so much.<br /><br />Motown Records had a hand in making the film. The companys music was part of the films soundtrack. But even here you get a sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before a million times over. Not that they werent great songs within themselves but black musicof that time period was more than just Motown.Especially in Chicago. The song nearing the end of the movie by the Spinners G.C. Cameron was not all that impressive. There have been better Motown ballads that have been done by better Motown artists than Cameron without question.<br /><br />The last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film Cooley High aimed to be American Graffiti. It shows that Preachan intelligent but underachieving student went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Monte may have patterned himself as Turmans character. The last shot of film shows Preach running away from Coceises funeral held on a dark rainy afternoon and all the bleakness that Cooley High came to represent. Eric Monte through Preach and that final scene had one little lesson for all of us when watching Cooley High and for the love of the past. Dont look back.',neg
'At times I really wonder when I look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than I have. Ive just seen it... and liked it. Not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film!<br /><br />The film needs some patience yes. And yes the main character is REALLY annoying but that Im sure is by intention.<br /><br />Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home. Most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music. This movie definitely doesnt fit as background noise.<br /><br />And no. Good directing doesnt mean having five laughs or explosions a second. Good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together. And while that doesnt work out perfectly at least I think it works quite good.<br /><br />I liked the photography and sets even if they brink on the surreal at times. The opening scene is really special.<br /><br />I also liked the acting  Guillaume Depardieu is NOT playing Pierre. He is acting the role of a Pierre who is himself playing a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be he is a presumptuous and self-righteous idiot a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect. That even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself.<br /><br />People are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff: No character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone.<br /><br />And even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen: Remember that Isabelle fled from a war zone - and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war most likely Bosnia (which was still going on when the film was produced). At least thats what is hinted at by the story Isabelle tells Pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover which is surrounded by books on Bosnia.',pos
'I saw this film 12 years ago on TNT. It was Susanah Yorks Birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this film on TV since. I took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented Jim Dale as Lusty the sailor. I believe that Dale now does the narration of the Harry Potter books on Casette but anyway he is quite funny. This is a fast paced comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go through their film collection and consider restoring and releasing this film to DVD. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as Lord Fopington Ian Bannen is also quite humorous as Ramble the sailor.

Paltrow is as wooden as they get. This could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp.

Lo and behold for I bring to you: Santa Claus the most helplessly messed up family film since ... well ever. <br /><br />From the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their insipid theme songs (seriously this segment is nearly 20 freakin minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the thrilling conclusion in which Merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day (dont mind him hes from Barcelona) this is childhood trauma at its finest. And no matter how hard I try no matter how many different therapists I visit I just... cant... get... those... reindeers...laughter...out... of... my ... head! <br /><br />Avoid this mind-bending piece of trash like youd avoid a sex-starved whale during mating season. Still if flaming gay demons with a serious case of the overacting flu are something for you I guess you should give it a try. But really this movie isnt worth your time and mental health.',neg
'A lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in Leon then other parts felt like some other movie I dont know which but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie. It was kind of nice to watch but it would have been fantastic! if the story would have been more original. The theme little girl bad assassin from Leon is just tweaked a little. The opening scenes are really good :-) It is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen in the movies :-) My biggest problem was to remember which parts was from Leon Nikita and if they where from the French or American version. If you have not seen Leon then this is a good movie. If you liked this movie then I can recommend Leon.<br /><br />Best Regards /Rick',neg
'i bought this rental return for $1.99 at hollywood and overpaid. i didnt expect much but thought it would be something to fall asleep by at least. i quickly noted the very weak storyline the gross overacting by everyone (no one talks like that except in cartoons) and the seemingly lets-make-it-up-as-we-go-along direction. i know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed by it and i feel certain that it did not help any careers. as for this movie buff of 35 years it has now provided a ready answer for the worst-film-youve-ever-seen question.<br /><br />',neg
'This is not a good movie but I still like it. The cat Clovis is gold in a jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves - intrinsically opposed to the evil Sleepwalkers. I think there is more to this movie than people realize basically it is very harsh but this brusqueness can sometimes be good. Its got the corny lines the abrupt ending and a comedic element conveyed by the bumbling policemen.<br /><br /> Did anyone find the incestuous element a bit disturbing? Ultimately this movie is casually and randomly acrimonious which is quite effective I liken it to Psycho - the relationship between the mother and son the changing of protagonists. I think the abruptness works also this is not a movie that you want them to lengthen it only works if its short.<br /><br />Im still not sure whether the director lacked depth or whether he did these things with purpose we know Stephen King has ability yet I havent even read his books only seen some of his movies.<br /><br />Anyway I liked it. If you like harsh corny movies with 80s overtones just watch it. but dont expect too much. It really is so bad its good.',pos
'This was such a beautiful film. Such an amazing performance from Joseph and Brad. Very innocently written and performed. A must see !! I cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie. This is a movie that every family should sit down with their children to watch it does teach us all a very important lesson in life and how we should be approaching the harsh subject of AIDS how we should be teaching our children to cope with it and people around them. Not only with AIDS but with any terminal illness. I hadnt even heard of this movie until I scrolled through t.v. one day and happen to run across it. I recommend everyone to watch this just dont forget your box of tissues. More movies should be made like this one. Extremely heartwarming.',pos
'Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy first on The Daily Show and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer a middle aged man living a quiet lonely life. Andy is a little odd but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. One night while socializing with his co-workers for the first time Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers David (Paul Rudd) Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But its clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. And so begins Andys quest into adulthood. Andy is the quintessential innocent and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. Some of the humor is crude gross out stuff but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. In addition I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. Im not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; its a rolling in your seats comedy. Still every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison would be The Wedding Crashers from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. I particularly loved the ending of the film which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick. Without giving anything away it reminded me of Something About Mary. Very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend.',pos
'This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I have seen. It shows what us what we in a democratic society take for granted and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing. The acting in the film is superb sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization and not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) making the interrogator fully dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of in the round theater. Which does not add or take away from the emotion of the action. This movie seeks to open the eyes of the viewer and Id say they have made a success of that goal.',pos
'This one took me by surprise because i had often been disappointed by Adrian Pasdar in the past but he caught the perfect balance in this performance avoiding both farce and pathos while delivering humour and real emotions. The always-wonderful Julie Waters is terrific here and anyone who has not yet scene her in 1983s Educating Rita should rent it immediately (marvelous film). The rest of the supporting characters are well-played as well many marvelously eccentric without going over the top. This one is fun.',pos
'Scary.. Yes Scary!! Jam-packed with nudity (from fat people to skinny people) Maslin Beach takes place on a nudist beach in S.A.<br /><br />I first saw this film two years ago - its safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day. This film was horrible! Hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity! This movie hit its lowpoint with one of the new-age characters staring down between a girls legs.<br /><br />Girl: Youre not going to find God in there! Guy: Nah But I think I found heaven.<br /><br />Steer clear of this one unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting adultery and the process of superlguing ones genitals together.

'Saw this at the video store and thought Id give it a try. Sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. That was it. The characters looked good and the actor who played Noel was the most convincing though he didnt have any heavy time in the movie. I find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating but this is one in a minute number that gets it my book. As the movie went along I kept wanting it to get better but to no avail. Asthetically it was good. The sound and lighting was good but the acting in this film killed it for me. It was like watching a low grade soap opera. I just kept saying I cant believe they released this move like this. I paused several times out of sheer unbelief that the acting was that bad. Theres so much I want to say but Ill just say this everything else for the most part was good it was the acting as a final cut that really did this film in.',neg
'Intelligent nail-biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in America (when life imitated the film). A nuclear power plant employee in Southern California is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant. Ostensibly a stuck valve problem a TV news-crews film shows that it was an accident verging on disastrous proportions--and worse that safety conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars a cover-up that endangers everyones lives. The movie occasionally gets too technical (especially in the second-half) and could use more human interplay however the performances by Jack Lemmon Jane Fonda (as a puff-piece news-woman in the right place at the right time) and Michael Douglas (as a freelance cameraman) are superb. The throwaway bits involving nuclear protesters is both entirely accurate and bitterly satirical and the news-biz (with its corporate structure and vapid yes-men) is vividly captured. ***1/2 from ****',pos
'Night of the Living Homeless was a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11. Obviously a parody of various zombie movies most notably Dawn of the Dead this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains.<br /><br />Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he out of the goodness of his heart gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park until the town is completely overrun with them. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming I dont have any change!! Unfortunately the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. Then he becomes one of them asking everyone for change.<br /><br />The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately homeless people break into the mans house and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However he fails several times as he shoots himself in the jaw in the eye in the chest in the neck in the shoulder screaming horribly until he finally dies. This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in Fantastic Easter Special two weeks ago.<br /><br />Meanwhile a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem the property values have nosedived thus the bank has foreclosed on his house making him homeless. Randy immediately turns on him holding the gun to the mans head. When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out Randy pulls the trigger.<br /><br />In Evergreen the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to South Park and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. The boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica California.<br /><br />The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10',pos
'This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The Avengers held this dubious honor but no longer. The acting in Jill the Ripper is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes. It doesnt know whether it wants to be an S&M flick or a really bad thriller. Only watch under extreme intoxication or if youre bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction. This script should be reworked into a porn it wouldnt take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life. A porn even a bad porn wouldnt do the damage to Dolf Lundgrens career the way that this movie has.',neg
'Another British cinema flag waver. Real garbage on offer here once again. I cannot understand (and I am British) why this over the top patriotic nonsense was ever made. EIGHT years mark you from when the second world war had actually ended! Other commenters here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage. This is extremely poorly observed. The archive footage is in abundance. Model aircraft swing from wires in the action scenes like so many childrens kites in the wind. The usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole Malta event. Guinness must have his worst acting performance ever. The shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable. Hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area. Ealing made many great movies. This clearly is not one of them. They should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot!',neg
'Dahmer a young confused man. Dahmer a confusing movie. Granted I had a few beers while watching the movie but that doesnt explain why I got so bored by this flick.<br /><br />Its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying and theres no real storyline with a beginning and an end the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie. The inbetween stuff which would be the movie is just boring images and a waste of time. <br /><br />We never see actual murders everything is just a bunch of insinuations. Sometimes you even just get a feeling that Dahmers dreaming the entire thing but you know he isnt since its<br /><br />based on a true story and this actually happened at least most of it. But what happened? Its not easy to tell.<br /><br />I do not encourage people to waste time on this movie.

'This was recently on AMCs vibrant movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of Voyage to the Earths Core and Mysterious Island. I was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year olds comic book. Be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the Pterdactyls wings when they grasp Ogar a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers. The ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in People that Time Forgot. Dont waste your time.',neg
'Im a huge classic film buff but am just getting in to silent movies. A lot of silent films dont hold my attention but Show People is a notable exception.<br /><br />Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this picture. Davies in particular shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously.<br /><br />Show People is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era. The movie captured my attention immediately and I actually forgot that it was a silent film. (I know that doesnt make much sense but thats what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary.<br /><br />Show People is a perfect introduction to silent films. It is a fast paced interesting film with two of the silent eras best stars. Add in the satire of Hollywood and Show People should be on the must see list for all classic film buffs.',pos
'For a while I was caught in the trap where I found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that I liked them. Fatty Drives the Bus is the exception. It is the truth. It is the best bad movie ever.<br /><br />The badness of this movie seems to come naturally. Halfway through Satans opening monologue the word Hell appears at the bottom of the screen. The glamorous Bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress. It takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other FOREVER to walk down the stairs. Jesus walks to a funk soundtrack.<br /><br />Anyways Fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a seniors film project. But its the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful. You get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad but never forced it.<br /><br />Never to be duplicated in wonder Fatty delivers. Highly highly recommended.',pos
'Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-running internet only fan film done completely for the love of the series and a must watch for fans of Trek. The production quality is extremely high for a fan film although sometimes you can tell that theyre green-screenin it. This doesnt take away from the overall experience however. The CGI ships are fantastic as well as the space battle scenes... On the negative side I could tell in the earlier episodes (and even occasionally in the newer ones) that some of the actors/actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles but once again this doesnt take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of Star Trek. The cast and crew have truly come up with something special here and as a wholeI would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.',pos

'Had Ned Kelly been born later he probably would have won a Victoria Cross at Gallipolli. such was Neds Bravery.<br /><br />In Australia and especially country Victoria the name Ned Kelly can be said and immediately recognised. In Greta he is still a Hero the life Blood of the Town of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created but in Mansfield they still havent forgotten that the three policeman that he murdered were from there.<br /><br />Many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. From the Old Melbourne Gaol where he was hanged to the Post office he held up in Jerilderie. A cell he was once held in in Greta is on display in Benella and the site of Ann Jones Hotel the station and even the logs where he was captured in Glenrowan can be visited.<br /><br />Evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found all over Victoria in police records and even in the Sash that Ned was awarded with for rescuing Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is wrong and whats left out would further justify Neds actions. The Horse that Ned stole was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man who Ned boxes with after getting out of jail). Ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldnt have stolen it.<br /><br />The Jerilderie Letter is more than what has been stated before. It is not self justification it is Neds biography an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting. So go ahead and read it watch the movie and then make up your mind about what Ned stood for.',pos
'Why did I have to go out and buy (yes buy!) JACK FROST 2: REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN??? Maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement? But Im guessing its because I kind of enjoyed the first JACK FROST. It was a silly but funny horror-comedy which had some okay effects by Screaming Mad George. That and the fact that on the back-cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all). So I thought: if its as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter/gore in it it should be fun right? Well I was so dead wrong! <br /><br />Let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot. I mean a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas??? As much as I love the premise I really hated the movie. First of all: while the first JACK FROST looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all) this sequel has the look and feel of a third-rate soap-opera. It has this way too slick shot-on-video look. The lighting is just plain awful (bright white spots for the day look and stupid colors like blue and green at night). The acting... well dont even go there. The dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (that Jamaican man was just moronic saying man after every sentence). And when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman all I could think of was a seventh-rate Chucky from CHILDS PLAY spewing dumb and supposedly witty one-liners before he kills someone.<br /><br />The best joke was were one guy asks Why are you talking to your watch?. And the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful Asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). Oh yeah and that little scene over the end-credits with those two Japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too. But the worst thing about this movie was: Where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about? There were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings. A lot of people were killed off in original ways here but all off-screen. Like Ive read in many other comments there were indeed nice set-ups to a head explosion a crushed body eyes being poked out tongue ripped out... but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all. That frontal shot of that British guy being impaled (from the back-cover of the DVD) wasnt even in the movie. I only saw that particular killing filmed from the back (meaning I didnt see sh!t!). I was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen and then I get to see nothing?!?! What a let-down! Could it be that I saw a cut version of the movie? That would be a shame cause only a decent amount of splatter-fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. Seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didnt cut it for me. Speaking of those snowballs: they were done very poorly. They made MUNCHIES look like state-of-the-art animatronics. But I guess that was the whole point of it. At some point the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad CGI. Boy you really have to see it to believe it. Best is to not see it actually cause this flick is just too bad (okay I did laugh with it for it kept getting worse and worse). Just stick with the first JACK FROST (1996) and youll be okay (just bare in mind that its a pretty silly horror-comedy but fun in its own right).<br /><br />Its funny but writer/director Michael Cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after JACK FROST 2 and then focused on writing. Turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for THE I INSIDE (starring Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (starring John Cusack). So the man seems to have some talent after all.<br /><br />Now it would be far too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest rating possible. So I say one point for that naked Asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies. Way to go Mr. Cooney!',neg
'A woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides. Then again are these really suicides? It seems as though theres a ghost on the loose. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that hides its face and it moves about with its head or arms twisted this way or that making for a very weird looking specter. Recurrent theme music plays from unexpected locations to announce the arrival of the ghost and bizarre sound effects--which resemble the sound of small twigs being snapped--always accompany this hapless spirit. Does any of this sound familiar? Well if youve seen a few Asian horror movies in the last 10 years it should. Borrowing heavily and unabashedly from The Ring One Last Call and a few other recent horror hits this film tries to carry an uninteresting and worn-out plot to a climax but weve seen it all before. Avoid it unless youre desperate or havent seen any other Asian horror movies in the last 10 years.',neg
'Literally every aspect of this science-fiction low-budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors contemporaries and those to follow. Bad special effects a weak storyline ridiculous amounts of blood and gore annoying and pointless characters all that you can expect. Attack of the Sabretooth is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering Smilodon cats for an attraction. The cats escape and begin to kill people the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats.<br /><br />Special effects-wise the film is about an average achievement given its budget. The sabretooths are portrayed through poor CGI. Amazingly though the cats look more realistic in an up-close detailed shot rather than the longer more distant shots where the CGI is better concealed. Their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful. Just as youd expect they attack rip off some arms and legs and leave very little behind. This is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock.<br /><br />The plot and characters are just as horrendous. We have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt. And take it very VERY seriously. Even so much as to trespass on private property tamper with security systems and steal. Why are they taking a simple game so seriously? Did I miss something? Was there money involved? Or were they sent to do it? I dont know I could barely follow the film. But it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it. Even so they went too far for normal.<br /><br />Attack of the Sabretooth is a very poor film. Even for a low-budget sci-fi flick it is a very poor and cheap example. It will bore most viewers to tears might be attractive for some and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through. And keep in mind this is not a comedy this is a cheap horror flick so its not suppose to be comical.',neg
'Small SPOILERS alert !!!<br /><br />Good movie...VERY good movie. And Im surprised to say that myself because Im not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the directors name Deran Serafian usually means bad news. Most of his films are below average action movies like Death Warrant and Gunmen. This was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action. This movie really fascinated me. Good accomplishment seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved. It really is the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the original Dracula myth will be satisfied. Sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous Bram Stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth. It explains the life of the Roemenian Count Dracula and how he scared the Turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle. Of course thats where the reality and the based on a true story stops. The blood drinking and stuff all was invented by Bram Stoker.<br /><br />In this movie the count ( Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the USA and seduces tons of woman. And theyre all pretty girls Ill give him that. Overall good acting by unknown faces enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline. This film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore. But it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the VCR. Heck its a lot better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie with the same title. These two films have nothing else in common but I blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture. Check it out...my humble opinion on To Die For = 8.5/10',pos

If you do buy this youre really in for a disappointment do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague.

'Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded KOMODO VS. COBRA. No guesswork here. A giant CGI komodo dragon -- it sort of looks like a dog minus fur -- takes on a humongous CGI king cobra with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between. The tree huggers get charter boat captain Michael Pare (who else?) to take them to an off-limits federal island. An experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very large critters thank so to our nutty military. Now all thats left on the island are the very large critters and the mad scientists tiny shapely daughter. The group runs into her at the old plantation lab the monsters arrive and the chase is on. If you watch enough Wynorski/Sci-Fi Channel flicks youll recognize some of the sets and locations from many other movies. Acting is nonexistent as is the plot. At the very least you can enjoy watching the badly animated compo/dog stomp down on its intended victims just before scarfing them up. The cobra just strikes and swallows. No imagination at all.',neg

'Honestly I was disappointed in Expiration Date. Super clever title and interesting premise but I dont think it delivered. What was it about? The main characters desire to reconnect with his Native roots? Or more likely it was his need to overcome his fear of death. But he wasnt set up as someone who has lived his life in fear -- it seems as if his life was going fine but since doomsday is approaching he should now start worrying. I didnt buy it. Meanwhile the supporting characters in the film didnt seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story. They were all just doing their thing running parallel to the main character. Also what was treated as a curse looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally why didnt he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday? Those are my criticisms but I did love the shots of Seattle cinematography was beautiful acting was good in the times it wasnt outstanding.',neg
'Hard to describe this one -- if you were a fan of Russ Meyer films back in the day you will surely be pleased to see that Haji is still looking really hot though Forry Ackerman has not fared so well (what is he doing still making these movies anyway? If I go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie?). It was a pretty fun premise -- a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon -- but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length and the jokes were on a level with your average Joe E. Brown comedy (or Abbott and Costello if thats your thing) -- basically just bad puns. Still I found this movie fascinating to watch and for more than 2 reasons. Good job but still a fundamentally flimsy production.',neg
'**Maybe spoilers** **hard to spoil this thing more then it is but just in case** Gees I dont see how anybody could have liked this re-make!! It was like a made for T.V show and still pretty lame for that. Lots of fake snow bad acting by top stars bad action and that crazy pine forest in Detroit. What the heck??!! I didnt really think this would be a great movie but I was hoping to be entertained. Nope we fell asleep half way and had to finish it up the next day. I could have skipped the rest easy(but then I would have missed those great piney woods!) Im so glad I missed this at the theater! Bad enough to have wasted $3.50 at the video store. And I am a lover of cop action and drama films. This was a very stinky 1 out of 10 stars. Give me the original any day!!',neg
'A young and seemingly promising college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young girl and is put on death row. Sean Connery plays the happy go lucky attorney whom the young mans grandmother tracks down out of retirement and pleads with to take on the case in the hopes of freeing her grandson. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is hell bent on debunking an theory that Connery might dig up to try and free the boy whom he and the entire police department swear is guilty of the crime.

'I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson thinking they were buddy cops. They are but Busey is in the opening scene then doesnt show up again until like 40 minutes into the movie. Though every scene hes in is awesome. Especially when he disguises himself as a blind hobo.<br /><br />Whats incredible about this movie is the plot. In the movie Fred Williamson is trying to find out who stalking and killing phone sex operators. At one point I think thats its Busey. But it turns out Im only partly right. Busey is not the killer but he is calling up and harassing the women over the phone. Why? I dont know. In no way is he connected to the killer he just does it for kicks I guess.',neg
'John Cassavetes 1977 film Opening Night is what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist overlooked. It is an excellent film in its own right and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film. Its not a perfect film in that at two hours and twenty four minutes its about a half hour too long and theres a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character Myrtle Gordon played by Gena Rowlands the wife of Cassavetes long after weve gotten the point. But only Woody Allens masterpiece Another Woman which also starred Rowlands eleven years later is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman. Yet Rowlands did win the Best Actress Award at the Berlin Film Festival for this portrayal and it was well deserved. Often this film written by Cassavetes is easily compared to his earlier- and inferior- film A Woman Under The Influence but its a spurious comparison. Rowlands character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start as well as coming from a blue collar background while her characters in this film and in Allens film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions. In this film its the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as Myrtles younger doppelganger while in Allens film its her characters own past. Many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic seeing Myrtle surround herself with enablers such as a stage manager who tells her during opening night Ive seen a lot of drunks in my time but Ive never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up. Youre great! but this is wrong for alcohol isnt her problem- nor is her chain smoking. They are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction and much to Cassavetes credit as a storyteller he never lets us find out exactly whats wrong with Myrtle and despite her coming through in the end theres no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence. This sort of end without resolution links Cassavetes directly with the more daring European directors of the recent past who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience and forcing their viewers to cogitate even if it hurts.<br /><br />Yet the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama. Whether or not Myrtle Gordon does recover after the films universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide and as we have seen before that lid closes ones choices do matter.',pos

She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects.<br /><br />Second the score by then known composer Christopher(Chris) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star...yeah I know one star more is not much but in this movies case it is a lot.<br /><br />The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer blah blah blah...we all know where this is going.<br /><br />Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga then turn it off.',neg
'After I saw La Pianiste several years ago I said to myself that I would never see it again so powerful and disturbing it was. Time went on but I could not get the movie and its main character Erika Kahut out of my mind. The story of a respected Piano teacher in Vienna Conservatory cool and collected on the surface an expert in classical music with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear self-loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing. I read the book The Piano Teacher by Elfriede Jelinek the controversial Nobel Prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it I saw the film again. Second time all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as Le Pianiste. Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schuberts Piano music soaked in the morbid humanity is another bright star of the movie.<br /><br />I only have one problem with Hanekes vision. There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes to Erikas character comparing to the novel. In the book the furthest she went to reveal herself to Walter the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that she had stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book would never chase Walter to throw herself to him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to act she was not a chaser - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course Huppert was heartbreaking) but it took the mystery that surrounded her - Jelinek did not write that scene it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film.',pos
'This is truly one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger who stars as the ornery grandfather Charlie is in full overacting mode hoping that the more flashy he is the better his performance (Cue buzzer sound). Rod Steiger is one of the last true film legends and to see him in this film (although End of Days is the 2nd worst film Ive ever seen) is really heartbreaking. From the bad storyline to the nonexistent direction it becomes abudantly clear that the only reason this film was made was that the producers last name ended in DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this film is that it is so bad its truly hysterical. Look for the flashback scene where Rod wheres a Jor-El wig from Superman and a big black porno mustache. One only hopes that his follow up film I Believe in America from Uber-producer Kevin Arbouet will redeem him and leave a good taste in everyones mouths.',neg

'Great party movie following the adventures of Bill & Tom two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight-laced while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. When Bill moves out of his mothers house to live on his own he faces many issues from his girlfriend to his brother to his landlord. Meanwhile his friend Tom moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn Bills life upside down. This movie is non-stop comedy from start to finish and is a personal favorite of mine. Soundtrack features guitar virtioso Edward Van Halen throughout the movie also features cameos by rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. 70s Pornstar legend Kitten Navidad also makes an appearance! Classic 80s movie is worth multiple looks. Now all that needs to be done is a much anticipated DVD release! If you enjoyed this movie take a look at The Last American Virgin which is similar to Wild Life. I rate both highly.',pos
'Jesus Franco is pretty hit or miss on his films & Id say this was a miss that is unless youre into total sleaze. I will say that the man has an eye for a good shot even if it involves topless women with machine guns silhouetted against the ocean. This is overall pretty ridiculous and the acting is horrible but the acting is the least of what this is about. And what is it about? Well its about 102 minutes of lesbianism women picking and shoveling in the hot sun for no apparent reason and just about as much sleaze as you can stand and maybe then some. Most notable (?) is a scene involving one young woman who is tied to a chair and an apparently amorous German Shepherd and while whats going on is merely implied (thankfully) it is probably a scenario that I could have done without. Id rank this up there with Tender Flesh as one of the Franco films Id rather not have in my collection although the music is jazzy and fun. 4 out of 10 yecch.',neg
'I saw this on sale - NEW - at my local store for $6 and said hey! an action film with that guy from Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon directed by the guy who did Enter the Dragon - and its cheap! So I bought it. Oops! This is possibly the worst film Ive ever seen and Ive seen some doozies.<br /><br />You know how movies which are intentionally campy like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive are AWESOME? You know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again like Lionheart (an old Van Damme film) or John Carpenters Vampires are pretty cool? This film Ironheart manages to be NEITHER of those. I dont know what the filmmakers were thinking but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot no budget for anything and no script to speak of. (While Im on the script note I should point out that Bolo Yeung has NO LINES in this movie - the only reason he gets first billing on the box is the fact that hes the only actor in the film that youll ever recognize (unless youre a Jackie Chan fan in which case youll recognize the bad guy - and youll want to call him Giancarlo!).)<br /><br />Whats also sad is that this film is from 92. By that time T2: Judgment day had come out so you know that the era of 80s campiness was over... but not quite. After this youll think 80s Chuck Norris films high-school comedies and Jason/Freddy sequels were works of sheer genius. <br /><br />Things to know:<br /><br />1) Nobody in this film can act for beans. The closest you get is Richard Norton looking appropriately rich and cocky and Bolo Yeung looking appropriately mean ... and cocky. Everything else is dreadful.<br /><br />2) The martial arts scenes are forgettable - just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking off their shirts yelling running at Britton Lee getting kicked by Britton Lee getting punched by Britton Lee then falling down. Even the final showdown against Bolo is disappointingly short and about as creative as the design of my running socks (and equally stinky).<br /><br />3) The rest of the action is pathetic too: the guns look like they came from the toy department at K-Mart and indeed they fire with the sound of a capgun. When someone gets shot they bounce around a little bit then lie still with splotches of brownish-red liquid on their clothes. Britton Lee apparently gets shot in the side but you dont see it at all then later that day you see the wound ... Ive had paper cuts that were worse than that!<br /><br />4) Of course then the girl dresses the wound then they kiss then next thing you know theyre lying in bed talking after sex. Huh? What? Believable development of the love interest as well as any kind of character development at all are overlooked completely in this film. Remember how Bruce Lees characters didnt need to have sex with anybody to be cool?<br /><br />5) The car chase is by far the worst Ive ever seen. It looks like the director was sitting on the curb with a hand-held camera as the two cars weaved down the road doing oh I dont know about 30 miles an hour? Dont try this at home kids these people are professionals! Hah!<br /><br />6) Really bad writing. Heres a scene for you: Lee is being followed so the girl follows the followers to warn Lee but her car is too slow. So by the time she catches up Lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and theres a gunfight in progress. Lee has killed two bad guys but the third is shooting at Lee when the girl almost runs Lee over so the bad guy runs away. (Huh?) Then the girls car stalls and she cant start it. She tells Lee shes involved now and shes coming with him. He points out to her that they cant leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her. She somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem - so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car. (And remember later that same night they have sex.) Huh?!?<br /><br />7) If you look closely in more than half of the nightclub shots the dancers are very much out of sync with the music. The dancers are also all way too co-ordinated with each other (apparently in the 80s all people at dance clubs took dancing lessons). There is a girl in the DJ booth with a microphone but she never does anything except dance. The bouncers tell people who are fighting to take it outside - without moving their lips. In one scene the only bouncers Lee and Stevo pass by are just inside the entrance but with their backs to it! Also apparently if youre a major character in the film you can go straight to the head of the line.<br /><br />8) Lee notices the first time he is being followed but he doesnt notice the second time - even though its the same guy in the same car. The girl however notices. Bad guys get followed twice but they never notice.<br /><br />9) Lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girls car back to her even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice. The girl proceeds to leave her child at work in the care of a friend while she is off having sex with Lee. DO NOT learn parenting from this film!<br /><br />Cant think of more gripes right now ... you get the idea ... Ironheart is so bad it aint even funny its SAD.',neg
'I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasnt terribly motivating and didnt even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one. In fact there was almost zero technical information at all. I didnt expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video but when that info was near zero then the film just wasnt balanced and wasnt particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run.<br /><br />There were other problems. Some of the very first images were people collapsing near death while trying to run a race. Yeah real inspiring. The timing was also hard to follow because it was semi chronological but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at. And they withheld information. You see that Kantor has an injury and you just assume its from all her training but then several scenes later they finally clue you in that its because she tripped over a pine cone in her yard.<br /><br />Some parts were very good though like the bit about a woman defying race officials who wanted the run to be men-only and the coverage of a Chicago race where two of the runners portrayed earlier were vying for first place.<br /><br />Off the top of my head Im thinking of other chronological documentaries like Supersize Me and Grass where you always know where you are and you feel like they told you everything you wanted to know.<br /><br />In short it wouldnt have been hard to make a better marathon film and as it stands I cant recommend this to non-marathoners to educate and motivate them to try one because I dont think it will have that effect.',neg
'After having watched Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it I finally had a chance to see its sequel Life In Transformation. I was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie. The Philip Glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first. Compared with Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless. A watered down version of Baraka which is the same idea but done better. I truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste.',neg
'This is the most human and humane of movies that I have seen in a long time. The ironies abound Susan Sarandon as a nun Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a movie that doesnt preach but neither does it condemn. It is cinema verite at its best and yet the story is fictionalized from several real events.<br /><br />Which of the two is more amazing Sarandon or Penn? It is easy to say who is more likeable but it is hard to say who is more convincing. they are simply magnificent.<br /><br />You may think that all killers should be killed or you may argue that life without parole is no life and that death is more merciful. whatever your personal feeling this movie gives you a chance to pause and reconsider.<br /><br />At the end one simply wants to sit in silence and reflect. That is what great drama does it gives catharsis it creates a moment in time a shared memory that touches our humanity.',pos
'This review comes nearly 30 years late. Nevertheless it has to be mentioned that I chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight! I just had to write about it! I got smitten and forgot anything else existed once I saw this movie. How ironic it is to see Literatures ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handsomest man! yet what a welcome irony! It suited me perfectly and more so because Timothy Dalton did full justice to his role. He delivered an astounding and triumphant performance! I have never seen anything like it! All the other actors are very good too. The whole movie was put together beautifully. I dont care what anyone says about this movie. I just love it and love it! It made me happy and satisfied. It crushes me a bit to say this but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to A&Es P&J which I believe is the ultimate mini-series. <br /><br />The excerpts from Jane Eyre spooked me a little back in school. I never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well. Seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy. The scenes and Mr. Daltons voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously which of course is a masterpiece. Bravo to the whole team and especially to Mr.Dalton!! This movie is now a part of me.<br /><br />I give it 10/10 rating.',pos
'Im rarely moved to make a comment online about a film. But I cant understand how this one got made. Who made it? How could they have possibly thought they were capable of making a feature film? Did they do a weekend course at some film school get a nice big cheque from daddy and kidnap David Badiels family one by one until he agreed to be in it? Or was he by any chance a longtime family friend/distant relation doing this out of sheer misplaced kindness? I dont care dont want to know. Even he looks utterly embarrassed to be in it mumbling his lines and hiding his face from the camera. Meanwhile the DOP must have been the gaffer from Neighbours there seemed to be absolutely no sound design the script the direction and editing were all abysmal and quite frankly the apathy that overwhelms me right now means that I cant be bothered to spend any more of my life thinking about this film.',neg

A spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it. This movie does not have any such aspect.<br /><br />Save yourself. Its too late for me but... just dont watch it.',neg
'Sharpes Honour for the uninitiated is the fifth entry in a series of TV movies focusing on an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and based on the books by Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading). If you were to start by watching this particular one though youd get the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force which the rest of the army revolves around. Should that be the case Id recommend starting with earlier chapters like Sharpes Eagle or Sharpes Company but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing.<br /><br />The story this time is all about the espionage side of things. With the French army retreating in disarray from Spain Major Ducos the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round. By pinning the murder of a Spanish Marques on Richard Sharpe hero of the British army the fragile British/Spanish alliance will start to crumble and things will turn around again. When the Spanish nobles come to Wellington crying for Sharpes blood though the English general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his death and soon hes off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot. Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe film as well theres a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the way fancy that.<br /><br />What this results in of course is a more adventure style approach. The concentration is less on the workings of the English military with Sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside dodging French patrols hob nobbing with the Spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper his loyal right hand man accompanies him naturally but the rest of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive. Strangely enough though they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of Harpers baby.<br /><br />This slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode but is only a good thing in the long run. And should anyone be worried that there wont be the standard battle at the climax fret not because once again the poor old French get a right kicking. Furthermore Ducos makes a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a duplicitous malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere Hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man youd want to deliver your first born even if he does look like a member of Iron Maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.<br /><br />In short then another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. Its not the best introduction if youve not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to Sharpe that we dont normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if thats not enough to get you tempted its also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged Sean Bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns.',pos
'No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series of which only 3 have been on so far is awful. The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. As a BBC licence payer after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment. Im amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didnt object to the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons surly they can see its lost all direction. Its a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley West Yorkshire England.',neg
'This was a disgrace to the game FarCry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare. Besides the bad acting the visual effects stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop. The movie is not worth watching at all. The funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss Jack in order to give him the key to the cuffs. Guess the she got the keys to handcuffs all the time. I hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday. And I they will invest some good cash to get the visual effects right and the scenaries right as well as the ACTING right.

This garbage is a prime example of what kind of lame random uninspired last minute generic plot twists have become the norm since movies like The Sixth Sense and The Others were released. This was an okay movie until the writers took a dump all over whatever of the mediocre script they had written and decided Hey heres an interesting idea: Lets throw in a wacky twist at the end and make the main character the murderer!

'Im only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile. I love to praise a great movie and Im not biased toward male movies. Legally blonde was an excellent film. Georgia Rule on the other hand was a disorganized weak poorly written unrealistic example of movie making at its worst. by the end of the film I didnt care who was lying or if anything was resolved. <br /><br />The most important thing in a film is a good STORY. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject matter is deep doesnt mean the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change and is primed for that change over the course of the movie. In Georgia Rule the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time (youve only got a couple hours in a movie). That means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the poorly written story and the litter of weak dynamic characters I cant even say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. Thats fine if yourre writing American Beauty but not when youre attempting a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (no Im not cutting her any slack because she was molested crap happens to everyone and were all responsible for our own actions). The Dudley Do Right Mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments...and Simon I mean seriously what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl whos been molested just stay over occasionally (unless hes an actor or a politician). This movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself what good movie making is NOT!',neg
'I watched this one mostly to see Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel two of my favorites.<br /><br />The plot has many a twist and turn -- its not bad as a straight mystery aboard a train.<br /><br />But why throw in a circus train wreck and an escaped gorilla? I can mention this without it being a spoiler because the circus train wreck and the gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate mystery plot.<br /><br />The bad person trying to kill the good people has many tricks up his sleeve but the circus train wreck was purely coincidental.

'This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I have ever seen! I am giving this movie way too much credit! My best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone elses martial arts abilities but realized that you cant just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it so he put a story behind the fighting... and people still didnt watch it.<br /><br />This movies story line was onion skin thin. That acting was goofy and stereotypical of any Kung Fu movie. The dubbing was literally the worst I have ever heard. It seemed if you played a small role in this movie like the fat guy or the two guys trying to catch the main character with a net it didnt matter who over did your voice. It could have been a dyslexic with a slurred stutter and nobody would have said anything. But beside all of this the movie makes up for itself with the somewhat awesome fight scenes.<br /><br />The fight scenes were definitely what this movie was all about. But the instigations of the fights were totally absurd! On most all instances a guy either pops out of the tall grass or glances at the main character from a distance and then attacks him. But once the fighting started things sort of balanced out. There were only two things that really hampered the fighting though. Those constant wooshing sound effects that were added to every swing of a fist or foot or sword and the poor editing that made 25 percent of the fighting VERY jumpy and choppy. Someone would be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly be on the ground being kicked and then instantly be back on their feet blocking a punch. But while the cut and paste editing was more of a nuisance than anything else it didnt really affect the overall movie.<br /><br />In the end this was not a great movie but I wasnt expecting a great movie. A great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movies. All I saw this movie as was a way to pass an hour and a half of boredom. I rarely say that but this was just one of those movies you have no practical use for so you watch it whenever you have some free time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Good day gentlemen.<br /><br />-Scott-',neg
'Before Id seen this movie Ive heard a lot of praise about it and quite many exclamations about how horrific it was. Not to take any credit away from this movie I think it wasnt all that horrible or even shocking. Its just a movie about people living in the darker side of the town. And a good one at portraying the point.<br /><br />Theres some great acting here and a well-thought of manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a renowned writer in the Finnish movie scene and hes the best in what comes to describing the contemporary Finnish culture (albeit hes not the only one writer for this movie but I dare say hes the main-writer anyway. Correct me if Im wrong).<br /><br />The casting is excellent except for Jasper Pääkkönen (the pseudo-main character who in my opinion should have stayed in the soap opera scene) and the sets the cuts and sounds are very well done as well and give great atmosphere to this movie.<br /><br />This movie is a story about loosely interconnected sad destinies that according to a famous Finnish bands very well known song (Eppu Normaalis Tuhansien Murheellisten Laulujen Maa which VERY roughly translated to Paha Maa) throughout the whole Finnish society lead to a sad dark end accompanied with booze lonesomeness and the bad choices. And its the side of everyday Finnish life about 80\% of the population have no awareness of unless movies like this are made.',pos
'I do not envy Barry Levinson Rachel Weisz Ben Stiller or Jack Black for doing this film. Its in one word boring. Maybe the fact that is too predictable the more-than-exploited Ben Stillers loser role or the not-at-all funny scenes make this film just something to forget. Even Christopher Walkens appearance finishes in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stillers acting. I loved it in most of his films the last one I saw before this was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and was not that bad. About Jack Black... Well apart from High Fidelity Ive never seen him doing something good. What about School of Rock? Ooops frightening.',neg
'I liked Antz but loved A Bugs Life. The animation that was put into this paid off. I will definitely be getting this on DVD. By the way Disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape. (I heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format). Most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest! I only saw one of the two sets but I cant wat to see the other one!',pos
'Where to Begin I like the scary snow-monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me we thought hed be back and he was. Changing the local to a tropical resort works. Seeing old friends and meeting new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job as Jack Frost you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance. Yup Jack Frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first. I do have one complaint the little Jacks or the Jacklings as I call them. They looked like hand puppets. I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings the mouth could have opened wider but the CGI was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again. If you liked JACK FROST then you will like this sequel. No questions or debate 9 BIG STARS.',pos
'After watching many of the Next Action Star reality TV eps TiVo taped this gawd-awful tripe for me. For some bizarre reason - and I only have myself to blame - I watched the whole thing hoping that there would be *something* unique in the entire movie. After so much hype about Joel Silvers Midas Touch with action flicks he might want to make sure he bones up on his alchemy.<br /><br />First the only redeeming value of the entire film was Billy Zane and even he couldnt lift the slipshod writing out of the crapper. Having said that Zanes performance falters about 2/ 3rds of the way through as he doesnt even seem to know what else to do other than look smug. <br /><br />Cant blame him here though. The writing quite frankly sucked. Lets take ideas from Rat Race Enemy of the State Terminator Midnight Run and any bad gambling film you can think of and simply rehash it. And whos brilliant idea was it to have TWO bridge chase sequences in a ROW?<br /><br />Sean Carrigan the man of the hour of The Next Action Star shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series. A one-note johnny Sean plays the dumb good looking jock very well but struggles with shouldering the weight of the film. Quite frankly we never quite seem to care about whether he lives or dies by about mid-way through as Carrigan fails to provide a reason for the audience to even like him. His dumb-but-lucky routine gets old as there really isnt anything about the character to root for.<br /><br />But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Did Howard Fine really tell her to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the film? I dont think so. I kept expecting her to quote Arnie. Her character performance can be compared only to the dramatic depths of Freddy Got Fingered though not nearly as well-developed. The camera loves her in dark shadowy limousines but in the harsh light of day her demeanor sucks all energy off the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than Corinne showed at any part of her screen time.<br /><br />Ultimately Sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast but shouldnt have been left to do this one solo. It was simply too big of a task for him. Next Action Star colleague Jared Elliot may or may not have had better luck with some more dynamic characterization but its hard to tell given Jeff Welchs lame script. Someone should take Welchs iMac away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else. And finally Van Ryck de Groot simply was outclassed and way out of her reach even for complete shlock like this. <br /><br />Joel Silver should be ashamed.',neg
'Honest to God the Outline pretty much says it all. The planet Andromina (not to be confused with Aunt Jemima) is represented by a cheap L.A. stripclub. Theres no strippers so the most recent male visitors go off to recruit strippers.<br /><br />The men get mistaken for kings or arrested for spying on women (although despite the fact its a planet of women we only get two women who participate in any girl-girl sex scenes) and eventually as always happen in science fiction cliche movies everywhere the women become convinced that men are good for something. Well not the men who made this movie at any rate!<br /><br />But boy do we get to see a lot of that something in prodigious amounts of softcore sex and nudity. This one has less plot then usual for such flicks so change the channel if you dont like this kind of movie and grit your teeth if youre into this kind of thing.',neg

But if you watch the other Rainbow Brite movies this one is by far the best. But like I said its a kids movie. You have to judge it as a kids movie. It doesnt matter to kids if the acting animation or script is fantastic or even good. All they care about is what happens to the characters. If the good guy (or girl) wins then its a great movie. If not then its bad. You all know what I mean. You were all kids once.',pos
'I was one of the few non-liberals who showed up to see Steves video. It was quite an experience... in propaganda film-making and boredom.<br /><br />I was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of Michael Moores visit to my local school UVSC but it turned out to be another liberal slash-and-burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community. It sure seems self-serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues.<br /><br />Whats more surprising is to see all the 10 votes his homeys have posted here. Did they even see the video? Golly gee Batman this must rank with All The Presidents Men! Their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film. <br /><br />Yeah like stacking the votes at IMDb will help a lame movie. Maybe my vote will help balance this out.',neg
'I am not a big fan of horror films and have only seen a handful of them (and none of the Halloweens or Friday the Thirteenths) - but I can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore. And Im pretty sure this isnt scary.<br /><br /> Whats so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots so theres no real surprise in any of this film. (Not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway but . . .)<br /><br /> The plot concerns Claus Von Bulows third cousin (John Hudson) who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husbands mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH!!!! Wonder who did it!!!!<br /><br /> This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. If you want to see a well-done version of this stuff try Reversal of Fortune. And BTW Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson.<br /><br /> The MSTing was okay but nothing special; paired with the Gumby short however it makes for good viewing.<br /><br /> Two stars for The Screaming Skull; eight stars for the MST3K version.<br /><br /> And now to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself: How bad is this film? You have no idea!',neg
'I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it. Its beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time. Its difficult to believe this was made in 1946 as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think. Im not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made. In addition the acting is superb and the use of English and American actors quite astounding. I recently purchased the DVD so now Im able to watch whenever I wish. I highly recommend anyone interested in post-war British films to watch this.',pos
'Disney has now made straight-to-video sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features. Two of these were made for their 1991 classic Beauty and the Beast. Well these ones arent really sequels as they are both set in between the events of the first film. The first of these two straight-to-video films was Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor but I think that can usually be expected with sequels. However this second one Belles Magical World is definitely inferior.<br /><br />The film features three short stories all of which take place while Belle is in the castle and the place is under the spell of the enchantress. The first is The Perfect Word where a misunderstanding at the table between Belle and the Beast leads to trouble and neither wants to be the first to apologize. The next story is Fifis Folly where Fifi and Lumieres fifth anniversary is coming up and Lumiere is unprepared so Belle helps him. However Fifi sees Lumiere practicing romance with Belle and thinks theyre actually in love. The film ends with The Broken Wing. In this story Belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the Beast finds out as he hates birds! <br /><br />The plot description I gave is for the original VHS version of Disneys third Beauty and the Beast movie. Apparently in the DVD version there is another story added called Mrs. Pottss Party but Ive only seen the original version. However since I highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest I see no point in watching the special edition. Anyway the first thing I will say about Belles Magical World is that the animation is very 2-dimensional compared to what were used to from Disney which would obviously disappoint many people. I didnt like Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas that much but you certainly cant say the same about its animation. Im sure the stories in Belles Magical World could entertain many kids (mostly younger ones I think) and each story has a moral so they could also teach them some valuable lessons. However for adults the film really doesnt have a lot. I personally didnt find any good humour in it found that the constant conflict between Belle and the Beast got tiring and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way (theyre not very well written). In The Perfect Word the way Belle says to the Beast Youre acting rude... and foolish! is a bit cheesy and I think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories.<br /><br />By the time this straight-to-video movie first came out I was around eleven or twelve years old. I dont know what I would have thought of it at the time as I had lost interest in Disney by then and it would be years before I would gain any of that interest back. Even when this movie was first released I think I was a bit past the age group it was aimed at. I never saw Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas until a couple months ago but unlike that film I never even heard of this one until recently I think just after seeing the first sequel to Disneys 1991 hit. Well as much as I like the theatrical original I wouldnt have been missing much if I never became aware of this films existence. For little kids Im sure Belles Magical World can be highly entertaining and probably somewhat educational with its morals but I do not recommend it for adult Disney fans.',neg
'Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball especially her autobiography. Ive never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages. In all I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi Jr. I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.',neg
'Some movies you watch and you say Well that made no sense. And you dont really mean it. Youre just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical.<br /><br />Bread And Circus makes no sense at all. And I mean it. And thats not because its surreal. From the start its pretty clear its a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects. Theres no script. Theres no plot. Theres no story of any kind. One event does not lead to the next -- thats how fundamental the bad writing is here.<br /><br />So what? I mean there are TONS of movies out there that fall into that category. They want to show you gore they give you gore. Why even talk about it?<br /><br />Because in this case Bread and Circus gave me hope. Okay there are some surreal elements. Vaginas in the ground -- people crawling out of them. The earth in space two legs on either side. These sorts of images are wonderful fun odd crazy. But the movie doesnt do anything with them.<br /><br />Stuff happens the movie ends and its all very unsatisfying. I suspect the script was made up on the fly. Too bad. If there had been a story of ANY kind at all it would have made for a much more entertaining film.<br /><br />The film is very much like the beautiful car you would love to own. Then you lift up the hood and theres no engine. Just a small man peddling a bicycle.<br /><br />GRR!',neg

'As a Christian I found this movie to be completely embarrassing. The actors sucked the writing sucked the cinematography sucked and the story was so typical. I couldnt say this is a great witnessing tool because Id be too embarrassed to show any of my unsaved friends. Hollywood has much better stuff and thats because they invest the best into it. Christians put out sh*tty work and think its OK because its for the lord. In the old testament people spent huge amounts of money to bring offerings to God. David (or Saul.. I dont remember) spent what would be equal to about $50 Billion in todays money on building a temple for God. But these days spending what would appear to be about $30000 tops on making a movie to witness to people with is just pathetic. Its the person not the product that affects someone. Dont waste your time trying to convert your friends with this waste of an hour and a half. If you want to make a positive impact with people show them movies like The Matrix American Beauty Braveheart etc.. movies that have something to say and actually get it into you.',neg

'Less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH should not be really be compared with such Hitchcock masterpieces as VERTIGO REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO; it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Shot largely on location in Morocco and London the film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot--and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence.<br /><br />James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their roles of the All-American couple and the characters are given an unusual twist: Stewart a midwestern doctor is outgoing but has a touch of the ugly American abroad about his personality; Day who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage has a suspicious nature. These qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story.<br /><br />THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH contains a number of famous scenes; both the scene in which Stewart drugs Day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex Albert Hall sequence involving what seems hundreds of cuts are very powerful. Less often noticed although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory are the more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor as when Stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and Day belts out Que Sera Sera (written for this film) in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party.<br /><br />Although THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH lacks the depth and impact of Hitchcocks greater work it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole. Its Hitchcock-light but recommended.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer',pos
'As a child growing up in the Sydney of the 1950s I can readily identify with the content of this fine film.

Youve read the plot so all I want to say is dont watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble because thats the typical misconception people read in toinstead just appreciate and realise its about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it. This was one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and foreign. The beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used to the Hollywood formula just a great story that will keep you engaged.

'Extraordinary Rendition is a frightening practice authorized surprisingly under Clinton that allows the U.S. government to seize and hold anyone suspected seemingly for any reason of being a terrorist against the United States. This is a touchy issue especially after 9/11 because supporters of the practice will always criticize the opposition as withholding vital power from the U.S. that it needs to effectively fight terror. Fanatic supporters will label the opposition as terrorists in themselves. <br /><br />But like a recent film that lent a similar level of humanity to the death penalty The Life of David Gale Rendition shows us a story of the misuse of extraordinary rendition or at least the ease with which it can be exploited and falsely applied. The story involves Anwar El- Abrahimi an American chemical engineer born in Egypt who is seized on his way back to America from giving a lecture in Egypt. The cause given is that he made phone calls to a known terrorist. No proof is ever given (or needed) that it was Anwar that made the calls that his phone was never lost of stolen. <br /><br />Meanwhile Anwars extremely pregnant wife Isabella is back in the states frantically trying to find her husband who got onto a plane to Chicago but apparently never got off. The flimsy explanation that he was never there evaporates when she discovers that he made an in-flight purchase using his credit card. <br /><br />Lately I have been researching modern Chinese history particularly that of the astonishingly selfish and brutal dictatorship set up by Mao Tse-tung and it is more than a little frightening to see the similarities between extraordinary rendition and some of Maos brutal scare tactics including his public executions (which the people were forced to watch) and extensive use of torture specifically used to extract confessions. <br /><br />It is pretty disturbing to notice that Mao specifically did these things to create an environment of fear in order to achieve obedience from the Chinese people. To say that the Bush administration has not created an environment of fear and continues to milk it for everything its worth would be naïve in the extreme and although extraordinary rendition was not created under Bush it is clear that it does more harm than good.<br /><br />Adding to the thickness of the film is Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) who works behind a desk for the CIA and has little field experience until his boss is assassinated and he suddenly finds himself supervising the torture of a man that he quickly comes to doubt has anything to reveal. Fatimas (Freemans boss) daughter also plays a pivotal role as does a senatorial aide played by Peter Sarsgaard who might have the most satisfying role in the movie. Meryl Streep is also suitably cold and clinical as a chilly senator with a dogmatic support of the necessity and practice of rendition. <br /><br />As a political thriller the movie is remarkably well-crafted and paced. But the scariest thing about it is that this is all real. The movies goal is to get people to really think about the things done in Americas name especially when they claim to be done to prevent those same things. Conducting terror in the name of preventing terror will win no sympathy for us nor will extracting confessions through brutal torture which is the basest form of criminal investigation. <br /><br />Unfortunately we are gradually heading in that direction of doing these things more rather than less. The frightening question is what is the event that is going to take place at some point in the future to convince us to stop and head the other way toward civilization and peace or will we just keep heading toward a military dictatorship until we finally get there?',pos
'When I first saw a small scene of it in some announcements I thought the show would be entertaining to watch. The little robot guy does look kinda cute. The style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows. Before the show aired I studied it through some sources. There I did became slightly dismayed. The three children (Tommy Gus and Lola) are voiced appropriately but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad. One good example is Robot Jones a robot character from Whatever Happened To Robot Jones? The show isnt bad really. But the way Robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism. Thus I dont watch it much.',neg
'Brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies.

There may have been a deep meaning behind it but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys.<br /><br />I would highly recommend his other works to people but certainly not this one. As I watched it I kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period but it never did. At the end of the movie I was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way. I could only say to myself What was that?<br /><br />There were a few really striking parts of the film but not enough to warrant sitting through it again.',neg
'Excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair. Then again the point of the film to paraphrase another comment is that every relationship can be unique and intimate. A truly quality short film which caught me at my busiest yet had the power to pull me down onto the sofa and watch fixed and quiet for the duration. Bobby and Tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a cathartic exercise. Beyond that the film within a film idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting though in a somewhat melancholic way.',pos
'Naturally in a film whos main themes are of mortality nostalgia and loss of innocence it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more highly by older viewers than younger ones. However there is a craftsmanship and completeness to the film which anyone can enjoy. The pace is steady and constant the characters full and engaging the relationships and interactions natural showing that you do not need floods of tears to show emotion screams to show fear shouting to show dispute or violence to show anger. Naturally Joyces short story lends the film a ready made structure as perfect as a polished diamond but the small changes Huston makes such as the inclusion of the poem fit in neatly. It is truly a masterpiece of tact subtlety and overwhelming beauty.',pos
'Saw this on cable back in the early 90s and loved it. Never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently. Still find it a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why its not higher rated. I found everything about this film compelling. As a vet (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations brought by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in Iraq. I wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see. The human toll on our soldiers isnt left on the battlefield. Its brought home for the rest of there lives. And this film is one of many that brings that home in a very hard way. Excellent film.',pos
'There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat OBrien). OBrien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. Hes tough when he has to be yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. OBrien seems natural in the role and plays it in fine fashion. Two things help this movie: OBriens performance and the spectacular special effects ending.',neg
'From todays point of view it is quite ridiculous to rate this film 18 (or X in the US). The film has a sexual yet sublime erotic story to tell but the pictures are rather innocent.

'The Road Rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the Master to fight crime around the world. The show was hilarious to say the least. Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages. Running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game. The action was mesmerizing and cleverly set up. The characters were very original each with a very different personality. But what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters. Each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but implied in subtext. Hopefully one day therell be some way to watch the Rovers in action again.',pos
'This is a story of a long and awkward love. The daily life of a woman of 50 years old and some people around her is depicted. Her daily life is so ordinary and routine that I doubted who was the real lead character in the beginning. Then the audiences know that the woman and a man who was her high-school class mate had very tiny connection. The woman has been doing the same job - a milk-woman and a supermarket casher - so long. There are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very hard job. The man had married another woman who is now dying of cancer. He works at the City Hall and devotedly cares her at home. They never look straight nor talk each other but they never forget each other. <br /><br />The original Japanese title means At some time the days you read books. But of course when the man said Now I want to do what Ive always wanted to do it was to hug her and make love with her. She writes to a radio disk jockey that If God gives us time to talk we need at least a whole day. Dreaming of that day she has been sublimating the desire in hard work and book reading. I personally know a woman who has loved a man for long years even after he married another woman and died for an accident. Therefore the story setting is not that special. Rather this movie well portrays unspoken romances in many ordinary men and women. Through this movie you will recall your romance that is lost long ago. This is a movie with lasting effect.',pos
'Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna was a two-part star studded historical T.V. movie based on the Peter Kurth book Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. It keeps up historically pretty much names are changed etc. But sticks to the real story quite well. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom do quite well as the Russian royals Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra. What stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. All in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting. I was quite awestruck by the production values when it first aired on NBC in late 1986. Also starring was the fine German actor Jan Niklas who had previously starred in NBCs other Russian epic Peter the Great. <br /><br />I felt that Part 2 skipped over some important details of Anna Andersons trip to America. Its important to know too that in 1986 less was known about the Anna Anderson story. Back then it was still not known whether her claim to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. By the late 1990s more was known and Anna Anderson is now reputed to have been a fraud. <br /><br />Too bad the networks arent making fine made-for-television movies like this anymore.',pos
'The reason I think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion. From the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are. You understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others. You can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once. You see humanity at its best AND at its worst. You can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and downfalls in them that you see in yourself. To a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters. I will say that I have have never EVER cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something. I implore you to watch this movie and take its meaning to heart. That there is only one true thing and that is... love.',pos
'Updating of the Clare Booth Luce play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment. The cast of women is excellent most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together. There is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. Granted the story of a woman dealing with her husbands infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common but at the same time its just as timely as ever I just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really dont feel pulled along by the plot.

'America needs the best man possible to win The game so who do they hire?

Kurt Thomas is like 5 foot 4 and he hardly strikes one as The best man for the job As to the acting talent of Kurt Thomas well if you cant say something nice... In all seriousness though one has to wonder how much cocaine was being used to furnish an idea so stupid. Only the decision to cast Tara Reid as a scientist tops the dumbness here. For 18 years though this held the title of the dumbest movie I had ever seen. Not to say I didnt find this unwatchable I was laughing so hard I almost choked to death. Twice. Only in the 80s could a movie with such a bad idea get made. Although for the record it is the only movie to ever feature a hero so wimpy he cant even pull a wedged sword out from the ground. This is the wimpiest action movie ever made and one of the most hilarious also.<br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)',neg
'I got this movie because I worked at a movie store so I got free rentals. It came in and the cover made it look alright. Hot chick carrying a weapon alright Ill check it out.<br /><br />Oh man bad move. This was so horrible I spent half the movie watching in fast-forward to get to the nudity which was minimal. I think MAYBE three scenes of partial nudity.<br /><br />Cheesy dialogue crappy violence poor excuses of characters. I feel bad putting this movie down because I know it was made on a cheap budget but so was Clerks and it became a cult classic and a franchise.<br /><br />2/10.',neg
'In this film there is a loose plot of a man (Bardem) who wishes to obtain financing for his construction business and marries a woman he does not love (the wide-eyed Maria de Medieros) in the process. He maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love and ultimately gets entangled in his own romantic web. He never gives up his juggling act until the three main characters come face to face. The film results boring with lots of free sex (well both girls are really good) all the reactions in the film are absurd incoherent and of course too much stupid. None of the characters are believable which makes the movie a little annoying. Anyway the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directed film which makes it a little interesting but if you can watch another film please!',neg

'I agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries and agree that it does have its pros not only its cons. For example the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the love affair of Paul Atreides and Chani which on reading the novel is a travesty probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes. This was one of the great failings of the original film and the miniseries to its credit does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the Lynch film due to the expansive nature of the Herbert novel.<br /><br />However this in itself is a double edged sword. Rather than complete a text-to-celluloid transfer of the novel the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines absent from the original novel. Similarly although this is surely a fuller account of the storyline of Dune it is also a break from the originals heart and soul & main vision - that of prophecy. Where are the internal monologues that characterize Herberts writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues? Gone. So much of the original agony of Pauls decision to choose the jihad or death the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one which captivates people who are far from Science fiction fans) is missing. <br /><br />Without prophecy what is the point of Dune? It is simply a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad that this is all we are provided with. Lynchs film was flawed yes. But a flawed film could lead to a correction by another film-maker taking on some of the best points of Lynchs film-making and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline. Now this story shall probably never be translated to film again and this I find heartrending.',neg
'Kirstie Alley looking a bit slimmer but only a bit is in this mess along with a man who is a MacGuyver lookalike bleached blond hair and all. The premise of the movie is about an older woman (50!!!) who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer. Not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for Kirsties character and why this is included is a mystery. The actor who portrays Kirsties brother is so wooden and miscast it was torture to watch their scenes. What is there to say about this film. Avoid it.',neg
'Horrible writing directing and acting! The writer/director has portrayed Southerners especially Southern law enforcement as ignorant backwoods homophobic and racist (a very popular yet ignorant stereotype that the film industry loves to perpetuate). The acting (or overacting) and the writing came across as amateurish and low budget. The plot line is the same old stale Hollywood story of the mean ol racist and homophobic rednecks who are ultimately defeated by the enlightened people from Newwww Yoke Ceety.<br /><br />I was raised in the small Louisiana town where this movie was filmed and looked forward to seeing the film but was immediately disappointed during the first few minutes of the movie. The start of the film depicts a gay bar located in the swamps of Louisiana. How ridiculous a concept! There are a lot of gays and gay bars in south Louisiana but no gay bars in the swamps or small towns of Louisiana. We then are introduced to the sheriff who uses the phrases homuh-sexl in the worst southern drawl and overdone performance ever. Then there is the scene where the local police are watching porno on duty in the police station. I could go on and on about the horrible cheesy acting or the stale stereotypes or ridiculous scenes.<br /><br />This director and his crew were welcomed into this small friendly town and shown true southern hospitality. The townspeople of Lake Arthur and the state of Louisiana were only to be insulted and degraded in the final editing. The good people of Lake Arthur were excited and enamored with Hollywood being in town not knowing that in the end they would be portrayed as ignorant racist and homophobic country bumpkins in a low budget amateur movie that went straight to DVD. My advice: skip this one or watch it on late night Cinemax if it ever makes their rotation.',neg
'I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100\% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.<br /><br />The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.<br /><br />We will enjoy the movie again!',pos
'The basic story idea of ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent--two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To further defray costs they get two other strangers to come along. What makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life. Unfortunately this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous. Her doe-eyed expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isnt a zombie movie or shes just meant to be an idiot! And to make it worse Reginald Owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that I was very close to turning off the film--he was that awful and unbelievable. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10--which is very very difficult to understand. Sure the film has great ambiance and a good plot but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture. Sorry but this film was aching for a re-make!',neg
'This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Dammes best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence check out Undisputed 2. Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched The Shepherd I thought that Van Damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen. Van Damme holds his own though and although he isnt quite as athletic as Adkins is he can still kick with the best of them. All of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped. I think Van Dammes characters motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit. The reason he does is very cool but you dont find out until the very end. There are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a Van Damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it aint character development. Overall though this is a solid action movie that I recommend. So run for the Damme border!',pos
'I think that this is a disappointing sequel. I miss a lot of the old characters (King Gator Anne Marie etc.) and I dont like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters. A lot of personality was lost in Charlie and the villain Red is not even half as bad as Carface was in the first one. If youre a big ADGTH fan like I am its worth seeing just to see how the story is continued but dont count on it being 5 stars in your book.',neg
'This is not the true story. It is the darkest possible fiction derived from the events. It endorses suicide morose obsession with death a totally gratuitous sideswipe at organized religion in general (and the Anglican Church in particular) and generally provides a nihilistic pointless world view from which filmgoers I suppose are intended to walk away richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their hopelessness.<br /><br />Utter trash though attractively performed by a capable cast. That anyone would suggest this is a true rendering however is very much false advertising. You want the real story? Rent Fairy Tale. Thats the real story. See if you can find any correspondence between the facts presented in either case. I only found one: the girls who made the original photographs were pre-pubescent.',neg
'Are sea side resorts the sad dreary places theyre always depicted as in movies and novels? Certainly this movie along with the near-contemporary Dont Look Now depicts Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-hearted approach see Just Married with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). Having never been to Venice I cant say for sure but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from Luchino Visconti one of the great stylists of world cinema. Having seen the movie I now wish I had gotten around to reading the Thomas Mann novella its based on (which also inspired an opera by Sir Benjamin Britten). Since I dont know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or exposition Im left wondering about Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde)s obsession with young Tadzio. Is he a homosexual? A pedophile? Or is his longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent? Perhaps Tadzio reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be. Those who complain of the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung-fu: at 2 hours and 15 minutes its not particularly long and it moves at a leisurely but hardly sluggish pace. The film benefits from the ravishing music of Gustave Mahler on whom Aschenbachs character is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde gives a moving performance and the movie is graced by the presence of Silvana Mangano one of Italys great beauties as Tadzios mother.',pos
'If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected. In Memento Nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly. We were able to tell when it was the past when its current etc. However Nolan experimented with it a little and it just doesnt work. Although he had a small budget and couldnt use color (which is one way Memento worked) it was just too hard to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order. I intended to write my review after watching it so hopefully it would make more sense but of course it wasnt working.<br /><br />You cant blame Nolan for not coming up with original ideas. A young man Bill (Jeremy Theobald) is bored so he decides to follow random people on the street. He finds one Cobb (Alex Haw) that particularly interests him. Soon Bill becomes friends with Cobb and goes with him as he breaks into houses and robs them. Then a saucy young blond (Lucy Russell) enters and the movie becomes even weirder from there.<br /><br />The ending of Following is one of the most shocking endings Ive seen. Sure Fight Club had an amazing ending but the way that Followings ending played out was amazing. I felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion. Nolan has a thing for making good endings (well maybe not I could guess Insomnias from a mile away) and can really construct a great story. Following may not be the easiest to follow or look at but its such a finely crafted original story with a shocker ending that youll probably want to watch all of its 70 minutes again.<br /><br />My rating: 7/10<br /><br />Rated R for language and some violence.',pos
'Im not American but Meatballs still really hits me. Maybe because its a sweet sweet movie. Watching it again today made me sentimental for a time I cant really put my finger on and a place I cant quite remember.<br /><br />Meatballs is just a great movie. It reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possible.<br /><br />If youre reading this you probably know what I mean.<br /><br />All I can say on top of what Ive already said is that Meatballs must be even more nostalgic if youre American.<br /><br />I guess you know what I mean by that too.',pos
'A bickering American family vacationing in the west discover a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. Little do they know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs and a deadly presence is stalking them. I generally love mystery-horror films like this. Cube Spielbergs Duel and The Birds are all great examples of movies that give no answers but nonetheless leave us intrigued and wanting more. Apparently Disappearance writer/director Walter Klenhard was trying to make just that kind of film and whether or not he succeeded is up to the viewer. I personally think he got about half way there then the film just sunk.<br /><br />The actors are all kind of just ho-hum. Their not especially bad but we as an audience never really feel their fear and they react to situations in unrealistic ways. Is anyone else absolutely SICK of characters just walking out off to investigate strange sounds?!?!? At least give them SOME kind of justification for doing so!?!?!?<br /><br />As far as made-for-TV films go its an above average fair for sure. Director Klenhard Should be commended for really milking the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the setting were striking. Theres a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test ground were the sand had been completely melted to glass for as far as the eye could see. I wonder if that was real<br /><br />No gore to speak of and the creaturesor what ever the hell it is thats after these peopleare never shown not to mention that we are never even given a real clue as to what they are (Mutants aliens ghosts or ancient evil Indian spiritsOh that really narrows it down for us!) or where the come from. <br /><br />There are lots of clichés here too. Why is it that towns-folk in these kinds of films are always really really dumb? Why is there always an old guy everyone thinks is crazy that turns out to be correct? Why? Why? Why? How bout a NEW scenario folks! <br /><br />Disappearance tries to be different and intelligent but ultimately fails in that in many ways its too familiar to us fans of direct-to-video horror fodder. Hey Ive seen much worse films and disappearance aint bad its just too Average.<br /><br />4/10.',neg

The steak tartar scene is absolutely uproarious and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious...Im not sure what Fulci was trying to do but has anyone heard that based on this film Fulci accused Wes Craven of ripping him off with Scream?

'Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few antics between them. Fine. But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. It continues in this vein for a while until in the end it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter. But by now its too late. Its hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films. Difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work. And the box office proved it to be a real flop because Id never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).',neg
'This film (along with Rinne) are minor gems amongst the retread homage pics that have passed for horror movies so far at the 8FTDF HorrorFest. And yes thats faint praise indeed. Cause theres not much worse in filmdom than would-be auteurs who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot.<br /><br />And thats all you get with The Abandoned. This is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head. Sure it would have been nice if hed transfered it to film but this happened instead. Its a very pretty film with a few genuine scares but the last reel is strictly for the latte slurping cineaste crowd.',neg
'This movie was in a sci-fi 50-pack a friend of mine got me for Christmas. It is very similar to the first Gozilla movie and like that movie has scenes with American actors inserted for no real reason. One interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that theres a Cold War tension portrayed between America and Russia. Like in Godzilla Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rampages across the world paying close attention to Tokyo because no big monster movie is complete unless Tokyo bites it. All in all this is an okay movie. Some of the scenes involving Gamera particularly the scenes in Toly are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time. If you like Japanese giant monster movies youll really get a kick out of this one. I give it a 4 out of 10. Had this been the unedited Japanese version that I watched it probably wouldve gotten a 5.',neg
'I dont care what some of the reviews said this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you cant expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself a former TV cop brought in by Russos character to coach the cops on how to be TV cops. Those are by far the funniest scenes. If you want to be entertained and just sit back for a laugh then watch this movie.',pos
'With a humor that would appeal to an exclusive small audience the average viewer will find it pointless and monotonous. When Cartoon Network advertised this show it was made to look as if it was a major drama or event complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the Sheep.<br /><br />When it came out on the air I was disappointed at how all the characters were so one-dimensional and a totally bland animation. The only thing that put it to anything close to humor were the names of the characters like Private Public and General Specific a few vague references to cultural aspects and how Lady Richington pummeled Sheep with her steel wig.<br /><br />Slightly off topic but I dont see why would Sheep fall in love with that ball of dirty cotton balls called Swanky. It was hideous!',neg
'This movie is surprisingly good. The ninja fighting sequences were unbelievable. I havent see all Sho Kosugis films but this is probably the best of those Ive seen. Probably the most impressive fighting sequence was at the beginning when ninja killed about 20 people that was one of the most impressive ninja fighting sequences Ive ever seen. Another good fighting sequence was at a cops funeral where the ninja provide more people to bury. The last fight was also very impressive. Also I kinda liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for a ninja-movie actually it was kinda different from other ninja-movies. So if you are a fan of ninja-movies youll probably like this one.',pos
'There is a remark that one of heroines was raped on drunken rampage by Russian soldiers which is completely untrue. This movie should not be shown only because of this.<br /><br />Also there is a statement by someone that KGB prosecuted Jews Gypsies etc which is worse than Nazis. KGB was looking for so called zionist agents who were (KGB believed) imperialist agents. This is totally different from targeting Jewry as a whole nation as Nazis did. Gypsies were never prosecuted. KGB was political tool and used politically but from internationalist standpoint. Communists really did not distinguish between nationalities.<br /><br />Whole movie stinks like fake. Main hero does not speak Russian signs in Berlin contains typographical errors KGB general looks totally phony. Some so called russian proverbs are totally made up and list goes on and on.<br /><br />Not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies and phony stuff. Go to Good shepherd instead.',neg
'how can you take her hard-living glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent? Its absurd. Apart from that the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky the plot is a shallow boring confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused. The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DONT REALLY HAPPEN and then later says that didnt really happen this happened - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) first ladies.

'The 7 rating is not necessarily a smear-- this movie was done on a low budget-- but done well within its limits.<br /><br />A usual pot-boiler plot-- Ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space people and prisoner escape in pods land on unknown planet where their presence wakes something up. Mayhem ensues a lot of ammo is expended.<br /><br />The special effects were spare and properly done emphasizing future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky cheap looking plastic props. Plus the pacing of the story moved without allowing the viewer to lapse into boredom where they start picking things apart.<br /><br />I peg this one as a lite Saturday afternoon flick. You can get up and hit the fridge without pausing it and itll still be enjoyable. Even better your girlfriend can talk all the way through it without damaging your enjoyment-- and shell be happy: after all she got to TALK to you! Its THAT type of movie.<br /><br />Anyways the actual story line has s few holes in after they hit the planet but hey this is a Guns n Ammo action movie. Cohesive story lines are not necessarily required so long as you have Beer and chips at hand. So dont get get yourself into a brain-cramp over the ending.',pos
'Never even knew this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy of it hidden deep in my dusty horror closet. The title on the box said Insect and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80s horror movie. They can surely be fun of course as long as dont expect an intelligent scenario and as long as youre not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make-up effects. Just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in Blue Monkey! The plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal the acting performances are painful to observe and theres a total lack of suspense. Following the always-popular trend of big-bug movies Blue Monkey handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital. The makers couldnt be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over-sized critter! All we know is that its not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant. Other than this theres absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from! Like I said dont get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay. The first half of the film is entertaining enough with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!) but the second half (when the entire hospital is put to quarantine) is dreadfully boring. It is also near the end that Blue Monkey begins to exaggeratedly rip-off older (and better) films. Approaching the climax they apparently ran out of budget as well since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isnt very well camouflaged anymore. Blue Monkey is worth a peek in case youre really bored or if you really want to see every 80s horror movie ever made. Fans of B-cinema may recognize John Vernon (Killer Klowns from Outer Space Curtains) in the small and meaningless role of Roger whos in charge of the clinic.',neg
'This film says everything there is to say about religion - I wish it were required viewing for all bigots and would-be clericals.<br /><br />The story set in a turn-of-the-century Danish villages is about two very religious sisters whose late father was a rigid priest who discouraged all their dreams of love and exploring the world and its many beauty. They are now old and their life and beauty spent. Their quiet new help - whom they teach to cook - is Babette (played by the lovely Stephane Audran who graced so many of her husband Claude Chabrols films). The life in the village is simple and the stark direction reflects that.<br /><br />When Babette wins the lottery she requests a chance to prepare a feast - a true labour of love. The course of the feast and its Chief Guest reveal messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love God and life.<br /><br />This is a must-see for the devotion with which Babette prepares the feast and for the speech the General gives at the end. Possibly the best international film of the 1980s.',pos
'The Daily Mails Christopher Tookey had some choice things to say about this film among them watch it all the way through its 82 miserable minutes and I guarantee youll be shaking your head and asking: Have we really descended to this? Yes we have for if ever a movie testified to the utter cynicism tastelessness and moral corruption of those who commission and make British movies it is this abomination. Tookey continues aimed squarely at oafs with unwashed underwear filthy minds and knuckles that graze the pavement when they walk this sex comedy is so sordid unfunny and malodorous that it is enough to put you off sex and indeed films for life before concluding Sex Lives of the Potato Men is not merely a truly vile film it is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant self-gratification yobbishness and sadism that is now being celebrated on screen. Normally I dont listen too closely to the critics but in this case Tookey was bang on the money. This film goes beyond bad indeed it goes beyond being merely unfunny and enters some bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for an hour and where the definition of hilarious seems to be saying tw*t in a Brummie accent. Its depressing to anyone with half a brain who grew up with the Goodies Monty Python Spitting Image Not the Nine OClock News and Fawlty Towers.<br /><br />Ideally Sex Lives Of the Potato Men would have quietly vanished after its cinema release and joined the equally dire Vix spin-off The Fat Slags (2004) and the ill-starred All Saints vehicle Honest (2000) in the celluloid graveyard but as it seems destined for endless late night schedule-filling screenings and misguided best film EVER! raves from people who should know better so I must apologise in advance for trying to right a wrong that the British film industry in all its wisdom has inflicted onto an undeserving world.

What the hell...trying to evoke memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes ever offered by The Young Ones indeed ever offered by ANY comedy show?! Cheap shot way below the belt.<br /><br />Script - written by a 12 year old whos just read every single back issue of Smut and Zit in one long Red Bull-fuelled session...SURELY? Cmon no real proper worldly grown-up person could possibly set this kind of retarded hogwash on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in it...Mark Gatiss...the least annoying member of the League of Gentlemen and Goodies fan taking part in such a towering heap of fly-blown cinematic excrement? One of the brightest British comedy stars? Not any more hes not! On the subject of League Of Gentlemen somebody give me a pair of lead-lined divers boots and Steve face like a collapsed rectum Pemberton and a long weekend in a soundproofed room before I die...PLEASE...<br /><br />Cinema British or otherwise just doesnt come much worse than this.

'I thoroughly enjoyed Carmen better than Original Sin (Angelina Jolie & Antonio Bandaras) which share some thematic similarities and which I also enjoyed very much. I felt the acting was stronger here (Paz Vega displayed a wider range has more fire; and Sbaraglia was also great). Overall their acting was more gritty more believable (less dreamy than Original Sin and both actors here had less celebrity status and pretty face to depend on to make the movie work. Vega definitely sizzles as to be expected.<br /><br />Director Vincente Aranda has also built a detailed world (again better than Original Sin) that lets you feel the grime and the daily goings-on of archaic Spain - for example people unloading goods from a cart on the street workers changing the candles of the street lamps all in the background of the action. <br /><br />Whilst I greatly sympathize with the recent idea of redeeming our femme fatals (like Brian de Palmas Femme Fatale) Carmen is a poignant modern take in the tradition of the noir classic Double Indemnity and is a delightful pleasure to watch. This is another fine example of the triumph of daring European cinema over glitzy and safe Hollywood fare.',pos

'This film has little to recommend it though that little being the breathtaking scenery cinematography and direction of wildlife it is difficult to bring up its weak points in the company of such rave reviews. It is precisely these things however that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing. <br /><br />I watched this with my children and none of us was too impressed by the end. Yes the pictures were great the broad landscapes across the forest and mountains magnificent but what was going on in the foreground? The rather dull narration of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns all too slowly a very basic lesson about befriending wildlife - and gets off quite easily given the track record of that sort of thing. It is certainly not a new story in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told and we have all seen this before and indeed much more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.<br /><br />The only thing really to be gleaned from this film is a sense of how to work with these wonderful lenses and forest lighting; the rest is a waste of time.',neg

I did not know much about Close to Leo  just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic  Aids. <br /><br />Although the person who has aids  is Leo  the scenario wraps around the way in which Marcel (the youngest brother of Leo) coupes with the sickness of his relative. At first everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel  he is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of his brother  the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young Marcel. I know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves . With exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from Marcel they have left quite an impression for me  the way they supported their son  even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his sickness. The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel along with Leo to Paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them most families I know will be reluctant to do that. There is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together  you can see them being real friends  concern about each other.<br /><br />Close to Leo is an excellent drama which I strongly recommend',pos
'Im rating this pretty high just because of Sam Elliott. I couldve done without the female nudity but Id sit through almost any nonsense in order to see Sam strut his stuff. He gets to spout wonderfully cynical witticisms many of which I agree with and its a joy to see him in a role in which he actually gets to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as can be. My boyfriend opined that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner (in the police sense of the term!) who was a little overeager to prove himself. You can draw your own conclusions on that score but if you like Sam youll like this. You could say Im biased but who isnt in some way? Id buy this on DVD in a heartbeat!',pos
'This movie is painful. Thats probably the best way to describe it. Its 93 minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back. Well actually its more like 86 minutes because there is no way anyone would want to sit through the credits in this stinking pile of dog feces. Immediately you can tell the movie is from the producer of Mortal Kombat due to its thumping and annoying techno soundtrack. This drains the few laughably enjoyable moments this movie can give you. The rest is drained by the completely uninteresting and annoying characters the Freddie Prinze Jr. School of Acting acting abilities of all involved (including the miscast Christopher Lambert) and the non-existant directing. Did I leave anything out? Of course I did. Lets not forget about the suicide-inducing script with its unitentionally (??) funny dialogue. Oh yes and let us also talk about how they shamed the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic/medieval translation. The costumes and weapons (were those giant pizza cutters I kept seeing?!?!) are just plain stupid thats the best way I can describe them. And the last culprit of the night is the always awful CGI. When will filmmakers learn that CGI sucks? When will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80s? Probably never but films like this and Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace make us wish that they would bring them back. In closing avoid this movie like the newest Freddie Prinze Jr. movie. Then again if you like Freddie Prinze Jr. movies then you deserve to sit through this horrid excuse for filmmaking.',neg
'I did not expect much from this film but boy-o-boy I did not expect the movie to be this bad. Chris Rock is not showing a good act here you cant get the feeling that his caracter is real I think the movie would have been a bit better if its drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more/better humor was involved. The movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it. In the making of they dont show a single smile. This is a very bad film! I gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me but I did never laugh!',neg
'Another winner from that 50s  60s era that I love so much for the comedic value they give with each viewing these days .Corman never lets you down with these films  they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets  a recipe for good watching for sure . Ed Nelson a very competent actor got started with Corman as well as many other favorites who show up in Superman and many of the westerns of the day . The costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking  well the reverb was a little off but thats the beauty of it . Film making for the love of it  not looking for perfection just digging the action of doing it  it comes thru . These films are a fun time ! Even better is the MST3K version !!',neg
'This movie embodies the soul of modern elite foodculture even though the movie is 17 years old. The standing principle in the movie is: Food is more than just nourishing matter. It is also a powerful symbol and a medium for culture itself. The main characters literally get drunk on the finest wine and food become inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture as they let go of their puritanism and passion-denying table manners. Karen Blixens shortstory makes use of the difference between North Europe and South Europe to point out their inherently different approaches to food. As the strict and and rather dull scandinavians get infused with Eros from south the party gets going. So what are you waiting for? Go watch it.....again!',pos
'I saw this film with a special screening of the work of Owen Alik Shahadah. It is so interesting where did this guy come from. Now he is probably the key independent African filmmaker in the world. And I am not talking about black filmmakers I am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture. The idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of African themes with his film 500 Years Later it is a African issue. But the Idea doesnt fit that mold. Showing the artistic diversity. The film is an all African cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to. I just love the mild comedy in it. And the Kora of Tunde Jegede is just amazing it is really a art-house gem.',pos
'Proudly and defiantly working class porter Perks(Mr B.Cribbins)is eventually won over by upper middle class family down on their luck. Father(Mr I.Cuthbertson) incarcerated for treason - for which the penalty was death in those dayslest it be forgotten)mother(the very beautiful Miss D.Sheridan)brave and resourcefulloyal and lovingand - principally - older daughter (Miss J.Agutter) tottering on the cusp of adolescence - hurt and confused about the fate of her father. Mr Perkslike many working people of his timewill have nothing to do with anything that he considers smacks of charity and it is a key moment in the movie when he finally accepts that birthday gifts he has been given by the children do not compromise his principles. Although the lovely Miss Agutter has received all the accolades it is Mr Cribbins and Miss Sheridan whose performances dominate The Railway Children.They both know how Edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum but there is an unspoken mutual respect and understanding between them. But this is basically a movie about family.In an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and hold her to ransom and be considered as socially inept rather than unfit to live in decent societyand when two human beings can beat and kick a baby to death without being charged with murderfamily may be seen as an old - fashionedelitist racist even homophobic conceptbut a century ago it was the glue that held society together at all levels.Mr Cribbins and Miss Sheridans families are archetypal for the age.Strong and lovingsticking together against outside influencesintegral units with a moral certainty mocked in the 21st century. What might seem to be a dullpreachy political tract is turned by Mr Lionel Jeffries into a delightful hymn to hopefaithoptimism and courage. That all those attributes were once considered the norm and are now too often the subject of scorn and cynicism is a reflection on our society rather than Miss Nesbits. No one with more than a passing concern for the human condition can fail to be considerably moved by this quite perfect movie.',pos
'First of all I firmly believe that Norwegian movies are continually getting better. From the tedious emotional films of the 70s and 80s movies from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour. Imagine.. Actual comedies were made! Movies were actually starting to get entertaining and funny as opposed to long dark depressing and boring.<br /><br />During the 90s and 00s several really great movies were made by a new generation of filmmakers. Movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money. It became the norm!<br /><br />Then came United...<br /><br />*MINOR SPOILERS* Its just simply not funny. Not once. Not ever. But the thing is... We THINK its funny. Because were used to norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedians. But.. They neither say nor do anything funny! Wheres the humor? Show me the humor! Is it the awkward clerk played by Harald Eia? Is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach? Is it the commentaries by Arne Scheie? The movie is just not funny!<br /><br />But thats not my main rant about United. That namely is the predictability. (And it is here I fear that norwegian comedies have come to a standstill since I have seen this in many other movies as well.) All the time you just know its going to end well. All characters are exactly as they are presented in the start of the movie and everybody gets exactly what they deserve in the end. Theres absolutely no room for surprises at all!<br /><br />All in all I can say that I sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie. It was the one movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in norwegian movie making... again!<br /><br />Rating: 1/6',neg
'This video is so hilariously funny it makes everything else<br /><br />by Eddie Murphy seem very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor which just goes to show you how good this really is). To be honest I dont think that Ive ever<br /><br />laughed at something as much as this including Naked Gun and the rarely seen Bargearse. This show is amazing although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with F that is four letters long (plus its extended version beginning with M) but it didnt bother me. See it the funniest thing Ive ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too.',pos
'This is by far the worst and most stupid show I have ever seen on TV. It is almost physically painful to watch an adult (well in his twenties) doing nothing but torture and mock his parents who always seem to have no clue what so ever about the stunts they are forced to endure by their dimwitted son and his equally stupid friends. Of course I know his parents are in on it but I really hate how they always act like they are caught completely by surprise. It seems fake through and through. And I really hate the intro of the show in which a voice over asks Bam Margera what WILL he think of next?!?! (I think thats how it is anyway) and Bam himself answers: Whatever the f^*k I want! - WOW! Bam is really a hell raiser - living at home with mum and dad! -of course the word f^*k is replaced with a tasteful beep but we get the message. Bam is the real deal rebel - at least in his own eyes. Of course Bam and his posse of numb sculls aim at an audience of teenage boys and of course its a MTV show but please raise the bar a little. Its painfully predictable and stupid and therefore nothing but boring.',neg
'A comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach Lambeau Fields who takes a rag-tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships. In the process this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself saving his relationship with his family and friends and finding that there is indeed no I in team!<br /><br />I decided to watch the unrated version for this film. It was thirty minutes longer and I though it may be better than the theatrical release hearing that people hated this movie. After all thirty minutes of extra footage can add a whole lot to a movie. Well I certainly was wrong. It was as bad as the recent Meet the Spartans but it was thirty minutes more of torture!<br /><br />Seriously who makes a close to two hour spoof movie?! A spoof movie is short because if it goes any longer it would be overkill! Honestly I love stupid comedies. Heck I liked Date Movie White Chicks Epic Movie and Little Man! I guess when it comes to spoof movies it is either a hit or miss and this one definitely missed.<br /><br />On the lighter side from the many jokes in this film I will say about six or seven made me laugh even some that made me laugh out loud. But thats not saying much. Following those jokes were more scenes of torture and unfunniness.<br /><br />I cant see how people would say this is not a terrible spoof film. In fact there is as much product placement in here like Meet the Spartans there are as many dance sequences and unfunny jokes. I will say another thing I like about this movie is the songs. They are some very good songs in here. Overall watch it if you like spoof films. Skip it if you like funny films.',neg
'Everyone does things that they later regret. Things that they wish they could blame on drugs or alien possession. Things that although seem rational at the time later reveal themselves to be engraved invitations for suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity.<br /><br />For some people it is signing the note for the new Hummer for others it is picking up a homicidal hitchhiker for still others it is sending their bank account information to third world millionaires mysteriously strapped for cash.<br /><br />For me it was a film.<br /><br />D-War: Dragon Wars In hindsight I should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recycled this movie would turn out to be from its stuttered and repeating title. But with my willing suspension of disbelief intact and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby I really wanted this film to work. Sadly by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory fifteen minutes into the picture I had the sudden sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film. And worse: I knew just how badly every point would all suck.<br /><br />Let me be perfectly clear here the English language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is.<br /><br />As for knowing all the twists of movie I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla films whose scales this one is not worthy to fill it conveniently sprouted extra sub-plots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue.<br /><br />It was infested with close calls miraculous escapes and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angst.<br /><br />This film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers access to the national defense budget. And lots of liquor.<br /><br />Let me try to explain.<br /><br />Imagine you could get a hold of all the coolest-looking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade: First take the rasta-talking army of amphibians from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac until they are ready to club Navy Seals.<br /><br />Next take close approximations of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (You can even call him Ethan as a subtle nod to the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them lots of film noir narration so no one get confused while trying to follow the wading-pool depths of their thoughts.<br /><br />Finally add a raspy-voiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of King Kong and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day Los Angeles.<br /><br />Now run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine. When you return puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semi-gelatinous.<br /><br />At several points during this picture I found myself saying out loud Make the bad movie stop and breaking into tears.<br /><br />To call this a B-movie would be giving it an undeserved promotion. After summer school and a lot of physical therapy it might possibly pass for a C level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it.<br /><br />In short if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn and the need to punish yourself for hideous unspoken sins against humanity Dragon Wars might just be the film for you.',neg

The historical atmosphere the young girl looking for love the amazing background of music hall and the voyage into the lesbian world of London early twentieth century make this an exceptional movie. Andrew Davies as the scriptwriter excels himself as he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are both excellent actresses and give these parts their best. The rest of the cast are very good. If there was higher than 10 out of 10 I would give it!',pos
'I dont see much reason to get into this movie in much detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo author and survivor of A Season in Hell recruited from prison by his only friend Major Richard Crenna to secretly return to Vietnam take photos of the American prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps and return without engaging the enemy.<br /><br />Fat chance. What if he actually DID nothing more than sneak in take pics and sneak out? Who would come to see the movie? <br /><br />Its essentially a celebration of Stallones muscles. Preparing for his mission we see his well-oiled muscles bulging. (They are oiled and bulging throughout.) There is the ritual strapping on of black leather ugly guns and even uglier knives. The black guns are cleaned assembled with loud clacks and almost as oiled as Stallones muscles. The bow is tested and yes it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemys forehead. The knife is sharpened with slick snicks.<br /><br />Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of the suits from Washington cynical politicians who you can bet were never even in a fist fight in grammar school. No guts you know? Just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer.<br /><br />The movie does what it set out to do but what it set out to do is meretricious. It deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid-1980s that there were uncountable numbers of MIAs quietly kept in wretched camps by the North Vietnamese. The bumper stickers were ubiquitous. (Free Our MIAs.) Why would they keep them? It was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the POWs into a slave labor force -- in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor. Or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States -- a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world.<br /><br />As a captive Rambo is treated in a Medieval fashion by the North Vietnamese. Dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists his muscles still on display. Then not content with subhuman Vietnamese a Russian officer is brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer -- Vee haff vays of MAKING you remember. A high-tech type the Russian uses psychology and electricity not just pig dump.<br /><br />Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until this country loves us as much as we love it bringing up another myth that Vets returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed which is why I guess we elected so many to the Congress and appointed others to high-echelon positions. The last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group. At least Rambos aimless drifting left room open for a sequel which arrived apace.<br /><br />The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but Rambo is humorless. It marches dully through its phantasmal ideological swamp killing without mercy barely speaking barely able to speak. To speak is a sign of weakness.',neg
'We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.<br /><br />This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.<br /><br />The three lead actors Barbora Bobulova as Valeria Brigitte Catillon as Flavia Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.<br /><br />I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.<br /><br />This film doesnt take the easy way out. Thumbs up to the Italian team who put this film together. Highly recommended.',pos
'I just saw this movie and all I can say is where are the drive ins these days. This seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies) but its only worth watching now if youre feeling nostalgic for the 70s. Silly plot that is full of holes but it does remind one of the era it was made in. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive though not much of an actress. In fact there is not much acting going on in this movie at all. Its sort of a Dukes of Hazzard adventure without a twang or a 1969 Dodge charger jumping over stuff in the Woods. But there is a Mecrury Comet jumping over a garbage dump in this one!',neg
'A sleeper. I had never even heard of this movie until I was channel jumping one night. Ive been a police officer myself for 25 years and thought this was a true to life movie.

'Who wouldve imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. The fusion is highly entertaining.<br /><br />Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade I approached this one with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The directors earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.<br /><br />My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a spy thriller. To my pleasant surprise Hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than one might imagine. Hartleys film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks along with a singular cinematographic style.<br /><br />Moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly he is coming into his own. The cast does a fine job of interpreting Hartleys vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will see her in full bloom here still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before.',pos
'What happened? Doubt had so much potential to be a brilliant film - but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching. The only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of Meryl Streep who no DOUBT deserved the Oscar-nomination. Though it was not one of her best performances she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen.<br /><br />However not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill. From the boring start which had no power or punch - to the less than convincing ending the film was truly a disappointment - especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers. It was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film which dragged on for too long with too much talk and not enough action.<br /><br />Furthermore the other Oscar-nominations were less than convincing. Though Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance it was by no means Oscar-worthy. (Especially since they completely left out performances such as Will Smith in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one sided and plain. It would have made more sense to nominate her for a Razzie as I am sure she would have walked away victorious. Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination.<br /><br />Overall I consider Doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008. It was a mess of a film with so much potential and I do not recommend it. The only shining light in the film is Meryl Streep who though gives a stunning solid performance - doesnt even do enough to save this film. *** / 10.',neg
'Ive seen a few of Mr. Boormans movies and didnt like much of them. Not that they are bad movies quite the contrary are good movies but not content I personally found entertaining. However I think Where the Heart Is although made to cater to the less than art savvy American audience is masterful as satire and as social commentary of the times it was made in. Ive had to replace this movie in my collection at least a half a dozen times since every time I loan it out to someone I know could appreciate its artistry on all its levels my copy fails to come back home to me lol. The last time took 7 years to replace it since it was out of print for VHS sales has never been made as a DVD that I know of and had to wait till one of the premium cable channels ran it before I could tape it again.<br /><br />My favorite aspect after the nail-on-the-head social commentary is the paintings by Timna Woollard. Ive searched for 15 years to find anyone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale. Or better yet a copy of the paintings in the movie without the ending credits rolling over them. I have a room in my house that I dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in and no one seems to know if it ever was released as a coffee table book or video aquarium or as a documentary of her work. If anyone does know of where I can acquire any sort of copy of Timnas work or where her studio is in England please do not hesitate to contact me via email.',pos

'Well lets be fair. Following up a cult classic like Road House is no easy task. Now subtract Swayze from the equation and you get a monumental task. So with Patrick not on board whose bonehead idea was it to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage? I am going to blame the director who didnt even provide 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the entire film. I was actually shocked they got Will Patton (Armaggedon) to jump on board. Johnathon Schaech did an OK job with the lead but the writing was atrocious. Turning down his partner brunette bombshell (Crystal Mantecon) in the films first 5 minutes made me want to eject it right there. But I stuck with the film hoping to catch a glimpse of that great cheesy humor that worked so well with the Double Duece. No such luck. The cover of the DVD is hilarious they show these two stacked blondes who make one 10 second appearance in the film. Costar Ellen Hollman actually puts in a decent performance as well. But again the effort is futile in a piece of garbage and disgrace such as this. Has Jake Busey ever been cast in a decent film? Could they not pull at least a few actors in from the first film for some kind of nostalgia treatment? Even one of the old bouncers or two or Jeff Healey for a performance would have been nice. Take this film out of your Queue immediately. -LostFlix',neg
'Dolph Lundgren broods and scowls his way through this incoherent mystery/thriller thats not nearly as cool as the box would have you believe. He is actually quite good here but the story is a mess of B-movie cliches (detectives revenge tycoons hookers S&M) that looks like it was made up as they went along. The film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent Lundgren flick rent RED SCORPION instead.',neg
'Given its time of release the story that unravels in 1950 thriller Panic in the Streets was hardly a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague. Yet with the current drama in the world today this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for todays viewers. The cast and crew are flawless. Richard Widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in Night and the City Jack Palance in his chilling film debut also starring in this film are Paul Douglas and a young (and rather cute) Barbara Bel Geddes. A whole slew of uncredited non-professional actors (typical of director Kazan) fill in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs Joe MacDonald films (he would later work with Richard Widmark again in 1953s much superior Pickup on South Street) and the great Alfred Newman scores it. Nearly everyone involved here has done better work Panic in the Streets is quite the rewarding watch nonetheless. Especially for the film-noir enthusiast.',pos
'I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time. The opening narrative music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone for me. You either love the movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was at his all time best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way. This movie is at the top of my all time favorites a shame it isnt available on DVD or VHS anymore. The ending was also wonderful. John Hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time.',pos
'I like most other people saw this movie after hearing of it from Patton Oswalt. Oddly enough it was easier to find than I thought it would be. Though it shouldnt come as a surprise that I found it used.<br /><br />The plot is summed upped masterfully within the title. Its a bed that eats. Nothing more nothing less. There is an effort to throw in a story line but not a very good one.<br /><br />A demons blood ended up on a bed and as a result it becomes possessed. It devours anything that happens upon it by absorbing and then dissolving it in what appears to be orange Fanta. There is an artist who fell victim to the bed but was sick and ends up behind a painting in the room it inhabits. The narrative is told entirely through him.<br /><br />This movie fails horribly at everything even at being bad. Still its not without its own brand of charm.',neg

The boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly. It was for Radio. The moment I saw the trailer I just had to see this movie on opening weekend. When that weekend rolled along Scary Movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that Friday night. It turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie they went and also sold out Good Boy and Radio. I couldnt get a ticket and the following weeks I was busy with more important things. About 5 months later my friend rented Radio. He let me borrow it and I watched it in my room. Ill tell you this now this is the ONLY movie I have ever seen that got me crying EVER. When Radios mother died it just came out automatically. The next day I went off to Blockbuster and bought the DVD.<br /><br />Well enough of my stupid personal story let me tell you about the movie.<br /><br />Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally challenged man nick-named Radio. Ed Harris co-stars and this movie is directed by Mike Tollin. Based on a true story Radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone. He goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around. Hes got his own collection. At the end of every day he goes home to his mother. He never went to school until later in the film. One day Radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing. A football flies over the fence and Radio picks it up and continues on. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones the football coach. They meet and this is the life of Radio.<br /><br />Throughout the whole movie Radio and Coach Jones spend quality time together both teaching each other things. It is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys the lowest lows and just seeing Radio live his life. You will laugh cry and live the life of Radio with him. This movie holds a special place in my heart along with Toy Story and others. This is a must-see for the whole family by yourself or if youre someone who just wants a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Radio will never be forgotten by me. Never.<br /><br />As Ed Harris character said greatly near the end of the movie:<br /><br />Were not teaching Radio Radio is teaching us.<br /><br />My Rating: 8/10<br /><br />Eliason A.',pos
'My friend Zac rented this movie free of charge since his mom works at a rental store. I still feel ripped off since I wont ever be able to get those 100 minutes of my life back. Having watched the first Dark Harvest the night prior to this viewing I expected to at least see a crappy remake of the first film. Wrong.<br /><br />There isnt a single scarecrow in the movie (unless you count the one of the cover of the box) nor are there any real death scenes. The movie got its R rating from an 8 year old girl screaming god d**n at her father.<br /><br />There is no amount of tequila that could make this movie bearable. Believe me we tried.',neg
'This film has a decidedly weird setting taking place in a school thats really old to begin with but it certainly doesnt look like any sterile medical school environment. Very Gothic and atmospheric. As for the film itself well OK the premise is a bit far-fetched but hey thats why we watch movies isnt it? And its less far-fetched than some of the garbage thats out these days thats for sure. Medical students are experimenting with short term death as in allowing themselves to be briefly dead so they can experience what the afterlife is like. Its kind of nice in some cases till parts of it come back with the voyager and start meddling in their earthbound lives. I hadnt seen this film in years till I got it on DVD and I have to say that Id forgotten just how good it was. And it struck me that Julia Roberts looks truly beautiful in this film not like actresses of today that are supposedly gorgeous but are dressed and made-up like cheap hookers. Ahh the good old days. Anyway this is a great flick perhaps not for fundamentalist Christians but many others may enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars.',pos
'ive discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging. the zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you get to the movie and its women with raccoon masks on. zero special effects...and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet. the funny thing is that Lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie. the only thing i can think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a cult classic...however i cant possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made. the real horror in this film is how bad it is. im embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another Lommel film again!',neg
'Dont be deceived as I was by the glowing reviews quoted on the DVD box. Wildly entertaining. a seriously scary freakout. and the worst of all ON PAR WITH JAWS. This movie is none of the above.<br /><br />Normally I dont bother with writing bad reviews for films but I cant believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on IMDb. It doesnt deserve it.<br /><br />After a so-so opening daylight attack by a monster created by what else chemicals dumped by lazy scientists this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there sloooowly. Basically and improbably a girl is snagged by the monster (Ill give them points for a good creature design but this aint no WETA creation) and her semi-comical family spend an hour-and-a-half tracking her down...in the sewers surrounding the Han river. Their search lacks any suspense-again someone called this on par with Jaws?-and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless. Other than that a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop.<br /><br />Blech. This was bad. Im not kidding. You want to see a rotten monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. At least youll save 30 minutes of your life.',neg
'I saw this movie last year in Media class and I have to say I really hated it. I was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have has something to do with it. But for English this year year 11 we had to read Animal Farm also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution my opinion is that it is a terrible book and I also hated it.<br /><br />But 1984 I think it was the most disturbing movie I have ever seen and I think that George Orwell is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet. Im sorry to everyone who loved his work but I unfortunately did not. The themes in the movie were well portrayed but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not to my standards. This is only my opinion and Im sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this film.',neg
'I feel blessed to own what is known as the worst Steven Seagal movie ever made. I knew I was on to something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone elses voice came out. By the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and I was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter.<br /><br />Steven is Steven (with an ever changing voice) and totally unbelievable in his role (as always). Who the hell lets people with bad nappy-hair pony tail mullets into the Forces anyway? He also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years his junior. The supporting actors all look like theyve been shot in the dark - btw did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a penlight torch for lighting? <br /><br />This is truly abominable in every way possible. Invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this ones truly special.',neg
'I think Ive seen this sort of thing before: college graduates not realizing they have it pretty damn good all the while complaining that their lives suck.<br /><br />This movie is highly derivative of The Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can make of it: they practically have the same plot.<br /><br />If anything good came out of this snore-fest it was the music. That was it.<br /><br />As far as Im concerned Im not impressed... but then again I never expected anything less. This movie was directed by the same person that directed Batman and Robin; another movie that should only be viewed with a blindfold in tow.<br /><br />Now for the verdict: its a 1 out of 10.',neg
'I cannot remember a more trivial mind numbing and shallow film in other words a real chick flick of the worst kind. How can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others ? Only if they dont like admitting they made a mistake. It seems to summarise the worst of female aspirations. No real substance to it all happy and shallow. Yeah thatll please the masses. Well not this member of the masses. What a trivial load of drivel. I wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start. And to think I paid £7 to see this ! I think this does however represent the dumbing down of cinema as with most media these days. So I like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or what ?',neg
'I dont know about you but i go to horror films to be scared and this was anything but scary the movie had several chances to be truly scary and failed miserably EVERY TIME! Several of these supposedly suspenseful moments were haunted by some of the worst cg you will see this year perhaps decade! I mean when i say the cg looks like daytime TV Im giving daytime TV a bad name Ive seen better stuff on the sci-fi channel. Who i really feel sorry for is the actors(that they have their names attached to this film) they did a good job i cared about most of the characters and i felt that their performances were quite good but that was not enough to bring this movie out of the gutter. Whats really amusing is the reuse of some of the sets if you have seen exorcist: the beginning it will be easy to spot the reuse of some of the buildings. However what i thought was the worst thing about this film even above the cg problems was the main demon he was just not scary in anyway his form the way he talked he was extremely bland. all in all this movie was a horrible experience and i would have walked out of the theater if it werent for my wife wanting to see the end.',neg
'Maybe the target audience of this Disney Channel TV-movie will be pleased with it but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters they will clearly see that cranked out is written all over this production. Obviously it was no ones dream to make this movie but rather this was concocted in a board room somewhere then produced with cold efficiency. There is some talent among the cast but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas dont get much of a chance to showcase their talent. The impossibly cute Elisabeth Harnois is engaging as the First Daughter but Will Friedle is stuck once again playing another dumb character though hes not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his Boy Meets World role. The background for this movie is Washington D.C. and the White House but there is no real presidential feel to the film and the Secret Service is made out to be little better than the Keystone Kops when it come to doing their duty. The Disney Channel presents a lot of original TV-movies and most of them are better than this.',neg
'The Godfather Citizen Kane Star Wars Goodfellas None of the above compare to the complex brilliance of The Sopranos. Each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity completely and utterly three dimensional. We care about Tony Soprano wholeheartedly despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs. evil he is evil. Soprano is the most provocative intricate and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history. If youre in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment watch The Sopranos. I defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of Season 1 and not want to continue with the series. Each season is completely brilliant in its own way.

'Oh dear. good cast but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task. Even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right. Im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times. The main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue that made some people in the film annoying. It may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task. And the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film. Overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me but Im sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good. Sorry.',neg
'I really enjoyed Candid camera with Dom DeLuise and I was surprised to see that after the years Suzanne Somers have becomed the co-star of the show. But that was the only positive side of the show - the whole studio the intro the hosts - all that give the new meaning to the word pompous.<br /><br />Well that would be OK if the materials werent so cr*ppy - I mean come on the best you can do is show few men that have problem with getting ketchup out of the bottle Suzanne Somers walking with Halloween basket in July ice cream place that sells only vanilla...? Ive seen few episodes and each time it was horrible. They were posing like its the greatest show ever and then fill the time with scenes so dull that I really felt embarrassed to watch. Even the people in them looked bored and that just cant be good.',neg
'Francis Ford Coppolas masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance open-mindness and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had. I am not a historian but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes the racial struggles the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture the increase of violence and death in the streets...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare be different and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures. Coppolas film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making following the parameters of war and adventure films and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life the reason of death or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work made against all odds chronicled in the 1991 documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen. This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously The Deer Hunter and Coming Home or in latter ones as Platoon and Casualties of War before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre as horror in Jacobs Ladder or comedies as Good Morning Vietnam among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.',pos
'Some movies you watch and you say Well that made no sense. And you dont really mean it. Youre just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical.<br /><br />Bread And Circus makes no sense at all. And I mean it. And thats not because its surreal. From the start its pretty clear its a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects. Theres no script. Theres no plot. Theres no story of any kind. One event does not lead to the next -- thats how fundamental the bad writing is here.<br /><br />So what? I mean there are TONS of movies out there that fall into that category. They want to show you gore they give you gore. Why even talk about it?<br /><br />Because in this case Bread and Circus gave me hope. Okay there are some surreal elements. Vaginas in the ground -- people crawling out of them. The earth in space two legs on either side. These sorts of images are wonderful fun odd crazy. But the movie doesnt do anything with them.<br /><br />Stuff happens the movie ends and its all very unsatisfying. I suspect the script was made up on the fly. Too bad. If there had been a story of ANY kind at all it would have made for a much more entertaining film.<br /><br />The film is very much like the beautiful car you would love to own.

'This series was just like what you would expect from Mr.Spielberg. It is truly one of those frighting funny childish shows that you wont forget. Just like Outer Limits (another great show) this little series does what not a lot can. It was great and deserved to run longer. It was a great show that even kids could watch though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted to be but all of them always had a moral at the end (like the Twilight Zone) that made you realize what situation you didnt want to end up in or ones that you did. I remember watching some of these on Sci-fi when I was 10 and even now I still enjoy seeing them when I can. Truly a fun imaginative show. I loved it and still do.',pos

'A long film about a very important character from South Africa Stephen Biko. He is one of these Blacks who did not survive apartheid who actually died a long time before their normal time. The already old film though does not show how important Biko was what he really represented. His life and his teaching is reduced to little at best a few witty remarks. The film being from 1987 the objective was to push South Africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation. So the film aims at showing how irrational the South African supporters of apartheid are in 1987. To show this the film has to look beyond Bikos death hence to center its discourse not on Biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escaping the absurd system in which he is living. His escape is made necessary because of the victimization he is the victim of along with his family and because he wants to publish the first book on Biko after his death and that can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa while apartheid is still standing and killing. So do not expect this way to be realistic and true. It could not be. But the film has tremendously aged because it does not show South Africa with any historical distantiation the very distantiation that has taken place under Nelson Mandelas presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out. The film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today especially since the film does not mention the third racial community the Indians. Panegyric books or films all have that defect: they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view. That explains why the film has aged so much seems to be coming from so long ago as if nothing had changed at all. A remake is necessary.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines CEGID',pos
'Wrestlemania 14 is not often looked as one of the great Wrestlemanias but I would personally put it in my top 5 if not the top 3. It has so many great things and it truly signified the birth of The Attitude Era which was WWEs best era in my opinion. HBK has the heart of a lion and him putting over Austin like he did on his way out was pure class on his part. It has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see and it has J.R and The King at their announcing best!. <br /><br />Matches.<br /><br />15  team battle royal LOUD pop for L.O.Ds return. Im not a fan of battle royals and this is yet another average one. Very predictable even when you 1st see it its obvious L.O.D would win. Looking at Sunny for 8 or so minutes though definitely helps. <br /><br />2/5<br /><br />WWF Light Heavyweight Championship<br /><br />Taka Michinoku|C| Vs Aguila.<br /><br />Taka gets a surprising pop with his entrance. Fast high-flying and very exciting. If these two had more time they would have surely tore the roof off with their stuff. Taka wins with the Michinoku driver.<br /><br />3 1/2 /5<br /><br />WWF European Championship.<br /><br />Triple H|C| Vs Owen Hart Stipulation here is Chyna is handcuffed to Slaughter. Nice pop for Owen mixed reaction for Trips. A really really underrated match that ranks among one of my favorites for Wrestlemania actually. The two mixed together very well and Owen can go with anybody. Trips wins with Chyna interference.<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />Mixed Tag match. Marc Mero&Sable Vs Goldust&Luna. Defining pop for Sable unheard of that time for woman. Sable actually looks hot and the crowd is just eating her up!. Constant Sable chants and them erupting almost every time she gets in the ring. Not bad for a Mixed tag match it had entertaining antics and passed the time well. Sables team wins when Sable hits the TKO.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock|C|. Before I review the match Id like to note The Rock showed off his immense potential with his interview with Jennifer Flowers before his match. Nice pop for Shamrock big time heat for The Rock. Too disappointingly short and I thought the ending was kinda stupid though Shamrocks snapping antics were awesome to see and the crowd went nuts for it. Rock keeps the title when The Ref reverses the decision.<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />Dumpster match for The WWF Tag Team Championship<br /><br />Catcus Jack&Terry Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws. The Outlaws are not as over as they were gonna be at this time. Crowd is actually somewhat dead for this but I thought it had some great Hardcore bits with some sick looking bumps. Cactus and Terry win the titles in the end.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />The Undertaker vs Kane. Big time ovation for The Undertaker. Much better than there outing at Wrestlemania 20 and for a big man vs big man match this was really good. It was a great all out brawl with The Undertaker taking a sick looking bump through the table. WWE was smart by making Kane looking strong even through defeat. After 2 tombstone kick outs Taker finally puts him away with a 3rd one.<br /><br />3 1/2 /5<br /><br />WWF Championship. <br /><br />Special Guest Enforcer Mike Tyson<br /><br />HBK|C| Vs Steve Austin. Big heat for Tyson. Crowd goes ape sh*t for Austin definitely one of the biggest pops I have heard. Mixed reaction for HBK. This is truly a special match up one of the greatest wrestlemania main events in history you can tell when J.R is even out of breath. HBK gives it his all in what was supposed to be his last match and Austin has rarely been better. The animosity and electricity from the crowd is amazing and its as exciting as it gets. Austin wins with the stunner with Tyson joining 3:16 by knocking out Michaels. Austins celebratory victory is a wonder to behold with one of the nosiest crowds you will ever see King said it right they were going nuts.<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real. It has everything you want in a Wrestlemania and truly kick started the Attitude Era. This is very special to me because it was the 1st Wrestlemania I ever saw back in 98. The Austin Era has begun!<br /><br />9 1/2 /10',pos
'Perhaps one of the first slasher film that came out after Halloween (Although made from Irwin Yabalans from Halloween) I must say I honestly found Tourist Trap to be scarier and funner. Tourist Trap is one of those remarkable treats you find every now and then and are left with the most enjoyable feeling of surprise. It was destiny I tell you but one night I was at my local Blockbuster (One or Two months before it went out of business) and had nothing to get. Then I stumble upon this movie I think huh seems like a laughable B-Movie I rent it and took it home boy was I in for a good scare. Tourist Trap comes off as a bad movie it definitely has its cheesy momentsbut in the end youre having to much fun with it to really care.<br /><br />The things that impressed me the absolute most and the things that made this movie one of the scariest ones Ive seen is number one the setting. A horror movie without a good setting isnt very fun not here. I just love love love the location it feels like we can relate to it it almost feels like weve been there before. Which makes it creepier. Next is the characters non of them are really stereotypical and they all have a real personality. For example theyre not stoners alcoholics or even Sex obsessed people they feel like normal young adults. Plus they look realistic enough and then their is Chuck Connors. Who gives a great performance as Mr. Slausen who we all take an instant liking too because again hes so real he feels like that nice guy grandfatherly figure we adore. The last and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us (the audience) jump half way out of our seats and turn on the rights for the right reasons. For example most of the time in horror films we mainly just jump because of a sudden change in the music pitch but in Tourist Trap prepare yourself thats not the case. With its perfect use of lighting mannequins and weirdness you feel utterly creeped out. Plus I love because although they may go a bit over-the-top with some things you still feel like this could happen. Which is exactly what a horror movie who takes such a ridicules premise should do and that is make us (the audience) feel unsafe and terrified.<br /><br />Overall as far as any major problems go I have none only that its weirdness may get a little too weird at times. However in the end Tourist Trap holds a place near and dear to my heart for being one of the few horror films to make me turn on the lights and feel unsafe about traveling.',pos
'What Foxs fascination with dysfunctional families made up of mean obnoxious spoiled kids and parents who are determined to be cool as opposed to being a parent?? Im sorry I dont get it. The one episode that I was barely able to stomach watching involved one of the kids demanding a Bar Mitzvah with the intention of getting thousands of dollars in gift money. Of course the idiot mother decides that her precious little junior has to have the biggest and bes-test party of all and has no problem dropping 20 grand on the big event. The ditzy brain dead boy crazy teenage daughter bounces back and forth between wanting to be Jewish and then Catholic when she sees the cute religious tutors.<br /><br />The one borderline heartwarming moment in the entire episode was when the putz of a father who has been convinced the entire time that the Bar Mitzvah is solely a money making scheme sees the son studying his Hebrew lessons and is momentarily duped into thinking that perhaps his conniving offspring is being sincere about the right of passage into manhood. This warm fuzzy feeling is immediately ripped out of his chest when he informs junior that since he has not yet had a bris a certain procedure needs to be performed. The Bar Mitzvah is called off and the mother is out several thousands of dollars when the kid refuses to comply.<br /><br />This show is garbage and I am saddened that I shall never get back the 23 minutes of my life I wasted watching this piece of crap because nothing else was on TV ...',neg

'An old saying goes If you think you have problems visit a hospital. That has been updated in recent years to If you think you have problems watch a TV talk show...especially Jerry Springers! This movie is one of those that is so bad its good! Thats why I gave it a seven-its all right but not great. Its a great way to waste 95 minutes just as the daily talk show is advertised as an hour of your life youll never get back! All the familiar themes are here...unfaithful husbands/boyfriends the wildest audience on television women flashing Jerry etc. The shocker was watching Molly Hagan who normally plays sweet characters (Seinfeld and Hermans Head) playing a trailer-trash mom and Jaime Pressly (My Name Is Earl) as her equally trashy daughter performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact. The men (including the staff producer) were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got. I dont want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show. Here in Phoenix its shown back-to-back for two hours every morning and after that everything else seems to pale. Again I give this movie a seven...its good but not great. Jerry Springer is best taken in small one hour doses.',pos

The action set-up is much stronger than the 1st.<br /><br />This movie is getting more of an American feel since 60\% of the movie is in English from the Cantonese.

'Theres something frustrating about watching a movie like Murder By Numers because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out. However by the time the credits roll theres no saving it. The whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplins homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. Although Bullock is strong in her role its not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplins talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated Birthday Girl) as well as Chris Penn who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway the plot really isnt even a factor in this movie at all. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. Its too bad they werent in a much better all-around film. Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. Bottom Line: its worth a rent if youre a genre fan but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial breaks.',neg

'Famous for introducing the world to Hedy Lamarr and full frontal nudity but its oh so much more. In fact this is one of the pinnacles of cinematic poetry up there with some of the seminal works of 1930s art cinema in the same prestigious group as Under the Roofs of Paris Tabu Olympia and even LAtalante. Its nearly a silent relying mostly on its miraculous images and also its fantastic symphonic score by Giuseppe Becce. Its a masterpiece of cinematography and music yes and also of editing direction writing and acting. A good 90\% of the film moves along perfectly. Machatý seems an expert at using motifs. Perhaps not as subtle as it could be and perhaps a bit overused but the appearances of objects like insects lights and horses carry the story forward beautifully. The small snatches of dialogue are thankfully unintrusive. They dont jar as much as one would imagine. The final bit is odd to say the least. Reminiscent of Russian silents we have a montage of workers. This barely makes sense in the course of the narrative but its so gorgeously done that I refuse to harp too much on that flaw. Ecstasy is a film that is desperately in need of rediscovery. It belongs amongst the best films ever made.',pos
'This is a most handsome film. The color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the Metropolitan Opera House in brilliant color. Other indoor scenes at various mansions etc are equally brilliant. As for the music what more can be said other than that Lanzas voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias. The marvelous Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of Lanza in delightful harmony. Of course Hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of Caruso. There is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events. For example the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth. There are some very good web sites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of him. These web sites can be located by using any good search engine. There are also several books available concerning his life history. But the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film. The voices of Lanza Kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie. Enjoy I know that I sure did.',pos

It wasnt thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest. The inclusion of that rambling freak Ramtha in this film is reason enough to avoid it. Isnt it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2000 year old Atlantian god or something? What a flake that old chick is and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was. The people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again.',neg
'Better than it has any right to be this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric at others bitingly satirical and witty Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times laden with drug and sexual humor reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex to the Mel Brooks of The Producers Saturday Night Live to Monty Python Carlin to Cheech and Chong. Watch it listen carefully because some of the jokes go by really quickly and remember a time when comedy was allowed to be offensively hilarious.',pos
'I absolutely like this film a lot. It is not very entertaining but its a feast of bizarre and stunning images! Theres no dialog only some background sounds and noises. If you are into something completely different and original and enjoy the obscure and bizarre...then you might like this work of art. Ik looks like a film made with the very first camera ever made in a time where strange human-like beings live and perform their bizarre habits. God has killed himself with a razor and gave birth to Mother earth. Mother earth impregnated herself with Gods semen after an act of fellatio and gives birth to a son Flesh on Bone. What follows are inhuman acts of ritualistic torture rape and murder for purposes we do not know....or do we?',pos
'This is a racist movie but worthy of study and enjoyment. First time through it the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a relaxed peaceful thing going what with her still at home about to graduate from high school and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something. Second time through you realize how horribly the sisters husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar. He takes it its the thing to do these days and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather. In that same scene the sisters blues song is a real tear-jerker if youre the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music. Her performance feels like the climax of the story; a blues story with the good guys being people of color in their element in backwoods SC. Meanwhile all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies. Thats cool long as you recognize it as fiction.',pos
'Swayze doesnt make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 Scaramouche the 1952 Prisoner of Zenda and the 1950 King Solomons Mines; Patrick Swayze fails utterly. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was very good in an otherwise big flop. Also Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his (shoes)!!! For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlains 1985 version I now highly recommend it if you cant get your hand on the granger version.',neg
'And it falls squarely into the category of awesomely bad - ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of. I was at the sci fi movie festival and all I remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered. Other critiques will better describe this movies fecal nature and I felt oh-so-bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up obviously to gauge the audiences reaction. What he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience and after a serious anime movie I think it was sky blue the audience was in a sombre mood and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles. I will bullet point the worst parts;<br /><br />Script: The funniest and worst part of this movie it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill-thought-out aside. Rubbish but eminently laughable.<br /><br />Animation: Poorly done and put together if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine (I know I can!) then watch out for the montage where she trasforms from a Swedish peasant girl into LADY DEATH!!!<br /><br />Characters: So one-dimensional its painful there is a brief backstory (with side-splitting lines of dialogue) and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters.<br /><br />So in a nutshell if youve got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around (try and make sure theyre alcoholic to ease the pain) then slip this movie into the DVD and get in a mystery science theatre 3000 mindset. There is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it and its not meant to be a comedy. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ALONE. It could possible be even more boring to watch solo than New World with Colin Farrell as you wont be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two.',neg
'The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (set by them also) where his face is scarred by acid. Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school (since closed) for a reunion. What they didnt know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them. Then a storm starts theyre locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />Pretty silly. The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school--but thats about it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (hes stripped has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt) and are just uncomfortable to watch. Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view. Also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity. There is full frontal of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but one girl decides to take a bath alone...AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them! And then theres the couple that has to have sex. This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them. It ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the TV! The acting is bearable--not good but bearable. Caroline Munro is in this too. Shes a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress.<br /><br />This gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere. Otherwise its run of the mill and forgettable. Scuddamores tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves.',neg
'Camp North Star and its Camp counselor extraordinaire Tripper Harrison(Bill Murray)sure would like to end a decades long losing streak to rival Camp Mohawk an ivy league type place where only the wealthy kids can attend. Meanwhile we watch as Tripper tries his hand at love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow female counselor Roxanne(Kate Lynch)as other teen counselors pair up and also fall head-over-heels. The film comes to head at the Camp Olympiad as the rivals square off in competitive athletic contests with Tripper almost realizing their doomed to fail yet another year. The film also shows the growing bond between Tripper and a quietly lonely puppy-dog eyed Rudy(Chris Makepeace of Vamp fame) whose dad is often away all the time. Rudy doesnt seem to fit in with the other kids his age and he seems to spend most of his time either jogging in the mornings with Tripper or taking his peanuts at Blackjack. The film mostly contains hi-jinx of fellow teen camp counselors cutting up and goofing around.<br /><br />You have hottie counselors total nerd Spaz(Jack Blum)with his taped glasses and bad acne beak-nosed Hardware(Matt Craven)who likes to blow things up fat kid Fink(Keith Knight) who is often stuffing his face amongst others in the film. Theres a basketball game where poor Spaz can barely bounce the ball against rival Camp Mohawk much less shoot an accurate shot with poor Fink tossing underhanded between-his-knees fly-balls that sail over the back-board. Theres camp fire coupling(with a spirited scary tale by Tripper about a hook-handed killer)and boys drooling over the lovely ladies.<br /><br />Yes I know its desperate at times trying to squeeze out every laugh it can and occasionally indulges in lapses of sentimentality(such as the scenes with a sad Makepeace and Murray) but just as much as this recent viewing I found myself giggling away. Im licked and just cant help loving this. Its a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you. I cant explain or reinforce enough the overwhelming joy that floods forth when I see a sleepy Murrays hand reach from the covers for the alarm clock thats piercing loudly pronouncing a summer camp movie is about to begin. His intercom jokes are especially amusing. But the flick is lets be honest a series of comic vignettes with Murray dead-panning endlessly..not that theres anything wrong with that. The film though couldnt quite survive without him could it? Hard to even think of this movie without Murray in the lead. Its a happier time and I think nostalgia of that summer camp experience plays quite a hand in why we grown-ups still connect with Meatballs warmly. And poor Morty(Harvey Atkin) the camp head who so badly wants things to run smooth and to beat Camp Mohawk for a change is the constant source of Tripper and gangs amusement as they often play gags on him..especially when hes sleeping on his bed! Great enthusiastic cast who seem to be having as much as us.',pos
'At a time when Hollywood thinks that louder faster and bloodier are better Manna From Heaven is comedic and touching look at something weve all thought about: What would I do if a load of money fell from the sky.<br /><br />Interestingly it took the characters many years to realize that the money hadnt made a single difference in their lives. They all become what they were destined to be. Unfortunately in most cases what they became was unhappy in spite of their good fortune all those years ago.<br /><br />While Manna offers the familiar Hollywood storyline of Good vs. Evil or in the case Generosity vs Greed what sets this film apart is that Good wins out by converting Evil not by crushing it.<br /><br />I think the important message of this film is that you can change the world... even if you do it one person at a time.',pos
'This movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film. Youve got future SNL and SCTV stars in their prime such as John Candy Chevy Chase Laraine Newman Al FrankenTom Davis and Joe Flaherty essentially making 70 minutes of coarse uninspired fart and racist jokes. The concept of a network from the future subverting society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes but instead right out the gate makes a lame juvenile proctology joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole way.Seek out the earlier and much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the later hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie. This movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad 70s sketch comedy movies.',neg
'this is a classic American movie in combination with comedy romance & dream. you may say: there have been lots of these kind of films already. but just believe me youll find this a good one because its well directed scripted and played. Amanda Byness just crazily amazing! shes humor cute & charming both inside & outside the screen. shes the MAN indeed!!! the message i get from it is to pursue your own fairy tale. what i mean byfairy tale is not the one with prince & princess but indicates faith. namely it tells us to hold your faith dream & things that make you regret for your whole life if you dont do that. one of those movies you cant miss out in your life.',pos
'I have nothing against religious movies. Religious people need something to watch on a Saturday night I guess. But what really ticks me off is when the write-up on the DVD box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer. Passing off religious propaganda as entertainment is NOT cool bro.<br /><br />And even if I was a religious person I would have to agree with most of the other posters here this movie was a mess. Poorly directed poorly acted poorly edited and the attempt at a soundtrack was hilarious. The fake accents were terrible the characters were mainly stereotypes and continuity was out the window. The only reason we sat through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. Should have just gone to bed.<br /><br />Absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie unless you are the religious type who will immediately endorse anything that will preach your beliefs to the unbelievers even if its a pile of garbage. If you arent avoid this at all costs. Do not be deceived by the box write-up.',neg
'After reading the reviews it became obvious that everyone intellectualized this work. How utterly boring. Oh how about the good ol days and there was nothing like it. Of all the comments no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other.<br /><br />I grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematic gem along with Danl Boone graced the Saturday afternoon matinées. This was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gabbing yapping farting giggling snot monsters like myself or was-self. And it was a movie theatre filler at the time. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />IMDb insists that every critique contains something about the plot. Problem is was that it was rather a template. Here goes. Randolph Scott (cowboy/hero)gathers friends and goes defeats those evil people. Hooray! <br /><br />All of us kids figured out that plot before we plunked our quarter down to watch it. That was just about the plot line of every Scott John Wayne Roy Rogers film ever made. If you take the time to go back and review each and every movie - just dont ask for surprises.<br /><br />One must remember the context of the times. There was no or little TV. None for kids. There was school. There was the great outdoors. There were toy guns. No Cyber time. And the steam age had just collapsed. But movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the imaginations of young whippersnappers. Even the girls got into it.<br /><br />This movie was the entertainment. And it is just as mindless as anything produced today. It had a purpose originally of being propaganda. But quickly came to be kids movies.<br /><br />Our fathers had experienced the real thing. And it wouldnt be until Sam Peckinpah a decade later who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and copious quantities. Not until his directorship did anyone die slowly with great pain and miserably. Until Peckinpah war and gun fights were a rather bloodless affair. Thanks Sam.<br /><br />To see a movie had little or no blood the adults didnt mind. They wouldnt have tolerated it I think. No guts spraying the shattering plant life. So this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory. Gung Ho was suitable for kids then.<br /><br />You will see that I assigned a four to this rating. Why would I do that? Well. It is a terrible movie. No matter how I love it. I do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood. But it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms. Basically Gung Ho transitted to become a romance novel for children.<br /><br />Should people watch it. Of course. I am not saying to stay away. Realistically however. The plot is simple. The characters shallow? they are shoals. You can love a bad movie.',neg
'One can always tell if Im enjoying a movie by the number of times I cross my legs switch positions make slight rustling noises etc. etc. The lesser = the better. I moved so many times throughout this movie that I succeeded in knocking over my friends giant tub of popcorn and getting a huge thigh-strengthening workout.<br /><br />Sobieski a young actress who at some points in A Soldiers Daughter Never Cries gave some promise for her thespian talents played poorly in a poorly-written part. Depressing fact number one. Number two: Chris Klein was in it. Depressing fact number three: Chris Klein had lines. Number four: Chris Klein played a valedictorian. Woah. Dummies from rich families unite! Even worse he actually tries to act but only succeeds in sounding like a mentally disabled overactor in an increasingly sappy independent version of a Cecille B. DeMille film. Go back to humping your American Pies.<br /><br />This movie was terrible in almost every sense save Josh Hartnetts mildly endearing performance as LeeLees stiffed boyfriend Jasper. Luckily he refrains from trying to have too many moments unlike all the other characters. Of course this is why hes much better than the rest and he actually shows some mettle here. If you like Josh or are thinking of casting a kid who knows a few things hes your man. <br /><br />Hartnett is a sharp actor but the rest need no further lambasting.<br /><br />2 out of 10 (for poor Hartnett in this terrible film)<br /><br />',neg
'Take Fame and Youve Got Served and roughly jam them together and what do you got? This God awful movie custom made for dull-normal adolescents. The plot very closely follows Youve Got Served. Three ghetto afro-teeners this time living in John Waters Baltimorenot far from Peckers homespend their time getting failing grades in high school and dancing in dilapidated 100-year-old buildings with hoochy-mamas. To finance their expensive baggy hip-hop clothing tastes they steal cars and deliver them to the local chop shopnot unlike John (Tony Manaro) Travolta who worked in a Brooklyn paint store so he could purchase his polyester disco clothes.<br /><br />Tyler Gage one of the black three musketeers gets caught trashing the local Fame High School and is forced to perform janitorial duties. He meets Nora Clark a 26-year-old white high school student and discovers hes Irish-American much to the chagrin of his black buddies Mac and Skinny.<br /><br />As in Youve Got Served crime doesnt pay and Skinny the youngest member of the trio gets shot by a Bad Bad Leroy Brown typebut that doesnt stop the musicand heart-stopping finale.',neg
'Today being Presidents Day my wife and I had The Notebook DVD checked out at our local library. Its a movie released in 2004 that fell beneath our radar as we are big movie goers. Im a published author with hopes of screen playing my first book. Id noticed references to The Notebook in reviews of other movies which is why I brought it up about us watching and this morning provided the perfect opportunity. We both really liked it. It made my wife cry; we could relate to many things in it with our own continuing love affair and even I fought back choking up.<br /><br />This afternoon after lots of chores yard work and eating we decided to actually catch a matinée. When we got to the theater having seen most of the current batch of films playing we elected to see Victoria Day which for some reason was not at the theater even though both IMDb and my phone movies showed it playing there. So instead we looked at the poster for Dear John and that it was written by the same writer as The Notebook making it the obvious choice as we enjoyed TN so much.<br /><br />What a disappointment! First the characters did not have the same believability or sense of empathy as TN; and we kept commenting throughout all the similarities -- two dozen or so -- quickly causing us to realize this movie was nothing but as another reviewer commented a poor mans Notebook! It had a real cash cow feeling meaning the Sparks simply threw a story together based on the exact template of TN simply to make a quick buck. Not only that after the bug-eyed trollop improbably Dear Johns-John for the wimp cancer patient we ridiculed the movie with each passing soapy stupid line all the way through to the end. There were only about 6 of us in the theater during this 4:45pm Monday matinée and my wife even told me to keep it down so I wouldnt ruin it for the others...it was so bad.<br /><br />Seeing this on the heels of TN ensured that the rip off similarities were vividly recognizable and Sparks blatant cheap attempt at template writing painfully obvious. We only wish we couldve seen Victoria Day instead...no matter how bad it mightve been after seeing this poor entry to cinema. And oh... for the last 30-minutes I kept saying ...dont give that cow the coins ...dont give that cow the coins?',neg
'At first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction. However the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the World War II era Army. The recognizable cast is hit and miss with Glynn Turman Richard Pryor and the underused Billy Dee Williams faring best. Stephen Boyd however stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn.<br /><br />The obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values. The locations are great the effects and action are weak. Imagine if Saving Private Ryan had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way Vin Diesels Caparzo had (except we do get to see the shot because they effects cant handle it) then Hanks Damon and Burns drove around in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax. Yet the denouement with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black and Boyds racist Captain being effected by this is compelling as are the sequences of of Turmans character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines.<br /><br />In short Black Brigade/Carters Army doesnt quite succeed. But its a respectable failure not a bad joke. It could be remade as a very good film and as it stands is an interesting effort.',neg
'Not since The Simpsons made its debut has there been a sitcom that I didnt want to turn of in a matter of 2 minutes. It has of course been said that The Simpsons killed the sitcom. Not this one though.<br /><br />The first season was so so as the teenage characters were not quite as outrageous as they later became. They even went to school sometimes. The following seasons the character where fledged out. Eric the sarcastic twit Donna his levelheaded girlfriend Kelso the dim bulb Hyde the conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk Fez the pervert exchange student and finally Jackie the spoiled rich floozy. As for the adult characters there was Erics mom the can you believe she is so ditzy suburban mom Erics dad the straight arrow who of course wasnt such a hard ass as he seemed Donnas goofy dad and her dumb blonde mom. Everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to Kurtwood Smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his Red Forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness.<br /><br />Topher Grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good. Its a tough character to play because it doesnt allow the actor to indulge in wild overacting like the Kelso character played competently by Ashton Kutcher. I enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different.<br /><br />Hydes character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time although I will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons.<br /><br />Jackie played by Family Guy voice artist Mila Kunis is hilarious and she has a nails on a chalkboard type voice which actually fits her character. The only sad part is that we didnt see more scenes with her and Eric because they were f...... hilarious together. Too much story was wasted on her relationship problems since we already got that in spades with Eric and Donna.<br /><br />Last I will say that the casting of guest actors were always great. A few favorites: Fez humongous girlfriend in the mid-seasons Pastor Dan the totally awesome Leo played by the equally awesome Thomas Chong another one of Fez girlfriends who is totally certifiable and a special appearance by the teenage witch Sabrina as a slutty catholic girl.<br /><br />Coming up next on Fox whatever.',pos
'A film like Crossfire puts another film that spreads around its social consciousness- i.e. the recent film Crash- almost to shame. Not necessarily because either one puts forth its message of intolerance-is-rotten more significantly (although Id wager Crash throws the hammer down much more thickly in comparison with this) but because of how the storytelling and contrivances never get much in the way like with Crash. Maybe its not really necessary to compare the two as Crossfire is in its core all deep into the film-noir vein like its going out of style. It was interesting actually to see what the director Edward Dmytryk said on the DVD interview where he mentioned that the budget for the photography was significantly lower (on purpose) so that more could be spent on the actors and the schedule went through at a very brisk quick pace. But then what comes off then as being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting set-ups that it took a lot to do. Just for a small scene like when Robert Mitchums Keeely first goes in for questioning under the Captain Robert Young- the contrasts of shadows seamlessly in the room is exquisite. That there are many other lighting set-ups that go even further with so little marks this as something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period. Just take a look at a shot of characters on a stairwell the bars silhouetted against them and see what I mean.<br /><br />But back to the substance part of the film- its really a story that consists of a murder mystery but one that we as the audience dont take long to figure on the answer. Its then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that wouldnt be found in a common crime picture then as there are really no criminals for the most part in the film. Theres a very calculated risk with this then that characters could be too thin just to prop up the (worthwhile) message against anti-semitism. But Dmytryks direction of his top-shelf cast along with a really terrific script by John Paxton fleshes out the characters least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message. And what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it? Mitchum helps that along even in scenes like between him and Young where its very much based in the situation of the storys moment (i.e. a detail in the plot) by injecting a little sly wit into some of the dialog. It may already be there in the lines but he helps make the character with a good edge for his scenes.<br /><br />Then theres also Robert Ryan who excels at Montgomery as a man who you know you dont like much at first just through his b.s. demeanor but youre not totally sure about either. Then once it starts to come clearer- ironically through a subjective view-point of the suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) at the apartment of the soon-to-be-deceased Samuels- his performance becomes a great balancing act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blind-way. Its a good performance when also countered with Cooper who has actual personal issues that he faces and comes forward with regret and humility. Its really after the film ends that one thinks about a lot of this however and while youre watching the film its more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scenes and in the sometimes stark overpowering camera moves on the actors so the message is in a way secondary. Not that it isnt an important one especially for the time period (coming right off of WW2) but years later its seeing the actors even the ones that dont get the big marquee status like Gloria Grahame as Ginny (the femme fatale of the picture if it couldve had time for one which it doesnt) and William Phipps as Leroy (the hick) working off one another that sticks much strongly in the compacted screenplay.<br /><br />Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too as for very long stretches we hear nothing and mostly when it does come up its incidental to the characters surroundings. He couldve just as easily gone with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes for emphasis most specifically the opening audience-grabber into the film. By sticking clear of that and getting the right attitudes and nuance in camera and cast it uplifts standards in genre material to a very fine memorable level. My favorite scene would probably go to Finleys story about an Irish immigrant he tells to Leroy where all such elements come into place well. It might not come in very high at the top of my favorite noirs- and Id still throw-down Murder My Sweet as the directors masterpiece in this kind of picture- but its assuredly higher in quality than something of the B-level too.',pos

'Oliver! the musical is a favorite of mine. The music the characters the story. It all just seems perfect. In this rendition of the timeless classic novel turned stage musical director Carol Reed brings the Broadway hit to life on the movie screen.<br /><br />The transition from musical to movie musical is not an easy one. You have to have the right voices the right set the right script and the right play. All signs point to yes for this play. It almost appears that it was written for the screen!<br /><br />Our story takes place in jolly old England where a boy named Oliver manages to work his way out of the orphanage. He winds his way through the country to London where he meets up with a group of juvenile delinquents headed by Dodger the smart talking quick handed pick-pocket. The leader of this gang is named Fagin an older fellow who sells all the stolen goods.<br /><br />But all is not well in London town when Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed and his loving girlfriend Nancy get tangled up with Oliver Fagin and his young troops and the law. What ensues is a marvelous tale of love affection and great musical numbers.<br /><br />Whether or not you like musicals or not one listen to these tunes and you will be humming them all day long. Oliver! is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art.',pos
'Cmon lets put aside the sophomoric humor that we can find in racism and be honest...it isnt funny. I was appalled at the fact that the two main stars would agree to do a film that was so offensive and so detrimental to race relations and Im not referring to the obvious black/white commentary in the movie but to the slams towards other ethnicities such as Betty Whites characterizations of the hispanics. Should we just chalk up her agreeing to do this movie as a sign of senility...is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical trash? Or is it the fault of the writers? How about the third assistant makeup person??? Nope the fault is with us for perpetuating this kind of crap (in the guise of comedy) that hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say enough is enough...racism is for real and it isnt a laughing matter.

'Ill tell you a tale of the summer of 1994. A friend and I attended a Canada Day concert in Barrie and it was a whos who of the top Canadian bands of the age. We got there about 4am waited in line most of the morning and when the doors opened at 9am we were among the first inside the gates. We then waited and waited in the hot sun slowly broiling but we didnt care because the headliners were among our favourites. At one point early in the afternoon I sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier. I was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a Rheostatics t-shirt. This is the reason I have hated the Rheostatics to this day. Theres nothing reasonable nor taste-determined nor really anything except their fandom. Snotty of me isnt it? So I in my hatred of the band have denied myself the delight that is Whale Music.<br /><br />Desmond Howl had it all. Its hard to say what hes lost since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains (the BC region where the movie was shot is breathtaking). The life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams phantoms and his own past until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in...and trite as it sounds breaks him out.<br /><br />Canadian cinema suffers from several problems. Generally a lack of money as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help (as if somehow the feature would cease to be Canadian) leads to lower production values than American or British films and most people dont like to watch anything that sounds or looks like well not like an American film. Next Canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story and tell it well. Third they seem to think that gratuitous nudity (often full-frontal) makes something artistic. Im sure anyone who watches enough Canadian movies especially late at night on the CBC knows exactly what Im talking about. Its almost like a dont do this handbook exists out there somewhere and Canadian film-makers threw it out a long time ago.<br /><br />In the 90s and 00s however some films (such as Bruce McDonalds work and the brilliant C.R.A.Z.Y.) have broken this mold and managed to maintain what makes them Canadian while holding onto watchable production values and great stories. Whale Music is such a film on the surface. Deeper than just its Canadian-isms its a deeply moving story of a man whos lost his grip through grief and excess who is redeemed by music then by love. And that redeems even the Rheostatics. :)',pos
'Teamo Supremo are three kids consisting of their leader- Captain Crandall Rope Girl and Skate Lad all with their own battlecry (buza! chika! woopa!) and outfit and moves. They work for the governor Kevin and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game.

From an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil and often strange plans to gain power take revenge etc.<br /><br />The animation itself is quite nice and smooth but the style appears to be simple on purpose. The backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic. The music is quite nice and the show isnt too bad altogether although the style isnt my favourite.<br /><br />The plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous but after all this is a cartoon and one cant blame them for that. However this would not be in the same rank as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.',neg
'I supposed I was actually expecting a Bollywood remake of The Fog from the title but this is actually more of a Bollywood remake of I Know What You Did Last Summer with some elements of Scream kind of sort of and not a very good one either. Apart from a couple very entertaining song & dance numbers this is pretty terrible. Its obviously got a decent budget & yet its wasted on reheated leftovers that werent that tasty to begin with. A young woman is threatened by a creepy guy to not enter a beauty contest because he wants his sister to win (she thankfully doesnt look as creepy as her brother) but she enters anyway and wins and of course the creepy guy comes after her and is killed after which comes a rousing game of hide the body. Of course the body disappears and no one seems to know why but someone knows and theyre waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous plot twist. Interspersed with all this tired rehash are a few nifty dance numbers especially the celebratory dance number at the party for Simran the girl who won the beauty contest...its highly colorful its well done & downright fun and utterly wasted in this terrible film. I would much rather watch an old Ramsay brothers movie than this piece of crap although someone has deemed that these dont need to be made available for the most part which is a crime in itself. But not as big of a crime as this film. I took one for the team watching this one so take my advice dont bother. 2 out of 10.',neg
'This films trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD. However the resulting movie is absolutely dire! Admittedly this is not the worst film ever made or the worst film this year but it came damn close!<br /><br />The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy adult drama thriller teen-porn? The story is interesting as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides but the film is a mess. What starts out as a mildly interesting comedy (a word I use in the loosest possible terms) then goes totally in reverse and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better and Ben Chaplin is wasted! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel whom I can only presume did this for the money.<br /><br />This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. Its not funny its almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. A film to be avoided unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films!',neg
'Everyone has a first love and though it is hard to define that feeling when youre younger it is there aching inside you. That is what Malaysian filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad aims to prove in her fourth feature a movie where that most complex of emotions is recounted in a deceptively simple straightforward fashion.<br /><br />Such an approach is especially convenient in this case as the love story at the films core involves two twelve-year olds and would therefore make any attempts at deeper analysis seem contrived and pretentious. That they dont is also testament to the astounding performances given by the leading non-actors Sharifah Aryana and Mohd Syafie Naswip. The former plays Orked (already seen as an adult character in Ahmads previous picture Gubra) a lively almost rebellious girl who perhaps influenced by her British upbringing (her mother studied in England) despises playing with dolls preferring to play violent sports with the boys. Then one day she meets Mukhsin (Naswip) who has come to spend the holidays at his aunts house and all of a sudden she changes her habits: goodbye fistfights hello bike-riding and tree-climbing. But what does this mean? Are they just friends or is something more implied something neither of them is yet ready to understand let alone accept?<br /><br />Given the young age of the protagonists answering those questions borders on impossible and so like in several smaller films (Lost in Translation comes to mind) there is no real closure a choice that leaves a bittersweet but ultimately satisfying aftertaste: the naturalistic unfiltered acting (especially Aryanas) gets to the heart almost immediately and a strong supporting cast (Orkeds family most of all) helps keeping the minimalistic narrative fun and seducing. The down-to-earth approach isnt always that effective (the hilarious subplot regarding an adulterous neighbor is dropped way too early) and it is hard to justify the bizarre Pulp Fiction reference at the start of the feature but the emotional strength of the teenage romance is enough to make this an interesting piece of independent Asian cinema.',pos
'Its hard to tell if this ham-brained B-movie adventure is a spoof a homage or just plain bungled but it doesnt work whichever way you look at it. Based on Michael Crichtons so-so novel its a nutty mixture of lost cities giant hippos monster monkeys naff visual effects and corny dialogue. The first thing that scuppers this tosh is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language and needless to say the film doesnt get any better from that point on. Making all this old rope somewhat worthwhile are Tim Curry turning in a feverish slice of ham and sporting a bizarre accent that defies identification and Ernie Hudson who also seems to know that this is all a load of old rubbish.',neg
'This is a good film for 99\% of the duration. I feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim.<br /><br />It is shot in a rather naive fashion. This is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique.<br /><br />The gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the nutcase called Joe. However the wholesome (normal) characters are a little too pathetic for my liking - granted they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little OTT.<br /><br />The film starts slowly (and the naive camera work smacks of B movie to start with) and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur. This is one of the most twisted movies with respect to cold-hearted violence.<br /><br />After the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending I was left feeling disappointed. I would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the eeriness and nail-biting scenes earlier on in the film.<br /><br />Give it a watch and excuse the ending!',pos

This movie had sexual overtones since it is about a underground S & M killer. The acting was bad except Michael Madsens parts. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he got paid well for this lousy movie. It is something I would not be proud of. It is not even a B movie for cable it is more like a F and it should never be shown ever.',neg

All the leads are well acted the characters complex and the directing quite competent for this type of picture. A Crown International Release.',pos
'The Dereks did seem to struggle to find rolls for Bo after 10.<br /><br />I used to work for a marine park in the Florida Keys.

There was one scene where a -dolphin- supposedly propositions Bo (or Bo the dolphin) asking to go make eggs. Reading the script we -lauuughed-...<br /><br />We did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility although our dolphins -were- in The Big Blue!<br /><br />This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinns life.

'The plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify AS plot and character. The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark out-of-focus and blurry. The fact that Fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesnt help. On the other hand the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence. The inconsistencies are pretty entertaining one of the main characters says he has no friends yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time and has a whole gaggle of women on the side. Though he does show his anti-social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b*****d whos just minding his own business!Images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from Fulci. Maybe it ruined his career but it wasnt really much more stupid than Zombie. Worth a rental if you like gory Italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre. How do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help?',neg
'Probably Bigas Lunas finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze eroticism and surrealism. The delicious Mathilda May who spent most of Tobe Hoopers Lifeforce in the buff is the object of young Biel Durans pre-teen lust. He cant get Mays breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother too. His pursuit of May IS the film. As in Luna works such as Lulu and Jamon! Jamon! the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale. The usual suspects will be offended but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast. José Luis Alcaines images are gorgeous and Nicola Piovanis score is sweet and rich. A gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the Spanish do so naturally.',pos
'Why oh why wont they learn? When youve got a nice juicy exploitation gimmick use it! Dont go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful; youre only gonna wind up looking foolish.<br /><br />Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling who saw a little bit too much of Mommy kissing (Daddy-dressed-as-)Santa Claus back when he was a kid. So of course Harry grows up obsessed with Christmas and finally when his disillusionment becomes too great he flips out dresses as Santa and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children and viciously killing anyone he deems naughty.<br /><br />Simple enough and not a bad place to start. (After all how many other holiday-themed horror flicks use the same schtick?) Unfortunately this film wants to be more Santa Portrait of a Serial Killer than Silent Night Deadly Night. Two-thirds of the film are spent documenting Harrys slow but inevitable breakdown when I would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling. You know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to just get on with it already.<br /><br />Perhaps Harrys descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director but alas weve got some guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently this is his only film and it shows. The action jumps giddily from scene to scene without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing.<br /><br />Even once the film gets rolling were still treated to heaping helpings of Harrys self-pity insecurity and neurotic behavior. More depressing than frightening Christmas Evil is one to avoid.',neg
'Im giving it a three instead of the lower number it deserves because of its history. A full-length movie made by high school students! It shows too but thats part of the charm and appeal. Get ahold of some of the stuff George Lucas did at UCLA; this is better. Maybe due to being a group effort.<br /><br />A monster made of toxic waste and too much garbage--these kids were way ahead of their time!--starts ravaging the town of Milpitas during a high school dance. The monster destroys randomly leaving garbage and smelly footprints.<br /><br />The movie has local TV and radio people the Milpitas mayor the Samuel Ayer High School principal and a whole bunch of the high school students and their parents not to mention the mayors daughter as the ingénue.<br /><br />Dumb? Yeah! Fun? Yeah! Great screen writing? Cmon theyre untrained high schoolies! Copy that comment for the acting cinematography directing et cetera.<br /><br />Milpitas is right next to San Jose in the heart of Silicon Valley; maybe one of the graphics geniuses there will update the video somehow.

'Warning: Does contain spoilers.<br /><br />Open Your Eyes<br /><br />If you have not seen this film and plan on doing so just stop reading here and take my word for it. You have to see this film. I have seen it four times so far and I still havent made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film. That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film then stop reading right now.<br /><br />If you are still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think.<br /><br />I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well. His name was Mr. Krisak. To me he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you werent all too keen on. If we didnt like Shakespeare then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it. Our class room was never a room it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time. This was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds. <br /><br />I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind like the phone number of a long lost best friend and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix. Now if I didnt know better I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak. But giving them the benefit of the doubt well assume it wasnt him. But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. <br /><br />He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real. Show me how you can tell that you are real. This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that Im sure you can imagine. Everything from pain to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real. After every scenario that we gave him he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless.<br /><br />What if you are nothing but someone elses dream?<br /><br />What if you were someone elses dream? What a messed up question that is. This was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computers. How possible could it seem back then? But if you look at todays technology now ask yourself what it you were a part of someone elses dream.<br /><br />Another brilliant but surreal film this year David Lynchs Mulholland Drive explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to. In short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you.<br /><br />Open your Eyes.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays David Aames a young hot shot righteous full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy his board of governers the Seven Dwarfs think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. <br /><br />Early in the film we meet one of Davids gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous committed relationship. This is the type of relationship commensurate with Davids other flings hes had in the sexual prime of his life. And although both talk a good game we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. <br /><br />Next we meet Brian Shelby played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smiths good buddy Jason Lee. Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends. This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film. Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again. And that is  the sweet aint so sweet without the bitter. He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two.<br /><br />At Davids huge birthday bash (so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date Sofia Sorrano played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress. This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another. And in typical David fashion despite his best friend being there he begins to flirt with Sofia. To complicate things Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David. David then spends the night with Sofia but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another. There is no hanky panky. The next day as David is leaving Sofias apartment he is greeted by Julie who offers him a ride and from there.......well I think we have all seen the commercials.<br /><br />That is all I will really say about the plot because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception. We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze. There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us but it doesnt end there.<br /><br />Like many movies seem to thrive on today this film has a secret. Sixth Sense may have began this craze but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze. Regardless of how it originated Vanilla Sky has one of its own surreptitious gut busters. And what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through. I have seen this film four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up something more I can understand. To be able to work your mind in the theater to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film. All of the ersatz so called Best Pictures of the year have been good but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it. I know this film has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who dont like it dont quite understand it. <br /><br />This is what film making is supposed to be like. This is what a film is supposed to do to you. It is supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces. This one isnt.<br /><br />10 out of 10 The best film of the year. I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress Diaz for best supporting Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe should there as well. None of this may come to pass and that is a shame. This is one film that should not be missed. <br /><br />And on a final note I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question. Can you prove you are real? Or are we just a figment of someones imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone elses bemusement? This is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers. And Im sure that is just fine with him.<br /><br />Open Your Eyes',pos
'This movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown America for a young girl on her own. The realism and subtle nuances offered to Ashley Judds character Ruby by the storyline capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of Florida. From the slam of a screen door to the lack of work the echoes of what life is really like on the red-neck riviera provide rough choices for the young girl. Paradise did not come easy. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit and learns to be her own woman with a strength that flows from within. Ashley Judds winning smile and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration. The careful pace of the character development resembles that of Ulees Gold in 1997 starring Peter Fonda and also directed by Victor Nunez.',pos
'I did not think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time I like CKY and Viva La Bam a lot more. I think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie. I highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam CKY or Jack Ass should see it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. I think that Jonny Knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from Haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more.',neg
'Now that I have seen it it was NOT what I was expecting at least not until the very END. I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from Amazon and was glad I did. Having been first introduced to Parks work via Oldboy I was curious to how hed treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it. I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because while Oldboy and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other vamp movies. For example the scene where Father Hyeon is realizing the beast growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot Tae-ju and he is able to SEE the blood pumping through Tae-jus skin and his eyes widen in blood-lust for it. That was a nice effect. I was also happy that Park did not CG the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little CG at all. I came away from Bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true Park fashion. Additionally I liked that Park played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we dont usually get this is Asia cinema. During the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring. Park treats you a little like Ghost of Christmas future coming to show you albeit a bit boringly what life is like outside your world. Ah but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen Father and his burgeoning lust for Tae-ju and conflict with duty as a priest. We almost start to root for them even until Park not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end Bakjwi is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong. It wont spoil it if I tell you to watch Bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and I think youll come away from it with what Park wants you to come away with. Dont expect Oldboy and stylization because thats not what youll get here. A very interesting take on the genre indeed. Those who missed the MANY literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie not Bakjwi. After Bakjwi watch Let The Right One IN its also not what youll expect either.',pos
'Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austens tone manner feeling wit depth was diluted if not lost. If some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern (his life is one long party?????) The cast was generally adequate but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice it needed someone more restrained I gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior she was more like a frolicking child. I see I must wait for the BBC to weave its magic once again.',neg
'Although the premise of the movie involves a major coincidence the actors all do a creditable job and look great bringing the story to life. I found myself rooting for the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti empathizing with both and wanting them to reconcile. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are fine in their roles as well doing a decent job with the stereotypical buddy relationship. While the story tends to leap through time occasionally leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry for missing detail it still flows and avoids any real confusion. This interesting storyline has all the elements for a good chick flick.',pos
'This has no relationship to Virtual Encounters 1 so its not really a sequel. The two videos just share the general concept of people having simulated sex through a virtual reality machine. So if you were really blown away by the story and dialog in VC 1 (yeah right) and expecting a continuation in VC 2 just be warned. All the actors and actresses are new but it has the same excellent director Sybil Richards.<br /><br />But like VC 1 you get lots of beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that push the envelope of soft core just about as far as it can go.<br /><br />If you have VC 1 and you liked it youll like VC 2. If you dont have either but like really good softcore sex get both.',pos
'The 1983 BBC production of Jane Eyre starring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton (LOVE HIM) has always been and will always be my favorite Jane Eyre. If you watch any other version of Jane Eyre without reading the book it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day. But watching this one almost equals to reading the book. I used to watch these miniseries a lot when I was little and they inspired me to read the book. At the time I didnt pay attention to how close this television production was to the book. Recently I watched the 1996 version of Jane Eyre and was very disappointed. It was only 2 hours long and didnt have many important scenes from the book (such as my favorite gypsy scene). After that I fell in love with This Jane Eyre even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story( the other versions dont if you havent read the book). <br /><br />The cast of 1983 Jane Eyre is excellent. Its true that Timothy Dalton is a very handsome actor (handsome enough to play Butler in Scarlet and Julius Caesar) but he is so great as Rochester that I cant imagine anybody else playing this role. And Zelah Clarke is without a doubt the only Jane that follows the description of the book. The other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors. Jane looks so modest and naive just as Bronte describes her (although she doesnt look 18 but do you actually pay attention to that?...) <br /><br />Some people say that this Jane Eyre is too long but I would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching some other version. Some say the movie is dull and boring because Jane is not passionate enough or because there are not enough kissing scenes. I hate when they make Jane Eyre some Hollywood movie with inappropriate kissing scenes. You dont have to include crazy madly in love scenes to show the love between Jane and Rochester. And both Zelah and Timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no other scenes needed!! I am 19 years old and many girls of my age refer to this film as boring and old-fashioned. But I can only feel sorry for them because they dont appreciate the purity and beauty of it. After all the novel is set in 19th century and that old-fashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book. <br /><br />I dont think there will ever be any other version of Jane Ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one. No matter who plays Jane and Rochester in other movies the real Jane and Rochester (for me at least) will always be Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton!',pos
'Man I had my doubts. I love Kathy Bates but I thought how good can this be I had never even heard of this thing...!

'Delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film is also casting some of the great actors of our time not just from France but from everywhere.<br /><br />My favorite segments:<br /><br />14th arrondissement: Carol (Margo Martindale) from Denver comes to Paris to learn French and also to make a sense of her life.<br /><br />Montmartre: there was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this segment on romantic Paris.<br /><br />Loin du 16ème: an image of Paris that we are better aware of since the riots in the Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time taking care of somebody elses kid (shes a nanny) than of her own.<br /><br />Quartier Latin: so much fun to see Gérard Depardieu as the tenancier de bar with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce.<br /><br />Tour Eiffel: dont tell me you didnt like those mimes!<br /><br />Tuileries: such a treat to see Steve Buscemi as the tourist whos making high-contact (a no- no) with a girl in the Metro.<br /><br />Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great.

'I saw this movie when I was a kid and have been looking for it ever since.It rates up there with Cabin in The Sky Stormy Weather and Carmen Jones as a must see in movies that showcased the awesome talent of African Americans.In the 60s the local Los Angeles TV stations would have a movie of the week and some stations would show the same movie for 5 days.Porgy and Bess was one of them and my whole family would be there all 5 nights in front of the TV and only moved on the commercials.South PacificOklahoma and The Sound of Music are all musical classics that you can pick up at any video store.

'This movie is a farce! Names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast. And they have the gall to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon/crossbow weapon. Beowulf doesnt need a weapon like that! In the poem he rips off Grendels arm with his bare hands! And I cant believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing. The way Grendel is portrayed is impressive however. That and the cast are the only positive points of the feature. My English teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination. Unless you are a die-hard fan of the epic poem Beowulf avoid this film at all costs. And even then I wouldnt recommend it.',neg

Tall blond and handsome William Marshall (usually cast in musicals) hunts down the killer as the complex and increasingly creepy plot unfolds against the swankiest settings youll ever see in a film noir. The ending is as much of a surprise as is this sadly forgotten classy murder mystery. Well-worth restoring and reviving on cable-TV VHS or DVD. Republic sank a hefty budget in this Grade-A production and Murder in the Music Hall is as slick unnerving and immensely enjoyable as any of the major studios films of its era. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Pay attention to the rhapsodic song composed by the victim just before his death. Then amidst the showgirls incessant chattering in their dressing rooms try to pinpoint the one humming that fatal melody. Youll discover who the killer is just as William Marshall does. Grand fun the kind of movie they truly dont make anymore and what a loss--both to movie-goers and actors alike.',pos
'This is a badly made poor remake of Bimaldas classic Parineeta. The story is based on Sarat Chandras book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. Well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity. The acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham. Shekars fathers choice of words in abusing Lolita ( Balan ) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again the scene where Shekhar ( Saif ) slaps Lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters is quite jarring to the senses and could have been easily avoided. Similarly the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its spirit the work falls apart. The song piyu bole is quite OK. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where Saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. On these counts this movie deserves 3 stars. The song and dance by Rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on. The song is tuneful but I remember having heard it somewhere before and if Iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized. <br /><br />Well agreed the times have changed from then to now. But then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times.<br /><br />This is what happens when the modern Bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the NRIs and grabbing the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such movies end up neither belonging to India nor to any other part of the world.',neg
'Generally I like something light and fun so this film shouldnt have appealed to me. But it grabbed me from the start. The story of a familys choices and challenges seem obvious but it raises the question over and over: What if it was my family? My choice? I cried and laughed when they did because I really felt what the people involved felt. It was in places difficult to watch but more difficult to turn away. The story is true and life is sometimes difficult to watch! It shows what film-makers can do without sex violence or special effects: a good story is a good story all by itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones. Like real life you really dont know whatll happen next or why people do the things that they do!',pos
'This movie was really awful. It was not in the least bit frightening or even startling. I went to see it with a bunch of friends and by the end of the night we were saying The Ruins ruined my night. <br /><br />I would not recommend seeing this movie in theaters renting it or even watching the movie on television by accident.It is an absolute waste of an hour and a half. <br /><br />The plot was nearly non-existent the characters were horribly underdeveloped and they gave no back story whatsoever for anything that was happening and then left it completely open at the end as if preparing for a sequel.',neg
'A Turkish Bath sequence in a film noir located in New York in the 50s that must be a hint at something ! Something that curiously in all the previous comments no one has pointed out  but seems to me essential to the understanding of this movie <br /><br />the Turkish Baths sequence: a back street at night the entrance of a sleazy sauna and Scalise wrapped in a sheet getting his thighs massaged. Steve the masseur is of the young rough boxer ( Beefcake!) type  and another guy a bodyguard? finishes dressing up. Dixon obviously hates what he sees there and gets rough right away. We know he has a reputation for roughing up suspects. Good cop but getting out of control easy. Why is it that he hates them so much ? <br /><br />Could it be that he hates himself. This part of himself he inherited from his father ? That dark side that could lead him right at the end of the sidewalk into the gutter ? What if that dark side lurked within a closet ? Remember : whenever Dixon meets Scalise ( 3 times) the guy is lying on a bed and he only has men around him for company ( the irony of the  Girls poster pinned up on the wall near his bed !).<br /><br />Scalise acts funny: affected manners cranking his neck arrogantly defiant shoving his inhalator ( poppers ?) into his nostrils each time he talks to Dixon. Dixon with a vengeance is bent on pinning down Scalise who seems not to understand : I never saw a man so full of hate as you. I consider it almost humorous the way you came after me alone.  Four years jumping at me as if I was somebody special! Why? <br /><br />Because Scalise is someone special indeed : he is the direct inheritor of Dixons father :  Your father liked me Your father set me up in business. He stands as Dixons criminal brother his dark side incarnate. And to top it all he prefers the company of men. Dixon knows it well : Who killed him (Paine)? You or one of your playmates? Playmates ! Notice how each time they meet Dixon manhandles Scalise: he picks the address-book out of his jacket slaps his face punches him. Scalise : I warn you not to touch me!  . Dixons homophobia is obvious. Or put it different : his unexpressed homosexuality . Dixon aka Dixons kid is the son of a thief. In reaction to this he decided to become a cop a good one but there is something of the criminal in him a dark side: he is a violent copper a murderer a liar. Besides he is not married brings a dizzy blonde to his familiar eat-out place every now and then but nothing else. The waitress scoffing says that he doesnt know how to make love to a woman. Dixon has a deep feeling of guilt and hates himself for those reasons. A hood and a mobster like his old man. Blood will tell. Finally in order to achieve redemption Dixon decides to sacrifice himself : if he gets his alter ego Scalise to kill him he will free himself from the guilt and free the girl and her father too.<br /><br />The end of the movie brings us back to the opening sequence : Scalise is pushed in the gutter and Dixon deserves the right to walk the sidewalk and wins the love of the dame. He is straight at last.<br /><br />The unspoken theme of the movie could very well be that of a man who in order to cover his repressed feelings wants to experience a womans love ( Jean Douchet)<br /><br />(These notes owe a lot to the film commentary by Jean Douchet in the French DVD edited by CarlottaI',pos
'After the success of the second instalment Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time instead of Tudor times or Elizabethan times Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) is living in the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now stupid but lovable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the faithful butler to George the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series to the wonderfully written sitcom Blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful. He tries electing a lord for a rotten borough tries to sell a book tries to win a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the Prince. This is a very good instalment to the popular comedy. Includes appearances from Robbie Coltrane Tim McInnerny Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry.

'This might not have been as horribly bad as it was if not for the absolutely awful acting job done by Raymond Wallace! This guy is so bad it wasnt even funny!

'Breaker! Breaker! has Chuck Norris as a truck driver and a karate master talk about juggling two disparate careers. He gives a load he cant deliver to his younger brother Michael Augenstein and then when the young man doesnt show up Chuck goes looking for him.<br /><br />What young Augenstein has got himself into is a speed-trap run by Judge George Murdock who comes from the Roy Bean school of jurisprudence. Of course Norris deals with matters in the usual Chuck Norris way and when he gets in trouble the call goes out over the CB for all the truckers to come and help their good buddy. This speed-trap known as Texas City has a bad reputation and the drivers are only too happy to help a pal.<br /><br />Chucks of course quite a bit younger and with no facial hair in this one.

George Murdock is overacting outrageously as the Judge Roy Bean wannabe.<br /><br />This one is strictly for the fans of Chuck Norris.',neg

'**Spoilers contained**<br /><br />Id heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific. What I didnt expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go. What starts off as a typical cowboy/indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic comedy about Honus (Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne. The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit. Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason. They then escape and both turn up (separately) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base. As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them. So far so ordinary. Then comes the ending. After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they/wont they get together storyline the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head. Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and didnt resort to extreme gratuitous violence. In some ways Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perrys Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending. I didnt hate Soldier Blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents I would recommend Elem Klimovs Come and See.',neg
'Never Been Kissed is a real feel good film. If you havent seen it yet then rent it out. I am going to buy it when its released because I loved it. Drew Barrymore is excellent again she plays her part well. I felt I could relate to this film because of the school days I had were just as bad. I thought the plot was well written there was comedy and romance which are the type of films I love. I loved the ending because even though you know whats going to happen it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting - anticipating!!',pos
'Gundam Wing to me happens to be a good anime. A bit slow moving (especially around the middle of the series) but over all enjoyable.

'Where to start with Speck the true story of Richard Speck a killer of eight nurses in the 1960s. Director Keith Walley has worked on a few of the extremely low budget Full Moon Releasing movies (such as Birth Rite) and here works from a script by (at the time) Full Moon regular Don Adams. Unfortunaly whilst the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime the script isnt great perhaps because the real Specks ramblings were not terribly interesting!? Despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic it wreaks of a cheap cash-in of the acclaimed cinematic serial killer movies of the same period (such as Ed Gein). Filmed in a dirty brown not quite sepia for the most part and narrated by star Doug Cole the film fails to present the horror of the crime because the narration is irritating the colouring distracting from the story and the crime though gruesome and upsetting to watch is merely that and no editorial work seems to have occurred on what is pretty much a very poor quality camcorder viewing on the events. There is no examination of the motivation or of Specks life really just a cheap shot at a gruesome crime. Released by Full Moon there is little evidence of Full Moons better output here Charles Band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings (e.g. dolls monsters and so on) and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality. Incidentally Band introduced a special label for these films called Shadow Entertainment. Band has said that he regrets the period of Full Moon output alongside Tempe Entertainment (whose Creator J.R. Bookwalter and regular Danny Draven also speak very badly of Charles Band). The Tempe era features uniform Apple Mac editing and brutal hand-held camera filming very much like a home movie. Speck retains these qualities and whereas Witchouse 3 for example managed to use these well Speck is merely boring and gross.',neg

'First off let me say that this is probably in my opinion one of the 10 most underrated movies since this came out in 72. I absolutely loved this movie its very urban gritty no real Hollywood glam added to it.. you can actually feel for all of the characters in here i love the blood just splattering abound in here. Joe Pesci was pretty good in here but to me it seems like he was definitely outdone by the lead character Joe Cortese now i dont know anything about him  but boy can he really act.. I believe this movie is probably true because living in New Jersey living close to Philly you here this kinda thing all the time. i think that if the movie had a bigger budget  and say Robert deniro as jerrys boss you would have a perfect movie but hey who am i to argue i was so engrossed by this film that it is already up there in my mind with Mean Streets. I wish Hollywood would go back to this urbanized gritty display of movie making: it would serve them very well to do so. this movie is a great drama with great actors in it. and i highly recommend it to anyone.',pos

'This show is actually pretty good. Like all shows on TV it has its good episodes and its bad ones.<br /><br />I have read where people compare this show to Married with Children and I suppose it is a similar show for the new generation. However because of what was expected and allowed on TV in the days of Married with Children that show was taken to great extremes to show that it was in fact a television show and not meant to be take seriously.<br /><br />The War at Home has the luxury of being a bit more realistic. The parents talk to each other like real life parents often do telling their children one thing when they will turn around and do the opposite.<br /><br />Sure some of the content can be considered controversial. But I find this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not there are a lot of families out there just like this one.<br /><br />Every episode does teach a valuable lesson. Its just that sometimes the lesson is that you will not find a perfect solution for every problem that a family may encounter and sometimes the solution is to pick the lesser of two evils. We all know that in some cases as a parent the only goal you can have is to keep your kids out of really big trouble and hope that they learn right from wrong.<br /><br />I respect the writers for attempting to keep the show true to life instead of having some magical ending like the Cleaver family always had.',pos

'About the only thing I liked about this film is that there was JUST enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end... I kept thinking that maybe in the NEXT scene things would gel... Alas...<br /><br />Those who like Gus Van Sants films - especially his later ones - will probably like this. Personally I find van Sants films to be dull pretentious and facile. Well he was an executive producer for this film so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him - although personally I actually liked this better than van Sants latest efforts (e.g. Elephant).<br /><br />Contrary to many here I did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed I thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood - the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world - but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all. But I feel that the problem with the film is that mood is not enough... and not only that but that the mood painted here is to my mind incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening. The dream-like quality so closely linked to nature is beautifully captured here but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold (waves on a beach grasses and flowers spiders etc). The rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when I was about eight or nine. There is a LANGUOR to the film that is in opposition to what SHOULD be a very tense time in an adolescent life. When you are caught up in a crush on someone - or being the object of bullying at school - you are anything BUT languorous! There are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film...SPOILERS HERE - first when Logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit. The frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid - especially with no father present - seemed real to me.<br /><br />The second and ONLY part of the film with any tension to it were the scenes where Leah (Logans re-creation of himself) phones Rodeo and tries to seduce him into phone-sex. The first reason I liked it is because the person who did the voice-over of Leah was the most convincing actor in the entire film. (It made me think of Claire Danes from My So-Called Life ...the voice even sounded like Claire.) She and Rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids. And what I especially liked was the fact that Rodeo only pretended to play along... it was perhaps the best moment in the film as - finally! - we got some character development.<br /><br />All in all a somewhat misplaced effort... we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the directors possible talents. In the meantime if he can get away from van Sants influence it might do him a world of good. Who is this director anyhow - one of van Sants boy toys?',neg

'Warning: mild spoilers.<br /><br />The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing - even moving - episode in American history and World Religious history. This movie portrays events in the life of Joseph Smith whom Mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on the earth. Ive so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing.<br /><br />Joseph Smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin Hyrum & Joseph) who at a very young age needed an operation. The operation done without our modern conveniences was bloody and difficult. The scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents.<br /><br />Josephs religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what Mormons call the First Vision was interestingly portrayed. The face of Jesus is never shown but you see the unmistakable nail marks in His hands. The rejection by religious leaders and many in his small New York community is sweetened at least slightly by Josephs marriage to Emma.<br /><br />This movie does not clearly map out the events of Mormon Church history but merely jumps from scene to scene. This is not a critique - simply a note about the style.<br /><br />The practice of tarring and feathering is shown and it is especially dramatic and moving when Joseph delivers a sermon about the Saviors love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked.<br /><br />The movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of Mormonism as an infant church while at the same time the ever-deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments.<br /><br />The film shows many scenes from Josephs life including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to Emma. An attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of Josephs life including his fierce love for his wife his endless love for children his wit his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition his religious sentiments and his compassion.<br /><br />As Joseph and Hyrum ride to Carthage never to return home alive most of the characters from throughout the movie whose lives had been touched by Joseph are shown along the way helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful.<br /><br />At the end the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is portrayed and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed.<br /><br />When I first watched the movie I assumed it was made by the Church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I no longer think that is the case although I hope the movie can do just that. As an insider I find that the film is a celebration of Joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him. I am curious to see how outsiders will view the film - whether they will simply see it as propagandic an epic story of an American religious man or something else.<br /><br />The film is beautifully shot family friendly moving and hopefully something good for everyone. That the events portrayed actually happened in these United States of America is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law - we moderns take for granted.',pos
'The most misogynistic movie of all time? Not to mention by 68 shouldnt they have moved beyond white people in brown face playing the Indians?

'For those curious this episode is based in theme upon Pirandellos play Six Characters in Search of an Author and Jean-Paul Sartres play No Exit (as indicated most obviously by its title) but of course with a Sterling twist. <br /><br />Five very different individuals find themselves in a round room with no idea who they are other than the indication of their attire. A bell intermittently rings (perhaps also a Hemmingway allusion?) increasing the agony of their incarceration. The newcomer to the group a Major is determined to escape while the others are resigned to their fate. <br /><br />Unlike Pirandello these characters dont even have a story. They have nothing other than the experience of the room in their consciousness and no one to author their nonexistent story so their position is even more hopeless than the characters in Pirandellos piece. Unlike both Pirandello and Sartre there is no relationship involved between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them though the theme of personal responsibility versus apathy is prominent in this story. <br /><br />Though this diverges significantly from the storyline of the authors alluded to in the title themes of Sartre and Pirandello (and many other authors of the twentieth century) come through with absolute clarity. This is very obviously a piece which addresses post-modernist perspective in the context of the Cold War era. There is also an emphasis upon issues of personal insignificance. <br /><br />This is easily one of the best episodes Ive seen and still exceptionally relevant to current experience (as are Sartre and Pirandello).

'Why would anyone want to see this?! If this was a film posted on YouTube by a teenager I might have applauded the teen in doing so much with his mommys video camera. I might have also congratulated his family and friends for doing a good job acting. Sadly it was made by a very experienced film maker and these were apparently professional actors--making this a very very sad film. Sad...and very pathetic actually. As I said it has a definite made directly to video look about it. It also has narration and acting that just scream unprofessionals--how could this be?! The film is filled with lots of corpses and blood. Normally this would turn me off completely as I hate ultra-violent films and dont like seeing all that gore. However given that none of it is that realistic its bearable. However I should warn you that there are a few scenes that are still pretty disturbing. For example the scene with the kid throwing a radio into a ladys tub and watching her naked and frying is pretty bad. There are also scenes where you can hear the thought of psychos as they fantasize about killing women. With a level of misogyny that is pretty awful. the people who wrote this are pretty sick--like killing women is meant to be for our entertainment.<br /><br />After a bunch of senseless murders the film goes to a dining room table--around which are a bunch of goof-balls wearing black hoods WITHOUT eye holes! They are talking with pride about all the murders they have committed and chant. Its all very funny though I am not sure that was the scenes purpose.<br /><br />Then the film talks about various sex crimes and killings and even vampirism and cannibalism. Why I dont know--perhaps because they people made this got off on this sort of crap. And once again you see and hear the thoughts and actions of a creepy German-looking man as he tracks down people and kills them.<br /><br />By the way considering the film used what I must assume are professional actors I wondered why so many people were chosen who were clearly Germans. While they tried to act like Americans and the film was supposed to be in California the accents are STRONG. Perhaps German audiences watched this and marveled at how realistic the acting was but to any American its obvious these folks aint their fellow Americans! Considering that there really WAS a zodiac killer (who was never captured) I do wonder why anyone would want to make a fan film of sorts for the sick menace?! I mean...was this film meant as a snuff film for pervs? I just cant see anyone else wanting to see this or enjoying it. In fact I wonder what would motivate anyone to make such a stupid AND offensive film?! Worthless and deserving to be in IMDbs Bottom 100 list.',neg
'Not even lesser Hitch but simply a bad movie. The cinematic equivalent of a dirty-old-man. Ugly in every way: unimaginative script static point of view putrid clothing ghastly hair unlikable actors and one truly gratuitous rape-and-strangulation scene. The directors perverse sense of humor is present but it is not applied consistently; the movie comes alive only in its cruelty. The women fare especially badly; Frenzy could be used as proof the director was a misogynist though a better explanation to me is that perhaps beginning with his TV series and Psycho- which he himself described as an exercise in thrift an experiment to see if a television crew could shoot a passable feature -Alfred Hitchcock had pretty much abandoned art and settled for commerce. In Frenzy the great master seems to be bowing to convention trying to go with the times and give audiences what he thinks they want- in the form of unappealing nudity nudge-nudge winks and general nastiness. I dont begrudge an old man his rest but I dont want to remember him tired and lazy and pandering- time to watch Vertigo again!',neg
'Last Christmas I was lucky enough to receive one of the 1200 Ultimate Bourne boxed sets from my Better Half but put off watching the final part of the trilogy until yesterday. Given how many recent trilogies have stumbled over the finishing line instead of striding triumphantly through it I was somewhat wary of approaching The Bourne Ultimatum but I really shouldnt have been worried. The electric actions sequences and bruising fight scenes mix effortlessly alongside the intelligent story-lines to make this one of the very best action thrillers I can recall seeing and a sublime end to an excellent series.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) returns after an apparent leak about Operation Blackbriar - a new program based on the old Treadstone project - to the journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) at the Guardian. Determined to uncover more about his half-remembered past Bourne picks up the trail once again but others at the CIA including Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) believe that Bourne himself is the leak and start to pursue the rogue agent with renewed vigour. Can Bourne finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old employers silence him for good? <br /><br />Personally I felt slightly disappointed with The Bourne Supremacy as it ditched the trademark realism of its action scenes and focused on being a proper spy film. Not to say it lost it altogether but compared to the fantastic Bourne Identity it seemed more like a slow-burning spy novel rather than an action-thriller. No such worries here - every car crash punch kick and gun shot is heard and felt with visceral delight but thankfully it still retains a wonderfully intelligent and gripping spy story at its heart to base the action around. It also brilliantly ties together the two earlier films providing a suitable bookend to the trilogy as things are explained and expanded until the full picture is exposed. Performances throughout are nearly faultless - even Julia Styles begins to offer something more than book-wormy eye-candy. The only real downer is that this like the other Bourne films has little to do with the original novel but unless youre a die-hard Ludlum fan this isnt really any real reason to dislike a movie like this of the very highest calibre.<br /><br />Nothing pleases me more than a movie that takes me pleasantly by surprise and despite my fears The Bourne Ultimtum is a cracking movie filled with enough bone-crunching action to satisfy the meat-heads as well as a plot that never threatens to let go of your attention for a single minute. Even at the final reel youre never entirely sure whether a happy ending is assured but whether you are a fan of the series or not (and if not what more do you want?) this is one film you really should track down as soon as you possibly can. No wonder this series forced the producers of the Bond movies to throw out forty-odd years of movie history in order to start again. Bourne is a modern spy hero and made recent Bond films look more like Austin Powers in comparison until Casino Royale gave the Bond series the reboot it desperately needed. Missing out of the Jason Bourne movies is a crime worthy of rendition - go and get yourself a copy of the DVD. Not the Ultimate Bourne collection though - limited edition Im afraid!',pos
'This movie was such a waste of my money. it was disgusting as well as disturbing. honestly i would never recommend this movie to anyone. who thinks of a movie where a girl blows her dog?? seriously... it was a waste of my time. i kept watching the movie hoping it would get better and a plot would emerge but that never happened. id rate the movie an F-. This movie should have been rated R for its disturbing nature. I would never let children of any age see this movie. this movie sucks. this movie is horrible. this movie was a waste of my time. i could have spent the night doing some worth my time instead of renting this movie. this movie was a waste of gas money to get to the store and definitely a waste of two dollars to watch it. pretty much no one should watch this movie. this movie should be banned and burned.',neg
'Okay so I love silly movies. If you enjoy silly sci-fi movies over the top movies or if you are a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell i would go see this movie. This movie is all that i wanted it to be. Being a fan of over the top movies this fit the bill. Every time i thought to myself this movie would be the sillest best movie ever if *blank* would happen.... then just as i thought it *blank* would happen. Its a wonderful silly b-movie. If you are a fan of Campbell id say see it bring your friends laugh at it. Its fun. Its not classic or anything but if its on TV some night watch it. It has become for me a movie i would file under indulgent movies. Movies that may not be good but after a hard day of work i could come home and watch (this list also includes harold and kumar go to white castle army of darkness and  Intolerable Cruelty ) <br /><br />If you feel like a over the top wonderfully slightly bad movie watch this. if not go rent Bubba Ho-tep',pos
'I have never seen the TV Series or the previous movies. Probably thats the reason why I didnt enjoy it much. Boring and just not funny sums it up nicely.<br /><br />Considering the budget the movie seemed to have its embarrassing they couldnt do an even passable job.<br /><br />We went to the cinema with no exceptions at all and the hope to see a somewhat funny movie that wouldnt be too taxing on the mind. My friend fell asleep halfway through the movie and I spend the next 2 hours hoping that it would finally pick up. A hope which died with the end credits.',neg
'Such a masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films was the sequel to The Man From Snowy River is everything that a follow-up should be. It does not tread on the toes of its predecessor preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality.<br /><br />The Man From Snowy River II is based upon the return of Jim Craig to the Snowy River country after a three year absence. The film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century of Australian history legend and horses. The storyline demonstrates a touch of Hollywood in lighter shades an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is far more vibrant than the first film and much more showy with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film yet The Man From Snowy River II possesses every essential characteristic of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography a stunning focus of the Australian high country the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland which equals the first in every way. Geoff Burrowes has done a superb job with this film and it is highly worthy of recognition especially with regard to the quality of the Australian Film Industry. The lead cast from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton and a well-replaced Brian Dennehy carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film. As far as sequels can go The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again.',pos
'The Plainsman represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. It sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper) Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison) Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur) George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. The film is an attempt to buttress Custers last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. Truly this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment but a pretty campy relic by todays standards.<br /><br />TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film this is a moderately appealing transfer with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. Theres a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. All in all the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Forget it. Its Universal! BOTTOM LINE: As pseudo-history painted on celluloid this western is compelling and fun. Just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!',pos
'First off this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the Sci-Fi Channel has produced; that isnt to say that Grendel is a good film in fact it is very bad but it definitely had potential to be a lot better. The flaws of the film come from character design character absurd additions to the story the visual effects the music and for the most part: the acting.<br /><br />When speaking of character design I of course mean the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem like ridiculous Vikings rather than warriors of brute strength -- that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly. Grendel looks like the Hulk but with strange tentacle-attachments to his elbows.<br /><br />The characters are very limited. Beowulf is same from beginning to end however Finn -- a useless sidekick -- achieved some two-dimensionality due thanks to his romantic subplot and Unferth gets some notion as well as he becomes less conceited.<br /><br />Much like Finn there are useless additions to this story to make it its own while still holding to the source material. The crossbow that is gifted to Beowulf is so ridiculous Im surprised the cast didnt walk off the set. Besides additions theres omissions such as the underlying themes of Christianity and Paganism as well as the consequences of lying.<br /><br />The special effects are mighty terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly conceived and as such theyre portrayal on screen is less than believable.<br /><br />The music is overbearing especially when a character dies.<br /><br />All in all this is not Sci-Fis worst film to date. No. It is actually one of the better films though trash it still it is it is good trash making it a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue which is still wooden here and there.<br /><br />I highly recommend you skip this film and watch Robert Zemeckis take on the ancient story of Beowulf simply because this film (Grendel) is only half the tale and not the whole thing which garners this movie a three-star review.',neg
'For those with little time on their hands Ill sum it up quickly in one word...pathetic. There are a lot of good examples as to why this movie fits perfectly under that description. So much so that you can barely go through 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and pointless forced upon you. Want a fully naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason she appears is so pointless though that it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of juvenile crap. You can almost glimpse into the deluded minds of the 12 year old boys that wrote this piece of garbage just by watching this crap that they expect the public to actually pay for!!??!!! <br /><br />Ive watched many a movie franchise decline over the years but American Pie;Beta House has to be one of the worst offenders when you consider that despite the average nature of the original movie its still a thousand times funnier than this dreck.<br /><br />The plot is predictable and sometimes you actually feel like youre watching a school play. The things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually watch it (were talking Star Wars levels of suspension like the kind you need to convince yourself Jar Jar is real)<br /><br />The plot is paper thin and mostly the events that transpire are only there to show another pair of breasts or set up yet another pathetic joke. There is no acting talent to speak of all you get is a bunch of pretty boys trying to make us laugh. And ohhh how they fail!!!! Every gag falls flat and the only thing I laughed at was how socially unaware the scriptwriters appear to be. How else can you explain the bulls**t they try to pass off as a story?<br /><br />They pass up every opportunity to do something worthwhile and entertaining in favour of badly written lowest common denominator nonsense. The characters have to complete a set number of tasks before they are accepted as members of Beta House but this is dealt with mostly by a series of very brief montages that imply that they are completing the tasks but we see little to no evidence of it actually happening. Its a very lazy way of telling a story. It also misses opportunities to be funny in doing so.(Imagine say The Wizard of Oz where all the important events happened offscreen instead of on it and all we see is Dorothy high-fiving the Scarecrow every now and again and saying Gee that sure was a great adventure we just had back then) Lazy. Lazy. LAZY!!!!<br /><br />The female characters have little or nothing to say. All they do is get naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual props through most of the movie. You braindeads that only seek T&A will not be disappointed but for that reason alone shame on you. If you buy this on DVD you will be contributing to the downfall of society in your own special way. Congratulations.',neg
'Not only do I think this was the best film of 1987 its probably in my own amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best films Ive ever seen. For whatever reason I really connected with this movie and it is one of the most personal films I had seen at that point in my life (I was 26). For better or worse I strongly identified with the Holly Hunter character (and Im a guy!). She plays an extremely bright loyal and intense woman who couldnt figure out romantic relationships. There were so many things that she said in this movie that were things that I would say or have said to others in similar circumstances. And the ending of the movie I find to be so very very sad.<br /><br />Obviously this role was the big break for Holly Hunter. Clearly I was not the only one to think so highly of it.',pos
'Sorry guys Ive already written my opinion of this movie but today was the first day I looked at some of the other reviews. There are a quite a lot of people who agree with me but whats scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie. I dont like to write nasty reviews or criticise other peoples opinions but I think its only fair to warn anybody out there who may be debating whether or not to see this movie. This is not a good movie. I really like movies and Ill watch just about anything but this movie made it onto the incredibly short list of movies I watched and was happy to leave halfway through. If you really are incredibly tempted watch the trailer...thats the mistake I made because the entire movie is essentially in the trailer...after that there are no surprises just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias and would hate to criticise him but I think its my duty to stop other people wasting hours of their life on a movie like this!!',neg
'This movie about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great!<br /><br />It isnt an idealistic movie I would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place.

Great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time but that you can find happiness with fire and passion as the main character Gigi would say.',pos
'These are excerpts from a nine-page Memo to Mr. Cohn from Mr. Welles written after Orson had seen studio mogul Harry Cohns edited version of the picture (he took an hour out): <br /><br />...The preview title music was written by a first rate composer George Antheil. Although not written for our picture at all this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable...The only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer (Heinz Roemheld) is the rather weary one of using a popular song--the theme--in as many arrangements as possible. Throughout we have musical references to Please Dont Kiss Me for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material. The tune is pleasing it may do very well on the Hit Parade--but Lady from Shanghai is not a musical comedy...Mr. Roemheld is an ardent devotee of an old-fashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as Disney. In other words if somebody falls down he makes a falling down sound in the orchestra etc. etc...If the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative I couldnt be unhappier about the results...Just before I left to go abroad I asked Vi (Viola Lawrence the editor) to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi-cab and also quite a bit of dialogue. I am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut...saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence (this was not done accounting for the main weaknesses of the films opening reel)...There is nothing in the fact of Ritas diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo...What does matter is Ritas beauty...the evil overtones suggested by Grigsbys character and Michaels bewilderment. Any or all of these items might have inspired the music. Instead the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a Silly Symphony: a pratfall by Pluto the Pup or a wild jump into space by Donald Duck...There is no sound atmosphere on the boat. A little wind and water is sorely missed. Theres no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen...At the start of the picnic sequence...in the temporary score we used a very curious sexy Latin-American strain...This has been replaced with a corny dramatic sequel--bad stock stuff...This sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved Lady from Shanghai from being just another whodunit...There is a big musical outburst after Grigsbys line I want you to kill him. This is absurd...The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio...was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point. As it stands now its on about the same level as the rest of the scoring. Nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that were kidding...The aquarium scene needs more echo. Please Dont Kiss Me is in again!...A bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of Michaels run down the pier. From the gunshot through to the phone call a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort. For some reason this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo. As a result the whole sequence seems dull...The audience should feel at this point along with Michael that maybe they are going crazy. The new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe theyre going to sleep...The gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music...The closing music again makes reference to Please Dont Kiss Me...This finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picture.<br /><br />All of these edits from Orson were ignored',pos
'INSPECTOR GADGET (1999) **<br /><br />Starring: Matthew Broderick Rupert Everett Joely Fisher Andy Dick Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes Rated PG<br /><br />By Blake French:<br /><br />Disneys new film Inspector Gadget is about a cop named John who survives a major accident and is saved by a state of the art experimental operation that turns him into a robotic machine-like agent who has tools and contraptions of all sorts built into his body at his use when he says Go Go only to be called Inspector Gadget!<br /><br />The actual movies structure is much like the body formation of Inspector Gadget himself. It is noisy fragmented energetic and consist of a bunch of half hearted contraptions thrown together to make something that doesnt have much in common with anything else present. The film is basically a series of zany action sequences that are kind of pasted together with characters and an uneven story that only kids between the ages of 6-9 would enjoy.<br /><br />The cop who is dramatically reinvented is played by Matthew Broderick who until Inspector Gadget was on a success spree with movies like Election. His character becomes Inspector Gadget after an encounter with the films heavy handed villain named Claw. He is played by Rupert Everett who has already experienced catastrophe this year with the dreadful William Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream.<br /><br />There is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as ample amounts of scenes involving Inspector Gadgets wacky body parts and mechanism elements. It has Gadget and Claw drooling over the attractive character Brenda played by Joely Fisher for both her looks and her knowledge of a specific invention made by her late father who was earlier killed by Claw. Competition evolves into fight scenes and a reason for many happenings in the film. Also a major character is the Gadget Mobil a life like automobile that is devised for Inspector Gadget himself. It is voiced by D.L. Hughly from the sitcom comedy The Hughlys.<br /><br />Inspector Gadget is a movie that I found quite bad. I know I am not exactly a target audience of the filmmakers but even my ten year old relative found the film to his disliking. The movie is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems. I never found myself caring about the characters. There is no mood development beyond some neat opening credits unlike the much worse 1997 film Mr. Magoo which opened using clips of the original cartoon. Is it too much to ask for that same type of thing in this comedy-which is seldom funny and hardly ever convincing. The overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete sight gags and consists of one joke: Inspector Gadgets bumbling goofiness.<br /><br />In movies like this the audience lusts for boundaries-something to help make out what can happen and what can not. In Inspector Gadget there are no such boundaries. This is truthfully nothing more than a party time for the actors who surly had lots of fun. I am reminded of another lacking comedy released a few years ago called Blankman which again contained lots of props and energy and the actors certainly had fun time with all the gizmos and props but it too lacked something needed for every movie: audience participation.<br /><br />A character that I found being left out a lot is Gadgets daughter who by the end of the movie I still has not clue of what her name was. She is used only as a plot device-and I question how she was used to further the plot as well. For her presence brings nothing relevant or productive to the film. We never know her reactions to her fathers operation or accidents. Thus this is someone who could have been completely left out and would have not affected the movie a bit.<br /><br />In closing Id like to state that Inspector Gadget is an awful insufficient excuse for a childrens comedy. And believe it or not I find myself comparing this film to last years violent and very anti-young audience action picture Blade. I am stating once again that I had much rather have a movie where nothing happens than one in which everything happens. Inspector Gadget had so much going for it at the same time it made literally made me dizzy.<br /><br />',neg
'Clearly rips off Hideo Nakatas Ringu (Ring 1998) and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water 2002) with hints of Ju-On (The Grudge 2000) but atrociously done gore (a green corpse with red eyes!?) weak story and a weak theme (I find it very difficult to find a picture message scary). There were two moments in this film that made me shudder both involving an unexpected hand and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi one this one from 1999) had me tingling all over for hours after seeing it and all of the films this steals from were actually scary I cant see this film as anything other than a sell-out to the western popularity of the big Japanese horror films.

But Rififi isnt just this one scene - every scene in the film is as masterfully put together and as a whole the film is not only taught with suspense plot and character but an adroitly told moral tale that set the scene for film noire for years to come.<br /><br />Cinematically and technically the heist sequence may be the most impressive scene of the film but for me its the final scene that holds the most power - Tony le Stéphanoiss hallucinogenic drive towards redemption.',pos
'Roegs take on Conrads Heart of Darkness was not quite what I had expected. Although based on one of historys most studied and interesting texts the film just became sort of dull. The story just never manages to grasp the viewer. It just comes across as indifferent in a way.<br /><br />The traces of the text are easily spotted but still this is not really Conrads Heart of Darkness. Benedict Fitzgeralds (who also wrote The Passion of the Christ) script just uses Conrad as an inspiration and thus becomes Fitzgeralds Heart of Darkness. The film is just not worth it unless you are particularly interested in Conrad or perhaps John Malkovich.',neg
'- A film crew is shooting a horror movie in an old supposedly cursed house where over the years seven people have mysteriously died. One of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie. It is reasoned that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using. But as the book is read the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life. Now the cast and crew are faced with real danger .<br /><br />- IMDb lists a running time of 90 minutes. For the first 60 of those minutes nothing happens. Far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie. Are we supposed to be frightened by the horror movie that they are shooting? We already know that their movie isnt real. These scares just dont work.<br /><br />- There are very few things to enjoy about The House of Seven Corpses. The acting is atrocious. Most of these actors would have trouble making a elementary school play. The score is terrible. It is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere other than a few moments at the end of the movie there is none to speak of. Character logic is all but non-existent. Even in a movie you expect characters to behave in a certain way. Here I dont think I remember one scene where a character didnt choose the most illogical avenue available to them. And finally theres those first 60 minutes of the movie that Ive already mentioned. Can you say BORING? <br /><br />- I havent rated The House of Seven Corpses any lower because of instances where the movie (probably by accident) actually works. My two favorite are the beginning and ending. The opening title sequence presents the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie. And the ending scenes on the massive staircase as the zombie menaces the film crew are somewhat effective (what a ringing endorsement). Overall though these moments arent enough to make this a good movie.',neg

'To finally see what many consider to be the greatest women-in-prison film of all time I felt like I had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds. Boy it sure contained the elements I expected and delivered so much more. A constant Im discovering in these films is the toughness and grit of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their threshold tolerance and resolve(..not to mention sanity)being tested by their superiors. While most of them were hired for the way they look naked because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements something else emerges other attributes such as attitude and guts that I ultimately respond to.<br /><br />This as you may know all too well was Demmes debut for his mentor Roger Corman and he provides the target audience with exactly what they desire while putting his own stamp on the proceedings. For instance there are bizarre dreams certain characters have which define their current psychological states(..theres a particular number featuring warden Barbara Steele where she reminded me of Alex de Large of A Clockwork Orange).<br /><br />The film has female prisoners planning a daring escape tired of the crazed antics of their wheel-chair bound warden and her nutty prison doc Randolph(Warren Miller). Juanita Brown is Maggie the tough sassy sister who is fed up with the environment and will do whatever it takes to get out. Shes the one all the girls fear to cross. Erica Gavin is Jacqueline Wilson the newest prisoner who was busted by police and sentenced for the murder of a cop unwilling to give up the names of those she was involved with. Roberta Collins is Belle a serial kleptomaniac best pals with Pandora(Ella Reid). Belle becomes the obsession of Randolph who promises Superintendent McQueen(Steele)that through a surgical procedure he can remove her violent tendencies. Drugging her up Randolph takes nude pictures and sodomizes her whimpering like a little girl due to his own mental deficiencies while hugging her naked body in his arms. Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith is Lavelle in prison for life for murdering a scumbag whose relative was a Senator. Lavelle receives work in Randolphs office and is the one responsible for relating his dirty antics to Pandora. Demme effectively builds the movie to the expected finale as a planned break-out using those behind the various traumas inflicted on the prisoners as hostages with gunfire erupting.<br /><br />I was quite impressed with the photographic work of long time Demme collaborator cinematographer Tak Fujimoto as he is able to establish some visually arresting moments within the cramped confines of the prison cells and rooms not an easy task. The prison is appropriately crummy and the girls despite being quite attractive look the part of desperate inmates longing yearning from the very pits of their souls to escape such horrid entrapment. Steele is superb as the warden understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far candidly able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint..notice how she works her glasses and settles herself without blowing her top particularly when certain behaviors she has contempt for push her teetering to the edge. Cales bluesy score is incredibly depressing while also casting a wink to the audience that the movie is still fun-and-games..I think Cales score mirrors Demmes handling of the material. Cale and Demmes partnership is an uncanny alliance that presents the setting as a sad isolating oppressive place while almost simultaneously showcasing a humorous tone that permeates due to the colorful characters thanks in part to the personalities of the cast. My favorite scene happens outside the prison as two of our girls(..joining forces with a third)interrupt a bank robbery already in progress..the kicker is it was a bank they were planning to rob! As you might expect you get naked women in showers prisoner in solitary a cat fight shootouts attempted escapes which go awry and other exploitative elements(..such as a horrifying shock therapy session not to exclude the shocking aforementioned sequence where the screwy doc takes advantage of Belle). Interesting enough Demme relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making.',pos
'THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits (an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music) but sadly the movie is all downhill from there. A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion... admonishing his servants and friends that the new Mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past. Well in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband assures her that its all merely in her mind and... well you can probably see where this all is going. You will have figured out whats going on long before our hapless heroine... because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and done better too). To add to the movies myriad transgressions most cuts of this movie (on numerous cheap DVD compilations) seem to be missing a few key scenes. You see the heroine slowly walking towards the window... she goes to open it... you know she is going to see something scary... and then... suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husbands arms. So what did she see??? I guess well never know.',neg
'Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was even 10\% as deranged as the one in this film well then I guess he could have turned out worse. Unfortunately the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the pictures box office appeal. Several times during the film Milligans ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends and suddenly good-looking stand-ins for Milligans homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60s guitar rock. Its pretty easy to fast-forward through if youre trying to pay attention to Milligans original film which unfortunately is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes. What remains however is still compelling stuff. I dont think Ive ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before.',pos
'The best that I can say about this film is that it was mildly amusing at times and that it was an adequate time killer. Unfortunately this film is also so annoying that I wanted to slap these characters around. This is the kind of film that is so sweet it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good I suppose but things get awfully tiresome when the dialogue is SO nauseating. When the two leads arent together on-screen this really isnt bad at all but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to one another.',neg
'This was a highly original decent movie and a brave move for all those involved. I dont care if its not the most well put-together movie of all time the fact that it has Eddie Murphy doing something non-formulaic and that I dont know what will happen next makes it a favorite of mine. I wish more movies were as imaginative as this one rather than the same old formula for entertainment.',pos
'One of Chaplins longest films up to that point Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then Prosper Merimees well-known story about Carmen. I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDbs listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer and from what Ive read those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes. <br /><br />From the very beginning its clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplins most complex and ambitious efforts to date starting off with a long back story told through inter-titles about the tragic love story of Carmen. <br /><br />Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies (A band who put the GYP in gypsy.) to seduce a Spanish officer so they can pull off their smuggling operation. Its a clever Chaplinesque band of criminals the leader of whom Lillas Pastia has spent 50 years learning to steal thinking he might be offered a job in politics. <br /><br />On a side note Ive seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplins earlier work but probably none quite as overt as in this one. Near the beginning of the movie as the band of gypsies are traveling there is a scene where the mules and women are loading and an inter-title explains that the mules are the ones with long ears. In case you couldnt tell I guess. <br /><br />Chaplin plays the part of Don Jose the hapless officer who is to be seduced by Carmen. He is described as a brave soldier and lover of women. Not exactly a stretch for Chaplin who removed any doubt about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant Shoulder Arms. And of course he didnt have to act about being a lover of women.<br /><br />What is different here of course is his polished military uniform and straight-backed disciplinary manner interspersed of course with some of his traditional slap-stick moves. He strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a gruff stolid exterior.<br /><br />Soon Carmen enters (Loved by all men under the age of 96) and she immediately begins flirting with Charlie. I should mention that for a good majority of the movie it is surprisingly faithful to the original story which was full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover able to evoke a jealous passion that Ive never seen from him. Theres at least one scene where he is genuinely a little scary. <br /><br />Chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end. And his boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasnt very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on probably about five times longer than it was worth. Although it was interesting that when it finally fell over it clearly was revealed as a movie prop. I always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie sets.<br /><br />The end of the film is its strongest part. It bears striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet but just when you think that Chaplin is going to conduct a major thematic experiment by diverging distantly from his traditional style there is a hilarious twist that is as vintage Chaplin as anything Ive ever seen. Nice work!',pos
'its the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! im happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and im glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too but Logan is best. i would like Lorelai to remain with Christopher because he is beautiful. this show is good for all ages and is worth to be seen. i really want the DVDs but i think that here in Romania will never appear because i think that they dont even know that they have fans here. but no matter what ill be watching it. bye!!',pos
'This was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects.

'This is an excellent modern-day film noir....excellent in that its interesting start-to-finish. There are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief.....but I havent found anyone who didnt get caught up in this story. The movie has the right amount of action suspense plot twists and interesting characters. In addition it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar-based soundtrack. <br /><br />I labeled this crime movie a film noir because its gritty and the all the characters are no good. Even the only supposed-good guy played by Nicholas Cage gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he shouldt have. He also does something at the end which isnt right but Im not going the spoil it by saying. Suffice to say however that the rest of the characters are so bad they make Cage look good!<br /><br />Speaking of bad guys does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the deranged category hes tough to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons. J.T. Walsh gives another great supporting performance too.<br /><br />This is one of those films that never got much publicity but it should have. Youll have fun watching this. By the way try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up!',pos
'I got to see this on the plane to NZ last week and was wondering how it would measure up to both the UK film and the book. I have to say I was favorable impressed. If anything the fanatical attachment to the Red Sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC who have had success through the years. As a Brit I was also interested to see that you dont need to understand baseball to get whats going on. One question springs to mind - Was the screenplay written using the Sox as the team even before they finally broke the Curse of the Bambino? Or was another team in the frame? As a Red Sox fan myself (weird I know a Brit who understands baseball) I have to say that it added to the enjoyment.',pos
'Salva and his pal Bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives. We see them panhandling in a car of the underground where their pitch to get donations is so lame no one gives them anything! Salva who is a hardened petty criminal doesnt even have any redeeming qualities that is until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next. Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination something that Salva capitalizes on.<br /><br />He and Bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo. Salva shows he is a natural for the reality show. He transforms himself into a Christ-like figure who is an instant success in the program. Espe who is a no-nonsense woman who is shows producer cant escape from the way Salva pays her unusual attention. Ultimately Salva is the victim of his own success in the end.<br /><br />Jordi Molla whose first directorial job this movie is had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television. Spain which was vulnerable to these types of programs has seen its share of the bizarre which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience.<br /><br />The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film. Mr. Molla like any actor who decides to direct his first feature would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera. Candela Pena a good actress is one of the best reasons for watching the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo David Gimenez Cacho Franco Francescoantonio Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.',pos
'An old high school teacher of mine used to brag that hed seen every movie EVER made so one day a friend of mine and I decided to make up a movie called Pacific Inferno. Later we got into an argument whether the lead role was played by Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams. Our teacher found the argument interesting so he came up to us and informed us that the lead role in Pacific Inferno was played by Jim Brown. We thought he was trapped in a lie that was until we went to the library and discovered that Pacific Inferno was in fact a real movie. This incident forced me to rent the movie... its horrible. Our made up movie had a better plot than this piece. Weathers and Billy Dee would have been much better in the picture.',neg
'The story itself is routine: A boy runs away from home and ends up in a struggling music school for kids. He convinces a famous violinist to sponsor the school. The film is a splicing of shootings over 11 weeks and leaves many amusing holes which the observant viewer may find for him/herself.<br /><br />However long the whiskers of the plot might have been the movie is justified by its music and acting. There is plenty of music featuring classical works played by Heifetz and by The Meremblum Orchestra one of the leading youth symphonies of that day and said music is excellent. By itself it would make the picture worth viewing. The conducting and scoring duties were put in the best of hands: those of Alfred Neumann.<br /><br />The acting is a study in contrasts. The kids in the orchestra most of whom had little or no acting experience must have driven director Archie Mayo crazy looking into the camera overacting the parts that they had and overstudiously following directions given to them. But the spontaneity that results from their lack of training adds an interesting charm to the picture. The veteran actors were marvelous with the material they had to work with. Walter Brennan was perfectly cast in his role one that he emulated in real life. Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds were ideal fits for their parts. And the supporting acting was a veritable Whos Who of character actors: Marjorie Main Arthur Hohl Paul Harvey  Charles Coleman Perry Ivins and Porter Hall in his typical role of the heavy---all ideally cast. And the bit players: Jessie Arnold John Hamilton Marjorie Wood Jimmy Flavin Dulcie Day the gravelly voiced Lee Phelps in his usual role as a policeman and many many more. If youre a fan of character actors this movie will bring back a lot of memories.<br /><br />Overall the picture is very enjoyable and is recommended even if you arent a fan of classical music.<br /><br />tvcat',pos
'I saw that movie and i was shocked! Robert Carlyle isnt Hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be Hitler. The Movie lies it doesnt reflect the truth. In the scene were Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler never had hit anybody he wouldnt hit people with his fist but with the fists of soldiers. Understand?? Another thing is: It is too obvious that Hitler is that evil he was more clever than shown in this movie. No German would have accepted him as the leader because the can see that he is evil. So the real Hitler havent shown his evil side to the people.<br /><br />Have any of you Yankees watched the movie Der Untergang or The Dawnfall? this is a great movie with amazing actors. And its a German movie. I think this Theme of Nazi-Germany should not be realized as a movie by people who dont know anything of Germany. People! Watch Der Untergang: <br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/<br /><br />Its a great movie about a very sad period of time for human beings around the world.',neg
'On the 1998 summer blockbuster hit BASEketball (1998): This is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo-tron screen in a sports bar during the day - when everyone is quite drunk. Unfortunately I was sober when I saw this movie.<br /><br />So quoted the late Gene Siskel for this lame-brained supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior Theres Something About Mary in a one-upmanship game during July of 1998. Mary was a gross-out fest but in addition to the many gags it had a lot of heart which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer.<br /><br />BASEketball tried to outdo Mary but it fizzled in more ways that one. You take the creators of South Park Trey Parker and Matt Stone who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera the only member of ZAZ David Zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck and the other two Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture a small bit by now 90 years young Ernest Borgnine wasting his precious time in his distinguished career dying on a hotdog and singing Im Too Sexy as he videotapes his will Jenny McCarthy who has little screen time as Borgnines not-too-weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter a bigger female part by Yasmine Bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey Robert Vaughn as a corrupt archrival and pointless cameos by Airplane! alumni Kareem Abdul Jabaar and the late Robert Stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and its much fresher humor created by the ZAZ family. What do all these people make up? A desperate cast and crew trying to replicate Airplane! humor and mixing it up with the crudity of South Park but failing in every way.<br /><br />To make this long 100-minute movie short BASEketball a real game invented by David Zucker and his friends in his hometown of Milwaukee is about two lazy losers (Parker and Stone) and their pint-sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball (hence the title) together on the driveway of ones house. After Borgnine dies he bequeaths the ownership of his BASEketball team the Milwaukee Beers to Parker and Stone. Sure enough the game goes national and archrivals Vaughn and McCarthy want to take away ownership of the Beers team from them. But Bleeth is in love with both men particularly Parker and one poor sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga-ga over them. Those are the characters not strongly developed.<br /><br />Now witless gags ensue. Blood electroshock hair egg-throwing and screaming are among them. Parker and Stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital but he pulls through the liver transplant. Borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will. McCarthy who seemed to get over Borgnines death by choking on a frank right away quickly massages Vaughn in the next scene. Cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits. There is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing. And David Zucker forces the parodies of Riverdance and Titanic. Parody forcing is nothing new to ZAZ post Airplane! and The Naked Gun series.<br /><br />And like Siskel I was sober as well but I was also getting sleepy. This movie should be played over and over to coarse-mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers but will they remain alert and awake or pass out during the unfunny parts? If they pass out then they wont realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity. Hats off to them!',neg
'Lifeforce starts in outer space where the HMS Churchill tracks Haleys Comet & its equipment detects a 150 mile long alien spaceship in the head of the comet unable to contact Earth because of interference Colonel Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) decides this is the one & only chance to investigate it. Going outside in spacesuits Carlsen & some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship & find the remains of a bat like race of creatures & three perfect looking humanoids two men (Chris Jagger & Bill Malin) & a beautiful woman (Mathilda May) all of whom they take aboard the Churchill. Thirty days later & back on Earth the Churchill is detected on radar a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out & all the crew supposedly dead. The rescue team do find the three humanoid aliens though & take them back to Earth where in a space research center in London they come back to life & start to literally suck the lifeforce out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust things look grim as the epidemic spreads throughout London...<br /><br />This English production was produced by the notorious Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus who during the early 80s were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company Cannon usually starring Chuck Norris & they wanted to move into the big time & signed director Tobe Hooper up on a three film deal (which were this Lifeforce the Invaders from Mars (1986) remake & The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) a sequel to Hoopers own classic) all of which flopped & basically bankrupt both Golan & Globus & Cannon was no more. Anyway despite being a commercial flop at the box-office I have to say I think Lifeforce is a highly enjoyable if rather silly sci-fi horror. When originally released into theatres back in 85 Lifefore was cut down to 101 minutes by Golan & Globus but over the past few years the longer 116 minute cut has all but replaced it on DVD VHS Laserdisc & TV although apparently Hoopers original cut of the film ran for 128 minutes so theres even more footage out there somewhere. I will be basing my comments on the longer 116 minute cut the script by Dan OBannon Don Jakoby & uncredited rewrites by Michael Armstrong & Olaf Pooley was based on the 1976 novel The Space Vampires by Colin Wilson & has many extraordinary ideas its scope is truly ambitious & one felt that it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of an entertaining one. It moves along like a rocket & at heart theres a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into a tangle. There are also some hilarious moments in Lifeforce the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female Vampire to surrender by offering her a half eaten biscuit is a true camp classic the horribly overwrought hypnosis scenes including the one where Railsback ends up kissing Patrick Stewart & many many more besides. I dont know call me weird but I just thought Lifeforce was tremendous fun & highly entertaining in just about every way from silly characters odd dialogue strange ideas that never quite come together & some terrific visuals Lifeforce certainly isnt a film that will bore you.<br /><br />Director Hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has (double what he had for Poltergeist (1982) even) & he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen John Dykstra the guy responsible for Star Wars (1977) Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) & more recently Spider-Man (2002) was brought in to handle the visual effects & generally speaking they look fabulous. The sequences set in outer space with spaceships in particular look great theres also some really good visual effects back on Earth including the destruction of London as 100s of blue souls fly around everywhere. Theres some nudity but not much gore there are some withered corpses a few gunshot wounds the skin on someones hand peels off blood spurts from someones eyes nose & ears & theres a severed arm as well as some zombies. The special make-up effects are also generally very good. I wouldnt say Lifeforce is scary as such as its more of a sci-fi film than horror I loved the way Hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps rotating his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness & that there is no solid floor as it were.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $25000000 it made less than half that in its theatrical run & hasnt set the world alight on video or DVD either which is a shame because although its a bit of a mess its very enjoyable to watch. Shot on location in England. Well filmed in 2:35:1 widescreen the 4:3 cropped image is horrible & cuts huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes its hard to make out whats going on & the sense of the vastness of space & the alien spaceship is lost. The acting is OK in a very silly film Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gielgud Nancy Paul replaced Olivia Hussey Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski while Anthony Hopkins turned the role of Caine down.<br /><br />Lifeforce is a bizarre film no two ways about it really & anyone looking for something simple & straight forward should look elsewhere. Anyone looking for something a bit different in the sci-fi genre than give Lifeforce a go as its one of those so bad its good films with some impressive effects & it isnt your average run of the mill film by any means.',pos
'I just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and I cant remember a movie where I laughed SO hard -- literal out loud deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious. Granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesnt matter that you know how its going to end. The actors comedic senses of timing were impeccable. The actors were perfectly cast. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who arent ruining their lives. She is so refreshing. My children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006. Our money was well spent on this movie.',pos
'As if there werent enough of those floating around at the time already we have here another lame GODFATHER clone from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) which I had watched earlier this year. The marquee-value name roped in this time is Telly Savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of French painters! Apart from not looking minimally Sicilian he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl. Antonio Sabato then makes for an unlikely gangster - apart from being a resistible leading man; his relationship with Savalas which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye is also unconvincing (especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latters spirited teenage niece)! Besides for a gangster flick theres precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable (though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled); furthermore the score by Francesco De Masi is serviceable but nothing else. Incidentally the bargain-basement DVD I rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members - or even the films title - is ever listed!',neg
'Nice description of the situation in the US it explains different kinds of Islam not just show terrorist and extremist. Islam can be other thing that killing they show why some people become terrorist and how to be Muslim without being extremist. It is a great series that Muslims and no-Muslims should see. Now we hope that other series or films will be done to change the idea of all Muslims are terrorist and all Americans want to destroy Islam. It gave me the interest to discover what Islam is exactly and what the US and also European government do to help cohabitation between people of different religion.',pos
'so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless. i know it got awards and things but i personally did not enjoy it too much. there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs. some of the people in are rather different which isnt a bad thing it just didnt leave a good impression on me. i was thoroughly bored by this movie no offense to my creative writing teacher. the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didnt get it and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing. the green animals thing was neat i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers but how did these four jobs connect? it just didnt make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that. But if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it. who am i to stand in your way. I am just forewarning you about possible suffering.',neg
'Which do you think the average person would know more/less about: Iranian cinema or Iranian football? Interestingly the two come to the forefront of controversial Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahis latest film entitled Offside a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around ones right to do something or go somewhere and an individuals right to extend that courtesy if and when theyd like to. The odd thing is you dont come away from Offside having learnt about Iranian football or too much about Iranian cinema (unless its an education in Panahis controversial style) but you do come away feeling enlightened that at least someone from Iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like Iran and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it.<br /><br />I can remember the 2006 World Cup Im sure many people can. It was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year a summer of World Cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic. Needless to say I saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in Spain 82 when it was thought West Germany and Austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of Algeria.<br /><br />Anyone in Britain that was watching the BBCs broadcast of the Iran  Mexico game both nations first of the tournament may remember that at the top of the show the BBCs football anchorman Gary Lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match. It went something like: Weve seen giants Germany England Argentina and Holland play but now we get to see.........Mexico and Iran battle it out. The emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore. Its a shame because there are people and films like Offside present them who are really willing to see Iran play to the point where they risk their well-being to achieve it and its sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem inferior when there are others whod do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage.<br /><br />When immediately thinking of the words Iran football and World Cup my mind flies back to the France 98 game between said nation and America. Here is a film about a World Cup game of sorts involving Iran but where some or indeed most Iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around Irans famous victory over The United States and what that meant to them director Panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude. You can imagine a heavy handed film detailing Irans victory as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they defeat a Western power or enemy at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in.<br /><br />A couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 Indian film Lagaan in which the Indian peasants defeat the ruling British at cricket. Similalry 2005s The Game of Their Lives sees the Americans defeat the English at a football match only this time in the 1950 World Cup. The differences between these films and Offside are immense; Offside is looking at a situation behind a states mentality and dares to explore an essence of Feminism as the girls trying to see their beloved Iran defeat Bahrain and qualify for the World Cup are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game. The reasoning is to do with the foul language the men may not will but may use during the game. The film presents Iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a mans right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a womans right to see the game all together  it is no wonder Panahis film was itself banned in Iran.<br /><br />But Panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body/mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match. Panahi pays special attention to the title of his film Offside which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an attacker is caught trying to gain an advantage in the field of play. The parallels run with the womens position in the film as these advancing (supposedly without right) individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team; that being the state itself.<br /><br />I think Offside is one of the better films to come out of the Middle East and surrounding Gulf area that Ive seen. Its a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the IMDb and thus the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo-realist aura to it all. The immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong-doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful. I also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons Ive mentioned shows a distinct level of callous either that or you work in the Iranian government.',pos
'I really enjoyed this movie. I have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old Navy guy Im still stirred by the rousing rendition of Anchors Away! I also love the McHales Navy pirate atmosphere. I could have done without the female dive officer but Im just old fashioned I guess. She was still good to look at lol espesially after the crew got done with her laundry. The cook sonarman and electrician made the movie. Loved the salty old engineer and his first class PO too. And Grammer actually did a very commendable job of being a misfit Officer. I loved the driving scene as they passed the golf course on the way into port lol. Pure Navy!

'This movie pops up now and again on the ABC in Australia at about 3 am in the morning.<br /><br />It starts off with the scene of a bus crash in London.<br /><br />The films has got flashbacks of each character as the film progresses plus the lapsed photography of Big Ben winding back to symbolise what events occurred thirteen hours ago up until the bus crash.<br /><br />It took me a while to understand it but it was enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br />If Sean Cunningham and Quentin Tarrantino got together and made a film this may be the result - due to the flashbacks and small stories tying in and deaths.<br /><br />I am unsure of the main characters as it has been a while since I have seen it but a rare gem indeed.',pos

'The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay Ive ever seen. Aside from the acting which is wooden no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows up the middle of roads and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready. The constant suicidal behavior set off my tilt switch so often I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had. This movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in Saving Private Ryan. Unless you are under 7 years old I recommend watching something else.<br /><br />GB',neg
'This is not great cinema. The film is cliche ridden and in many places it is a copy of the original Carrie. The parallels with the original film are striking but with an added improbability about the telekenetic powers being congenital.<br /><br />I cant say that I disliked the film because it at least passed a couple of hours ... but these were passed as one would read an undemanding book on a long train journey. That book would not be great literature but would absorb one for a while and be forgotten soon afterwards in that it would blend in with the numerous other cliche ridden books. Likewise the film was okay whilst it lasted but is perhaps forgettable. At least I think it is. I cant remember much about it now!!',neg
'I was expecting a lot from this movie and I can say I havent been disappointed. First of all this movie as a world tour of wine making let the spectator enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are really interesting and funny too in particular Hubert de Montille. The shooting may be confusing the camera always being unsteady and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds. You may not like it but I dont consider it as a defect.<br /><br />The themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well since globalization isnt the only issue discussed. But Nossiter managed to give his movie a consistency all along. A great achievement of this movie is revealing all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are avoiding a cliché Good against Evil. This could be the main difference between Mondovino and Michael Moores documentaries; Nossiters point of view appears in a subtle way through opinions expressed by his favorite characters. The richness of this documentary relies mainly upon the characters the history of long-time wine-making families such as the De Montilles the Mondavis the Antinori and the Frescobaldi. Nossiter lets the spectator discover that wine is somehow related to families rather than just being a business and an industry. This movie doesnt make you want to drink wine but certainly make you want to discover vineyards and wine-makers.<br /><br />I watched this movie as a student in Enology and lets just there are many ways to learn. I give this documentary 10 out of 10 despite his technical particularities.',pos
'I have been a Star Trek fan for as long as I can remember. When they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series I was very excited.<br /><br />The premiere of Enterprise was well worth the wait. It was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters. The NX-01 Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love.<br /><br />Scott Bakula was just superior as Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave a commanding performance as Subcommander TPol. That it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of Starfleet.<br /><br />Enterprise looks like its going to be a good series well worth watching and I recommend that. Watch it.',pos
'Landscape after a battle opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob and when they (also treated humouristic) burry a man alive the protagonist stops for a moment but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about his neighbour.<br /><br />The rest of the film is set in an American camp from where the prisoners are not released in some kind of semi freedom semi camp. A perfect set for a study of war criminality American camps Polish nationalism Catholisism grief and human misery in general.<br /><br />Film makes an important turn. In comes women and with them film changes light colour and temper. At the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in Holocaust. I think a main underlying political theme of the film must mankinds treatments of Jews under and after the world war and not only the Nazi exterminations but mankind letting it happen - and even forcing them out of Europe after the war. On an emotional level the film is about grief and the problem with letting grief come how environment makes grief difficult and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences. <br /><br />But the film is a carpet of underlying contradictionshumour irony and sudden beauty. A couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on an harp an emotional tune brutally rejected (filmatically speaking) by the protagonist. That example picks up an important essence of the films style and theme. When it comes to humour its very comic how the protagonist constantly looses and finds back his glasses in crowds in hay stacks etc.<br /><br />Its not hard to understand Spielbergs respect of Wajda when you see this film. The great treatment of light can be compared with Spielberg on his best. The Grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. Narrativly it only brings the film out of the camp but filmatically it brings the film to dream and eternity with profound beauty. Anyhow there is also another scene I cant let go without comment. Its the Christian Supper. Undoubtly ironical but simultaneously deeply religious we see the transsubstantiation moment everybody falling on their knees while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic altar boy. His bells are mocking the scene but also gives it emotion and love. When Nina gets her bread sun light falls upon her and bells ring spheric its the peak moment of the film.<br /><br />Main actors are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as the perfect Wajda protagonist - the doubting reflecting mind unable to put all the aspects of his mind and emotion into life. Beautiful Celinska is with great body acting debuting in a character unable to express all her inner in her proud movements.<br /><br />Those who try to describe everything often are unable to take nothing in consideration. This is what Wajda manages. His films are either very moving deep or beautifully shot but pays attention to lifes and societys particularity. A moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for a second the moment of grief for the third a moment of nothing for the fourth.<br /><br />There is at least two reasons to pay attention to Wajdas films of this period. First is the remarkable free expression of deep political impact. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. Second is the development of a filmatic and narrative language that Kusturica has rose to grandeur.',pos
'Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments.<br /><br />If one forgets the (failed) frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie he is again disappointed. The acting is OK but not great. The story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning while one is trying to get whats happening. But toward the end one understands there is not much to understand. Scary elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason...<br /><br />So... (yawn) See this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds.',neg
'This is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie Lynch stuff. Rather its for those who either appreciate a good story or have grown tired of the run-of-the-mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and Oprah-ish This is such a wonderful movie! You must see it!-semantics (tho she IS right for once!).<br /><br />The story unfolds flawlessly and we are taken along a journey that I believe most of us will come to recognize at some time. A compassionate existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise.<br /><br />Acting is without faults cinematography likewise (occasionally quite brilliant!) and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story.<br /><br />A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental.',pos
'I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe was able to accomplish in regards to its overall affect on me. I say this because I know this independent film had a limited budget/resources but despite this it comes across as a convincing and well crafted piece of work.<br /><br />Enjoyable from start to finish with several relatively unknown actors which I cant help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in years to come Eddie Monroe didnt fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional meter dancing. Its a well scripted story with a startling ending despite my effort to not be taken off guard.<br /><br />Many of the cast names listed for this film are names to look out for in the future. Someone told me that Paul Regina recently passed and if this is true its a real tragedy since his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable.<br /><br />Kudos to Fred Carpenter who has truly pulled out a winner with this one!',pos
'I chanced upon this movie because I had a free non-new release from Blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly as the store was getting ready to close for the evening. The plain white cover and title intrigued me. Im a (relatively speaking) old lady and my son is a young man of 30. I adore movies that are sheer entertainment such as The Sixth Sense Interview With A Vampire Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son on the other hand is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. We generally hate each others movie choices HOWEVER we both watched and LOVED the movie NOTHING! It was unlike any movie wed ever seen before. Were both cynical/critical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them -- but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish. It is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the U.S. it would have done very well indeed.',pos
'Ive watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting considering medical facts that can be learned. But this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the shows characters. Everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone even during office hours which is ridiculously unrealistic. There doesnt seem to be one solid lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show - everyone is broken up and on the prowl - hardly a true reflection of all Americans. Indeed there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and its truly fulsome.<br /><br />Then we are presented with endless little moral dilemmas and theyre generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who doesnt agree with the all-knowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice. For instance in one of the latest episodes were presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and Addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because were supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on. Anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupid.<br /><br />And I think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats pro-lifers. Addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds. The general feeling was that if you opposed abortion youre a freak - hardly the popular sentiment in the US. Two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression. Whats more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in. The script could have been written by Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />All in all this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far-fetched medical situations throughout the whole show.',neg

'This Worldwide was the cheap mans version of what the NWA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions made back in the 1980s on the localized Big 3 Stations during the Saturday Morning/Afternoon Wrestling Craze. When Ted Turner got his hands on Crocketts failed version of NWA he turned it into World Championship Wrestling and proceeded to drop all NWA references all together. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were relabeled with the WCW logo and moved off the road to Disney/MGM Studios in Orlando Florida and eventually became nothing more than recap shows for WCWs Nitro Thunder and Saturday Night. Worldwide was officially the last WCW program under Turner to air the weekend of the WCW buyout from Vince McMahon and WWF.

'In the trivia section for Pet Sematary it mentions that George Romero (director of two Stephen King stories Creepshow and The Dark Half) was set to direct and then pulled out. One wonders what he wouldve brought to the film as the director Mary Lambert while not really a bad director doesnt really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of Kings novel of which he wrote the screenplay. There are of course some very effective grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly involving the sister Zelda likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film) and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect. But something feels missing at times some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably King-like atmosphere which is in this case about as morbid as youre going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in (who knows if hell save that for his final novel...) <br /><br />As mentioned though some of the casting is terrific notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80s horror movie to being a little monster (I say that as a compliment of course especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel). And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters who plays this old secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone. And applause goes to whomever did the make-up on Andrew Hubatsek. But there are some other flaws though in the other casting; Dale Midkiff is good not great as the conflicted disturbed father figure Creed and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just didnt work for me at all.<br /><br />In terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces only a couple really stand-out: a certain plot-thickening moment (not to spoil it does involve a cool Ramones song) and the first visit to the pet sematary (the bigger one) including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining. For the most part its a very polished directing job though it couldve been made even darker to correspond with the script. If thought out in logical terms (albeit in King terms) it is really one of his more effective works of the period. But it doesnt add up like it could or should. Still it makes for a nifty little midnight movie.',pos

It might be of interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960s the anti-war anti-establishment tune-in turn-on and drop out culture; but when you read the back of the video case theres no hint that that is what youre getting. If you do make the mistake of renting it though it is probably best viewed while on drugs so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching it I can tell you that it doesnt get any better after the first scene; so knowing that Im sure youll be fast asleep long before the end.',neg

I have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in Cephalonia but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled. It is all true the Italians would sing the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. The earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion.

'2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous.<br /><br />I thought with a cast of James Woods Cathy Bates Randy Quaid Lou Gossett Jr. and Henry Thomas - how could it miss. I was wrong.<br /><br />I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard was on the week-end he cranked out this piece of dribble. Id long suspected Sam S. of being kind of nuts this film based on his play confirms it.<br /><br />This is the kind of artsy b.s. that actors LOVE to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote. However for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash there is absolutely NOTHING to love about this movie.<br /><br />You havent seen dysfunctional families until youve seen this bunch. Pa is crazy Ma is crazy the son is crazy and the daughter is oh yeah crazy. They also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush especially the teenage daughter.<br /><br />In addition to the above as if that werent enough the plot--and its so thin you could read thorough it--has a hole in it the size of Alaska.<br /><br />Ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm. As it turns out so is Pa. Now I dont claim to be a real estate expert but the last time I checked property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold. If only one of them owned the property then the other could not legally sell it so it would be pointless for that person to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and therefore his plot does not work.<br /><br />Not that anything else was really working anyway.<br /><br />The only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity and I cant imagine why anyone would want to.',neg
'This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />I have to disagree with another commenter who said the special effects were okay. I found them pretty bad: it just wasnt realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story.<br /><br />Maybe that distraction is the reason that I did not fully understand the story. The archaeologists are looking for the set. They do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it. That also makes it unclear why they search for it in California while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient Egypt.<br /><br />If youre shooting a movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert. The beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert.<br /><br />The action-level was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax. It made the movie look short and thats certainly a pro for this particular movie.',neg

'Forget any angst-ridden documentary! This film is really an out and out comedy about a 40-yer-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford cant sing! And the film cuts away whenever he appears to be ready to burst into song. Yet Ford and equally vapid boyfriend Blake Harper whine and primp and run around in their tank tops determined to make dreams come true. Even funnier is manager Kyle who appears to have the I.Q. of a turnip and whose collagen-injected lips look like a bee stung him. How can grown men be so self-delusional? Bwa ha ha! As for the documentary the filmmakers dont appear to have any POV and the film is poorly structured and wildly uneven. Very little background information is provided about the three leads.

Chris Hegedus was one of the Directors of The War Room which was a great movie (albeit a little one sided) but it looked beautiful. Startup.com looked like it was shot in some guys basement. The quality was so pitiful that I couldnt stand watching it. I saw about 30 minutes or so and I had to take it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I cant understand how something so amateurish some from someone like Chris Hegedus. How the hell did this win any awards to begin with??? The War Room definitely deserved an award as did another great documentary called Ameragosa (both won awards).

I guess someone felt this was good enough for a 2004 re-release...<br /><br />Micheal Dudikoff is unfortunetly not a ninja in this movie one of the major flaws of this film right off the bat. Another major flaw would be that Ice-ts action scenes are stolen from other movies particularly the first scene of his rescue which is directly from the Wesley Snipes movie The Art of War with Ice-T edited in. I hope they paid for that footage.<br /><br />The plot is awful the special effects had little effort put into them (love those wires holding them in space) the acting is wooden (also love those New York/Russian accents).

'Although there are some snippets in this 4-part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform these are not very well-developed in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs.<br /><br />Although this program as a whole leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money and for that it deserves some praise almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to--very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you if asked they think the drug war is designed to solve. For example while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80s at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business. But instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame. Inexplicably alcohol prohibition the violence that ensued and the subsequent reversal of prohibition is totally ignored by this program.<br /><br />This program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war. The possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on. Use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems but not all users do their drugs in excess just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics.<br /><br />If you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science has decided to totally prohibit whose users it has decided to not-so-metaphorically wage war against just forget about it. None of that is in here.<br /><br />On the other hand this is hardly in the category of anti-drug propaganda. It is mostly an interesting neutrally-presented history of drugs in 20th century United States like marijuana LSD heroin cocaine MDMA and Oxycontin. But there is a significant element of various peoples points of view with regard to drug laws and most (but not all) of that is not very thoughtful or well-informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana. <br /><br />The criminal justice system along with its often harsh life-ruining penalties is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem but unfortunately theres an epidemic in this nation of an as-yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs a lack of compassion for fellow humans a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally-approved perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity. Its morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason. This is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs yet this program ignores it.<br /><br />So in sum the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining. But when it comes to presenting a rational non-radical point of view with regard to drug policy and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives its pretty disappointing.',neg
'Rock n roll is a messy business and DiG! demonstrates this masterfully. A project of serious ambition and perhaps foolhardiness the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups. With that said the abundance of quality material ensures the films ability to captivate the audience. If youve ever been interested in any realm of the music industry this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing. the music in the film although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting is worth the price of admission alone. the morning after i saw DiG! i went straight to the record store to pick up a Brian Jonestown Massacre album (i was already initiated to the Dandy Warhols sounds). Primarily defined by its exploration of rock music the film succeeds at other profound levels. DiG! is a sincere and sufficiently objective glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces.',pos

'I think its the sort of film you either love or hate and Im really not the type to go in for arty movies. My mother rented mullhuland DR the other night and I nearly ran from the room ha. But I love this film.<br /><br />We recorded The Beat one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great film that way by accident. Saved that tape and watched it a lot. I eventually got the VHS to add to my collection. Ive watched it many times and at one point copied down the poems. I even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class. She had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. She refused to let me do it. If it could upset my drama teacher that much it has to be good :) Honest she never treated me the same after that.<br /><br />I liked the acting it came off very true and honest. It wasnt clean and polished but it was better than that. It was true to life how anyone would truly behave and display emotions not how Hollywood does. It was great acting especially by the one playing Rex.<br /><br />The story was original. Not only do the characters get drawn into his world but you do too. Not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all. Simply caring and friendship make things a bit better.<br /><br />The only thing is that even in the 80s there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing but that little bit of innocence didnt hurt this film.<br /><br />I think its a must see. you will either love or hate it but either way it makes an impact and that makes a good film that you will remember and talk about later.',pos

'There really isnt much to say about this movie....its crude but fun.<br /><br />Plot outline (From IMDB)<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />Two losers from Milwaukee Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone) invent a new game playing basketball using baseball rules. When the game becomes a huge success they along with a billionaires help form the Professional Baseketball League where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities. Coop & Remers team the Milwaukee Beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to institute.<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />The Acting is pretty good since there arnt many big stars in this movie. Although I am not a big fan of Southpark Parker and Stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie. <br /><br />There are so many funny moments in this movie I cant come close to naming them all. It never really lets up and they dont try to put some cruddy drama in to make it more serious. <br /><br />And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. Its GREAT. I especially like Take me on and Beer by Reel Big Fish. Very underrated.<br /><br />Overall a crude but extremely funny movie. 10/10<br /><br />James Black Wolf Johnston',pos

In the days of Magnum I loved Tom Selleck I thought he was the sexiest man on the face of the earth!! A hunk on a television show is a must in order for women to enjoy watching something especially just for purposes of innocuous entertainment!!

'What a gargantuan pile of malodorous ordure! Ye Gods where to even begin with this one..<br /><br />Well mix crap acting (including one bloody infuriating woman who speaks as though shes either a) chewing painfully on some ice cubes or b) has just woken up after having undergone some extensive root canal surgery) editing that would appear to donate that the celluloid was cut and spliced via the utilisation of an angle grinder some truly hopelessly choreographed martial arts action a script that has ostensibly been written by a two year old and some of the most hideous and intrusively loud background music ever committed to any film and hey presto you have Death Machines aka The Ninja Murders (although note that surprise surprise  there are in fact no actual ninja anywhere to be found in this sodding travesty!) <br /><br />In a nutshell if ever there was a cinematic equivalent of a particularly vehement bout of dysentery then this must surely be it!

'Gee what a crappy movie this was! I cannot understand what people find so scary about The Grudge. The director plays one trick (Id have to admit a very good one that is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a consequence I startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie but once I knew the drill I practically fell asleep as The Grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute. To conclude I can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with that the so-called predecessor The Ring was way scarier and that buying a ticket for The Grudge is a waste of money.',neg
'In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show get inside the characters become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing but it still works. Watch a series or two of the show first before you watch this. Youll not be disappointed. Good episode to watch is No Spring for Frazer',pos
'I thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the advertisements that I saw in theaters. When my sister borrowed from a friend I decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . .needless to say ten minutes in the movie and I loved it. Amanda was a great actor in the movie her comedic timing was perfect. The guy who played Duke was hot plain and simple. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda walks by the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she is talking to her mom about dresses--as she is pretending to be a guy! I re-watched this part over and over... to make a long story short the movie I thought was going to be lame--I now own it.',pos
'I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted its not like the Sound of Music but its as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. Im a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in The Boyfriend. Its a modern musical and shouldnt be judged by all that went before. Its just the best for dreamers like me who wish they could find this place - no illness no wars no drugs all the bad things in life are gone. This is nothing more than a feel good movie. That is what all movies should be about. Shaun Phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie. If the acting isnt the greatest-who cares. I love the idea of the movie. Peter Finch a very stiff actor Liv Ullmann gorgeous as ever Sally Kellerman surprisingly good voice Michael York typical and Olivia Hussey stunning all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people. Not one of them acted like actors in a movie. They acted like real people the same way I would act if I found this place. Torn between going home and staying there in awe of everything. Yes there are flaws in this movie but get over it its not Citizen Kane its a feel good musical!',pos

'This isnt a good movie. Plain and simple. Take out the hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre plot average acting (at best) plodding direction and dull dialogue. Add in the grot and youve got mediocre plot average acting plodding direction dull dialogue with lashings of hardcore porn. Trouble is the porns nothing special either. So its not a good movie and nor is it a good porno. It fails on both counts. They can say that women made this movie and they were intending to do this with it and that with it etc. But talks cheap the end result is what counts and what we have here is a mediocre movie with some sex thrown in for shock value to try and con you into wasting your time watching it. One of those movies where youd rather have the time you spent watching it back.',neg
'I have seen this movie maybe a 100 times never grow tired of it.I saw this movie the first time when i was 7 years old and it has left a mark in my memories since then. Its a enchanting love story that brings the sun out in most people even in the darkest times. I think that this is a must see movie and one of Anthony Quinns best performance ever. I just wish that the TV-channels would send this movie more often. It has inspired me in a good way and surly will do that to many others. If there is any actor i wanted to meet it would have been Anthony Quinn. There will never be a like of him on the silver screens ever. Wish that Anthony Quinn was still alive.

'This is a great movie to watch with a good friend boy/girl friend or family. Basically one of those feel good movies you want to share with your loved ones....without all the girlie crap you find in a lot of American feel good movies. This movie is light hearted but makes you think and will make you laugh. <br /><br />Just a really simple but universal plot. Would think most people could relate in some way to this movie. The characters in the movie are amazing and the actors do a great job in sucking you into the movie. And the movie is topped off all along the way with hilarious true to life Jewish humor. I watched the movie for the first time last night and now I want to own it. :)',pos
'Brainless film about two girls and some guys they meet in an airport getting on the wrong late night shuttle bus and ending up in a whole world of trouble. Great twists and turns are totally and I do mean totally wasted in a film with a plot so incredibly stupid as to defy description. What is going on in a general sense is okay I mean the idea of a guy kidnapping unattended girls for nefarious purposes is a good one. The problem is that the details are so beyond belief that I would be shocked if you dont turn off the film in utter disbelief. Gee a guy who is suppose to be taking you home doesnt go any of the ways you know and you stay on the bus? It get worse from there think of every bad choice and this film has the characters make it even to the point where they could just walk away but never do. Whats annoying is that some of the twists and turns might have worked if there was something intelligent before it but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this film. Okay maybe there is the end the end is clever. The end is the sort of thing that should freak you out. it should be the oh #$*@!!!! moment and become a classic of horror cinema. Instead it just lies there among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. One of the most brainless films of the year.',neg
'This is one of my most favorite movies of all time. Pretty pathetic you say? Well yeah it is. But Chris is incredibly incredibly funny.

'Some films just fade away but Tourist Trap has withstood the test of time and has justifiably become a cult favorite. Though not completely original--it owes much to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre it holds its own with a sense of humor genuine creepy moments a brilliant score by Pino Donaggio and the fun performances by Chuck Connors and the cast. Dont let the PG rating keep you away this film proves that gratuitous gore and nudity are not needed in every horror film to make it entertaining. Those elements are usually used to cover the lack of thrills in a film. Here the scares are merited and effective. Plus only Chuck Connors could carry a scene in which he has to share soup with a mannequin! A classic scene indeed. Now more accessible on DVD in widescreen this film is a must for fans of 70s horror fare.',pos
'It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men. After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam Hoss and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldnt get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV western.<br /><br />Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships some go good some not so good its just life. And were less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we dont have to kill the character off to keep the survivors nobility intact. But thats if Bonanza were done today.<br /><br />But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped the secret of Bonanzas success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children. The kids were all different in personality but all came together in a pinch.<br /><br />The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys. Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that. <br /><br />Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show. Rumor has it he didnt care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious. Perhaps if it were done now hed have liked it better in the way I describe.<br /><br />This was just the beginning for Michael Landon how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest most hot headed but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. <br /><br />When Roberts left. the show kept going with the two younger sons but when big Dan Blocker left the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added on by that time David Canary Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But big loyal but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family.<br /><br />So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesnt look anything like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits is the Cartwright home the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real.<br /><br />And if they werent real they should have been.',pos

'Wagons East is widely known as John Candys last movie as he died on the set. Thats just what makes it so sad: not simply that Candy suffered a fatal heart attack but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie. Seriously I dont know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap but the flick has NO redeeming qualities. Its as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it. No wonder John Candy didnt want to make the movie; maybe his contractual participation was what did him in.<br /><br />Anyway the point is that Candy did much better than this throughout his career. To be certain he had already completed Michael Moores Canadian Bacon in which the United States declares war on Canada. Just stick with that one and you can say that Candy ended his career honorably. As for Richard Lewis - who previous had co-starred with Candy in Eugene Levys absurd but hilarious Once Upon a Crime - he made up for this piece of crap by frequently guest appearing on Countdown with Keith Olbermann in later years.',neg

'Please see also my comment on Die Nibelungen part 1: Siegfried.<br /><br />The second part of UFA studios gargantuan production of the Nibelungen saga continues in the stylised symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor. However whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scale.<br /><br />As in part one director Fritz Lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands. These pictures should only be watched with the note-perfect Gottfried Huppertz score which fortunately is on the Kino DVD. Now with this focus on mass action Lang is presented with greater challenges in staging. The action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestra.<br /><br />But just as part one made us witness Siegfrieds adventures matter-of-factly and without excitement part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy. In both pictures there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters. Thats why Lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action never allowing us to feel as if we are there (and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of Langs work). Thats also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkers.<br /><br />Nevertheless Kriemhilds revenge does constantly deal with emotions and is in fact profoundly humanist. The one moment of naturalism is when Atilla holds his baby son for the first time and Lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild frantic ride of the huns. The point is that Lang never manipulates us into taking sides and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the Wagner opera. The climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene. Why then did Hitler and co. get so teary-eyed over it a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films? Because the unwavering racial ideology of the Nazis made them automatically view the Nibelungs as the good guys even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin. For Hitler their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy not a human one.<br /><br />But for us non-nazi viewers what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm. When you see these fully-developed silent pictures of Langs it makes you realise how much he was wasted in Hollywood. Rather than saddling him with low-budget potboilers they should have put him to work on a few of those sword-and-sandal epics pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally where its the poetic operatic tonality that sweeps us along.',pos
'This movie looked like the out-takes of the deleted scenes from a high school film class experiment. It made no sense! It was well acted but I only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop. The alien machines were created with Pentium I technology and no creativity they were crabs! The under-lit and barely seen aliens were Frisbees with legs. WHERE WERE THE TRIPODS? The editing done by director/writer/producer/make-up artist/gripper Latt jumps all over the place with some scenes repeated numerous times. Most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a movie someone needs to slap him. In 2005 alone he produced 11 movies! That doesnt include the writing editing directing or visual effects credits on other movies. If the rest are like this snot-load then hes just making fun of us. This was a slapped together rip-off of Spielbergs movie nothing more. Im looking forward to Latts BackBroke Ridge X-Man IIV The Hillocks have Eyes.',neg
'Sadly every single person I ask about this series says theyve never heard of it. I remember it fondly from my early childhood (I wasnt quite 10 when it came out).<br /><br />My favorite story was A Story Short. Something about the way the stone soup story was woven into a greater story gets me every time. And then the storyteller explains why he has no story to tell and it becomes a story itself. Ive always been a fan of Jim Henson and this is just one reason why.<br /><br />Im adding this DVD on the self with Labrynth The Dark Crystal The Neverending Story The Princess Bride The Last Unicorn Willow and MirrorMask. These are all DVDs I share with my siblings who are 6 5 and 4 yrs old.',pos
'My main criticism with the movie is the animation. I totally agree with everyone else it was very poor. Some of the characters seemed to have darker skin tones than they did in the first film which is much better. Also the background colours looked rushed and somewhat static. It is also a shame that Michael J.Fox didnt voice Milo he did such a good job and James Arnold Taylor wasnt sure whether he was supposed to sound like Milo or Aladdin. I have also taken into consideration the lack of a good storyline. the third story was confusing and clumsily told and the second story suffered from poor scripting. To make things worse the first one I cant even remember other than a fishing village being haunted or something like that. However there was some nice music and good voice talents from John Mahoney Cree Summer Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson that saved the film from total disaster. All in all a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good film. 4/10 Bethany Cox.',neg
'I really enjoyed the film. It was really cheesy at times. (They destroy the villain with hair driers--but where are they plugged in?) Its a unique film though and I enjoyed the acting of Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope. I also enjoyed Fanuel (however you write it...) liking Megans charecter because she called him a dweeb. Besides the acting the rewinding and showing what happened on Ariels and then Megans point of view was quite interesting. I saw it twice and Id see it again',neg
'There are three movies with this animation style that I fondly remember from my youth. This movie The Last Unicorn Flight of Dragons and The Hobbit. I own copies of both Dragons and The Hobbit (both excellent) and I hadnt seen The Last Unicorn in more than a decade. That was until today and now I wish I hadnt. What bothered me the most was the script. It was incredibly choppy and often inane. Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation. Were not just talking about little things here either; were talking about key plot points! The story itself isnt that great to begin with but it could have worked had the script been decent. Not even close. On top of that the music was awful! I know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball. This was one of those films that I was going to show to my kids some day but it just got cut. I dont think I could ever sit through that crap fest again. Disappointed is putting it mildly.',neg
'I agree that this film is too pretentious and it is not easy to know where it is going. I have been teaching literature and film for many years and I find this film to be one of the most over rated according to some of the previous reviews here. <br /><br />However let me remind you that this is the same director who has Lora di religione (Il sorriso di mia madre- My Mothers Smile) to his credit -- a gem of a film! <br /><br />Was he trying to outdo Fellinis 81/2 here???? The scene with the dogs which has also been pointed out is absurd and excessive  just one example. Others would take too much space and some reviewers have already noted them. <br /><br />Overall a most frustrating and annoying experience!',neg

'I am sorry to rain on everybodys parade. Just a little background about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema especially Japanese Chinese and Indian. Admittedly I am a novice when it comes to South-Korean cinema but if this is the best of the best sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and I do not fit the stereotype of the dumb American . . . well not perfectly.<br /><br />I cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon. This is a disgusting *and* ludicrous movie. Hammy acting - everything is badly done and overdone like begging for the uneducated viewers attention. Horrible camera-work with an insistence on meaningless close-ups derived from the MTV aesthetics.<br /><br />The plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of Swiss cheese. Nobody expects a thriller to be 100\% realistic and for the sake of entertainment Id be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details. But excuse me whats happening here that *can* stand even summary scrutiny? This story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket. (Dont want to spoil your enjoyment if thats the word so wont go into details of the plot.) The fighting scenes are violent unbelievable downright stupid (the main hero taking on dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time after he ONLY trained while imprisoned punching a wall ! ) The truly outstanding features of this movie are two: the lurid and incestuous sex (brother on sister and father on daughter well weve evolved since Oedipus didnt we?) and the graphic violence. The cut off body parts - hands teeth tongues - together with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this movie to be made?) have no esthetical function/motivation whatsoever.<br /><br />A feast for the S & M inclined admittedly but even for those a feast of no merit nor subtlety. Heavens even Mel Gibsons recent and much-discussed work on an almost similar theme wasnt THAT bad.<br /><br />The invariably good press this pretentious overblown overlong piece of gratuitous gore coming from Korean shores obtains makes me wonder whats happening. I dont think of myself as being the ultimate paragon of taste and often I am ready to accept that a movie I didnt enjoy may be better than I was able to perceive. However I have no scruples whatsoever in calling this one as I see it: bad bad bad. No redeeming qualities. My 2c? Find something better to do with your time.',neg
'Could easily have been better. In fact maybe so much so that if the filmmaker hadnt tried even as hard as he did it might have actually been better.<br /><br />On a good note. The lighting was reasonably okay. But pretty much everything else was lacking. Wobbly camera work. (Yeah yeah I know thats supposed to be the style now.) Poorly recorded audio. And editing that looked like someone watched too many Ulli Lommel movies (which are some of the worst edited movies.) To sum it up the movie seemed to be a rationalization for the director/writer/main-character to get some young women naked put them in fake bondage and grope them while saying menacing things.',neg
'Just a comment on New Orleans accents...<br /><br />An earlier reviewer noted the following: This film could have been shot in New York or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country. There was also another comment along these lines from an English reviewer.<br /><br />Many people in New Orleans do in fact sound broklynese. I have never found out why. (Its mentioned in A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole.) I always appreciate movies taking place in New Orleans that include this detail as this one did. Too often its just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent.',pos
'Just saw this film and I must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film this was absolutely horrible -- but not in the sense that was intended Im sure.<br /><br />It was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all would-be viewers are morons OR extremely hard up for entertainment OR both.... Thank God for fast forward! I cant imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film. I mean you have actors trying to be serious albeit barely and a script that cries for a total rewrite.... I just cant say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decided to do horror films this would be a good effort.<br /><br />If you found this movie to be entertaining then I strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies. There is MUCH BETTER fare out there. Join a club READ REVIEWS but above all avoid crap like this.',neg
'Amitabh and Jiah Khan raised great expectations by their press conferences though it was quite easy for the critics and the fans too that after all this much hyped Ram Gopal Verma Factory product is going to fall flat on its face in all the probabilities ! Why because Jiah was so immature and childish and Bacchan mixed up guilty and unsure . they themselves didnt know what the hell they were talking about to the press keeping up with the tag line that some love stories are not to be understood or some such rubbish ! Why the title is Nishabd ? Ramu needs to refresh his knowledge of Sanskrit as Vidhu Vinod needs to study Mahabharata tagging in line another glorious flop of the year Eklavya ! Comparison with the Sweet hearts and Lolits is inevitable as the so-called plot line is supposed to have inspired by them. but sadly Ramu has hardly made any serious effort to delve deeply into the psyche of the aging and the young ones. is lolly pop sucking the ultimate indicator of the innocence ? and contrary to that streak of childishness the leg show at the dining table with a Vijay that is Bacchan in that role bursting into squeals of shameless laughter incessantly after wards ? this girl is in fact at her seductive game luring poor Vijay to think she is in love with him. the legstoo are skinny enough and that act of putting the water hose through the legs is down right obscene. its beyond any ones understanding how can a girl  coming as a guest to some bodys house can be so brazen brash and over powering ? and why the hell that stupid wife played by Revathi remarkably well though scripted poorly and characterized unrealistically encourages her own husband to dance with a sexily saying young girl ? that part of Vijay trying to gain some refreshers to his humdrum life is absolute bullshit. because apparently it seems that he is happy as he is with a well settled life and a hobby to recreate. This reminds of Blame it on Rio the older daddy and his young love superbly played by Michael Caine. Bacchan looks terrible in close ups and over all where as kevin spacey and Jeremy Irons looked debonair and handsome which is why the young chicks some times get attracted to older men for their charming persona compared to the vulnerability of young boys of their age. only good thing about this movie is those green  sprawling land scapes  winding roads and pleasant cinematography. no substance or even any sparkling show of emotions drama  or even intriguing stormy sex like in Lolita this shallow movie has no wonder fallen flat on its face and had to be wound up from the screens during first weeks ! next time round before mindlessly copying any such theme from Hollywood Ramu should do his home work and Bacchan should think twice ! you can not fool all the people at all the times Mr. Bacchan!',neg
'Vanaja is a film of superlatives. It has an exceptionally well thought-out cast with Mamatha being the crowning jewel a superb production and possibly pre-production with Rajnesh at the helm a fantastic journey of rural Southern India through the eyes of a 15 year old a remarkable mixture of song and dance traditional and modern blended perfectly and a beautiful backdrop of lush color of the flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience. What a towering achievement for a debut director!! The casting was absolutely dead-on. I wish India would come out with more of such films. This film will remain as one of my top favorites for my entire life. 9/10.',pos
'This film always hits me hard emotionally at the end. Though the issues of the film - interracial romance and adultery - were controversial at the time this film goes way beyond those narrow parameters of ground breaking novelty and trail blazing uniqueness. Here we have a true love story as written by the woman involved in this love affair told in a brilliant aggressive style that extols the virtues and glory of mad passionate love. I love this endorsement of the only emotion that makes life truly worth living. Jennifer Jones is full of grace and William Holden is simply magnificent in his role as a reporter. A wonderful film that only people who have been in this kind of love can really appreciate and understand. And for those who havent yet been in love even just the hope that one day lightning can strike for you makes life worth living - because love is worth having even if but for a short time - even if you lose - because love is the stuff - the essence - of life. This film works for me. A warmly felt experience!',pos
'Dennis Quaid is tryin hard to prove us that Jerry Lee Lewis was a dumb guy. And hes doing too much to prove it. TV sequences are very good like a photocopy of old black and white footages.

I think the only good thing in this movie is to see young Winona Ryder.',neg
'Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates Separate Lies a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes its the story of a married couple James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggies Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car. He confronts Bule who admits he did it and promises to go to the police the next day. When James arrives home Ann is angry that he is making such a big deal out of it and states that she was driving the car. Of course James then isnt so eager to rush to the police. She suggests that they call Bule and tell him their decision. Oh f___ Bule James says. Well thats just it Ann says. I am f___ing Bule. James devastation is just the beginning in this well-crafted drama. Without giving the plot away this is a good example of how gender switching changes a story. Example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car into a lake and her children drown. She gets life in prison. What if the father had done it? The chair. Youd be surprised how often the outcome would be different. The same is true here - if it had been James having the affair and doing the subsequent activities viewers might feel differently about the story. If Ann were in James place it would be shattering. As it is its tremendously sad.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blindsided by the woman he adores and Emily Watson does a beautiful job as Ann who once she frees herself from her lies - her involvement in the accident and the happy marriage - knows what she has to do. Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective - indolent uppity and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in their dealings with one another and no one is all good or all bad.<br /><br />There are separate lies - James that his marriage is happy Anns as listed above - and there is one uniting lie - the accident about which all parties keep quiet. Its enough for Ann that Maggie knows. In the end all must deal with the separate lies that the single lie uncovered.<br /><br />Brilliant film.',pos
'I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was it bad.. From the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography-- none of it worked. Not to mention the set design/costumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period (it spans the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so). Even John Hurt whos usually an amazing actor was so over-the- top ridiculous. Granted Quinten Crisp is an over-the-top guy to begin with but Hurt was given nothing to work with here. I dont know much else to say except the audience I saw it with absolutely loved it.. so maybe its just me. But audiences love anything at film festivals when theyre sitting next to the director and all the actors. Its not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it will play. Personally I thought this movie was terrible. On the other hand it was so terrible that it was hilarious. Get drunk and give it a shot when its on HBO in 2 years if it ever makes it that far.',neg
'If youre going to spoof James Bond its a brilliant idea to find a leading man who resembles BOTH Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter so step forward Jean Dujardin who captures perfectly the Connery sneer that masquerades as a smile plus the self-delusion of Rossiter thinking he is suave. Dujardin plays it like a Clouseau who can hold his own at karate. The plot has him looking for Our Man In Schtook who has disappeared mysteriously and includes such improbabilities as a Nazi cell concealed inside a pyramid. If there is a jarring note it is the leading lady Berenice Bejo who has all the sensuality of a suet pudding and is eclipsed - but only just - by Aure Atika. Its good for one viewing but thats about it.',pos
'Completely agree with other review.<br /><br />I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasnt even a real sequel. This was after I slowly backed away from the TV with remote in hand jaw dropping lower and lower. <br /><br />The quality of the filming is beyond low budget. It doesnt even look like a freaking movie. If I were watching home video footage from a documentary I would expect it.<br /><br />In summary: Avoid avoid avoid. Boooo Lions Gate!<br /><br />Completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and I hope that Ive saved others from renting or owning it.',neg
'This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didnt exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that hopefully would spur them on to action. At least thats how it seemed at the time. In todays movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would definitely not be this ending however realistic. The sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time.',pos
'Olivier Assayas film stars Asia Argento as a woman who had a relationship with Michael Madsen. Madsen is a business man whos in financial trouble. In desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called Golden Eagle a company from the Far East. As Madsen begins his moves away from his company Asia Argento returns to his life. The pair had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for Madsen (with said Golden Eagle). Once Argento enters the film the film follows her as we see the tangled web shes woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control.<br /><br />Im not a fan. Actually I was quite bored as the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which I kept wondering what the point was other than to provide a meaty role for Argento. Argento daughter of director Dario Argento and a director in her own right is a unique actress. At times stunningly good she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. I dont think it completely works here mostly because the script is too complicated to support it. I didnt care what was going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way(she seemed more nut job than anything else). Im not blaming the actors but writer/director Assayas who has once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they dont really work. <br /><br />If you must try it on cable',neg
'This is a video version of a stage production with extra shooting for the video edition. The result gains both the drama of the stage with the impact of well produced film.

'Like the other comments says this might be surprise to those who havent seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But have you already seen Delicatessen there is nothing new it this film. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. I dont think its a worse film than Delicatessen but its a bore to see it now like it probably would be to watch Delicatessen again. There is really no point to the film nothing that really matter or stays with you. There may be a distant similarity to the films of Kusturica but hes really in a different league so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on Tuvalu.',neg

'Do not be mistaken this is neither a horror nor really a film. I firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure; the only reason it merited a star was the presence of Chris Pine.<br /><br />Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist a hint of surprise a plot to emerge - but no.<br /><br />The characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet dont have the time to develop - thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful (bring on the teen rock montage) state. The only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic companion.<br /><br />Their encounters with obstacles (be they human or physical) are brief confusing and entirely pointless.<br /><br />Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast. Lou Taylor Pucci couldnt be dryer if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert.<br /><br />Watch The Road watch 28 days Later watch day time TV...anything but this; I implore you.

'Frequently voted Chinas greatest film ever by Chinese critics as well as Chinese film enthusiasts from the outside and frankly I dont get it at all. What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable blandly directed and acted with a complete shrew for a protagonist. Wei Wei (dont laugh) is that shrew a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband (Yu Shi) for the past several years. It is post WWII and they live with the husbands teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated home with not much money (the man had been wealthy when they married). Along comes the husbands old best friend (Wei Li) who also used to be the wifes boyfriend when they were teens. She considers running away from her husband with this man while the husband pretty much remains oblivious thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend. Thats the set-up and it doesnt go anywhere you wouldnt expect it to. Ive actually seen the remake directed by Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian. It runs a half hour longer and is actually kind of dull too but at least it was pretty. This supposed classic is pretty intolerable.',neg

'I am not one of those who think King is a great writer his books are fine distractions for a few hours and often have interesting premises however they in my opinion fall apart pretty rapidly if you give them any serious thought.<br /><br />This film suffers from being a pretty exact re-telling of Kings story. If you have read the book there are zero surprises no changes no altering of scenes or characters. This is a film made by King fans for King fans.<br /><br />For the rest of us there is nothing terrible about the film it is a gypsy curse horror with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for to become thinner.

'Swayze doesnt make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 Scaramouche the 1952 Prisoner of Zenda and the 1950 King Solomons Mines; Patrick Swayze fails utterly. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was very good in an otherwise big flop. Also Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his (shoes)!!! For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlains 1985 version I now highly recommend it if you cant get your hand on the granger version.',neg
'I had never heard of this one before the owner of my local DVD rental outlet mentioned it to me; being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the U.K. I decided to check it out. The film turned out be a dull amateurish and ugly-looking ride; the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept! <br /><br />What’s worse the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings. Soon one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again; another still bed-ridden is quickly disposed of (after being forgotten for most of the duration). The heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house: a harridan of a bible-thumping mother (cue horrendous overacting) her repressed (and long-suffering) daughter and the latter’s weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests.<br /><br />Often resorting to dinner-table reminiscences by the man-hating mother (as a means of filling in the dreary to say nothing of unoriginal backstory) and which invariably develop into mother-daughter sparring contests the film does have one ace up its sleeve – the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film (as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore) or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time...',neg

The bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling not inscrutable at all. The viewer is surprised by the twists and turns and Welles closing line is an unheralded classic.

'I was thirteen years old when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York was 16-rated in Germany I entered the movie as fallback. It was so boring.

'This must be one of the most annoying arrogant poser films Ive ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness. It is clear there is virtually no plot even if this part of Greek history is material for great movies. He simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them. Death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam along with litanies processions and the like which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself. A totally incoherent result which can only leave you saying huh? or oh dear every two minutes. <br /><br />There is no character development at all nada zilch. Im usually complaining about some movies having two-dimensional characters but oh boy he managed to create one-dimensional characters. This is irritating for us and degrading for some of the actors. He even managed to make one of my favourite Greek actors Giorgos Armenis seem wooden. <br /><br />And going to the core of Angelopoulos film-making: No were not idiots. We do not want chewed food. Please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle. Theo do you really underestimate your audience so much or youre simply incompetent? Personally I think he tried to make a Greek Underground. No matter how he tries he cant reach Kusturica.<br /><br />Only saving grace: Photography costumes and the music.',neg
'Several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters. The shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives. All are transformed at the end of the movie. Adela (Antonia San Juan) leads a brothel; Her daughter Anita (Monica Cervera) is retarded and has a restricted life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife. Isabel (?ngela Molina) is a bored rich lady.<br /><br />Other characters are used to connect the five main women characters. In storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning: Some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience. The shoe-theme is driven to extremes: For example when Leire as a shoe-designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes faints she breaks one of her heels.<br /><br />In editing small connections are made between the scenes. A telephone rings a cigarette is lit a song etc. are used to make the connection and fast cuts. Frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching TV-levels. It is strongly music-driven to set tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters. One of the more moving shots is when Anita who makes the same walk every day widens her walk and restricted life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road: How the restriction of space is visually translated is well done. As with most Spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually using the soap-like stories as the simple backdrop. There is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautiful.<br /><br />As Ramón Salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong. Some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level including the acting (Adelas love life Isabels doctor). The shoe-theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor.<br /><br />This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is more technically competent but somewhat mechanical. This has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually. After seeing this you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie-city: Madrid.',pos
'Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time. One film that tends to get somewhat lost under the Vertigos and the Psychos is this film; Strangers on a Train the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever made. The story follows Guy Haines a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the Senators daughter if he can get a divorce from his current wife. One day on the way to see his wife he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall; and one that could ultimately cost him his life.<br /><br />The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinemas most intriguing and thought provoking of all time. What if two people swapped murders thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime and rendering their motive irrelevant? Could this truly be the perfect murder? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is lead into could happen to any normal everyday person. Everyone has someone theyd like to get rid of so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his? The chances of it happening are unlikely but its the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of Strangers on a Train; and in this situation anyone could. <br /><br />Is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony any better than Robert Walker? The man was simply born for the part. He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in. The character of Bruno is a madman but hes not a lunatic; hes a calculating conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable. His performance is extremely malevolent and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality. Unfortunately Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train and I believe that is a great loss to cinema. Nobody in the cast shines as much as Walker does but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger. Granger never really impresses that much but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against Walker. Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; and that is how it should be. Ruth Roman is Guys wife to be. She isnt really in the film enough to make a lasting impression but she makes the best of what she has. Alfred Hitchcocks daughter Patricia takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara the sister of Guys fiancé. She is suitably lovely in this role and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcocks direction is always sublime and it is very much so in this film. There is one shot in particular that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. Hitchcocks direction is moody throughout and very much complies with the film noir style. The climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting and I dont think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film. Its truly overblown and out of turn from the rest of the movie; but it works. There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time and the reason for that is that he doesnt only use the script to tell the films story but he also uses to camera to do so as well. Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. Its story is both intriguing and thought provoking and is sure to delight any fan of cinema. A masterpiece.',pos
'Im going to keep this review short and sweet....<br /><br />I saw the trailer for this and thought Id give it a whirl 5 minutes in and my initial thoughts were what the hell is this? But after 10 minutes I was hooked and after 20 I was picking my jaw up from off the floor. This film is a great example of how different a movie can be and furthermore its french. This film is high art eye candy wrapped up in a tidy futuristic film noir package the motion capture is very clever and the black and white animation style which has no grey although at first didnt do it for me totally captivated me and by the end of the film and I found myself wishing every film was made like this. I think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing it would have been very easy to ruin it had they not landed so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters (Just watch any Hong Kong legends film in English to see a perfect example)I gave it 9 although I gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels....',pos

The simple premise of Overnight is to try an communicate the message look at this guy he blew it all when in fact he has a strong underground following dealt with harsh blows from friends and executives all in the name of getting a project done in the way he envisioned it. Quite frankly the only productive par that any of these guys played in the overall execution of the Boondock Saints shoot culminated as nothing more than extra bodies in the first bar room scene after that all they did was whine why they werent a bigger deal based on the clambering of their rancid efforts on top of troys shoulders.

'Ill keep this short as a movie like this doesnt deserve a full review.<br /><br />Given the setting this movie could have been something really special. It could have been another 28 days later or even a Blair Witch Project<br /><br />The first 20 or so minutes of the movie I was really excited directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense although I dont think He managed to capture true eeriness of an empty London Underground.<br /><br />Characters were a big let down. Our heroine in this movie is a worthless piece of crap and you really dont care if she dies or not. As many people have said before I was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy who managed to give me a chuckle or two(whether intentional of the writers or not).<br /><br />The main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie but when he is revealed I was really disappointed. I wont spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match.<br /><br />All in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula.

'SPOILERS ALERT<br /><br />Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important film from my life because its the first film I remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4-year old scamp. The story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel and is a reason why its not possible to write this one off as a brainless Lassie clone.<br /><br />The basic story: Two dogs and a cat happily live in the Seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner San Francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months. The bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are though the young and happy-go-lucky American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical (due in part to his voice-over explaining his being abandoned as a pup picked up to an animal shelter and being bought by the family) though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling.<br /><br />The three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings by the way) driven on by Shadows instincts of direction. They meet several perils along the way hoping to make it home while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance. There are funny moments all the way through great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes) and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling punctuated by moments of sadness (such as when Sassys arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers).<br /><br />Somehow though I fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take. Somehow it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story.<br /><br />The ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg finds it hard to get out and gives up exhausted followed by Chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out telling him how important he is to him and how hes pushed them this far so he shouldnt throw it all away so easily. <br /><br />The way that this scene (brilliantly done) isnt concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. Then just as all seems lost he slowly appears and is reunited with the family. Chances conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown but also how the other two have as well. Hang on a second I think Im going to cry...<br /><br />Anyway I havent read Sheila Burnfords book so I dont pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie. But this is a film that all the family can watch and while the tots will love the talking animals older viewers will understand the plot line better (as I found when I watched the film again after several years without seeing it). This film is a masterpiece in cinema and I suggest that if you havent seen it you go out and get it!<br /><br />And please avoid the sequel (see my review for Homeward Bound II!)',pos

'!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!!<br /><br />You`d think a story involving Archie Grey Owl - An Englishman posing as a red indian - would have a massive amount of humour involved . In fact I`d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . However Richard Attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making GREY OWL a serious drama . Worse  he`s made an extremely dire film too . Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between Grey Owl and Pony ( Played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry . But to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he`s a native American . The producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of Archie being an Englishman - That`s why I wrote  Possible spoiler  it`s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is English  but it`s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there`s absolutely no surprise involved.<br /><br />Yes I do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn`t actually a new concept . Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN ( And possibly THE TWO TOWERS if you want to class it as having a green message ) that there hasn`t actually been a great ecological film . In fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes GREY OWL  a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor',neg

Jones (who also produced) in decent roles.<br /><br />Some of it is a little dated and cheesy but The Brotherhood of Satan kicks butt over Race the Devil and many other 70s Satanism flicks.',pos
'Target is the story of a special agent who after carrying out orders to assassinate Turkish Terrorists (note that this is one of those American movies for guys who love mindless nationalistic super-patriotic crap movies) returns home to find that his ex-wife and two kids are taking hostage. Charlie Snow has just a couple of hours to do whatever the terrorists tell him in order to get them back.<br /><br />This was by far one of THE worst movies I have ever seen. And had it not been for someone I know actually (and probably mistakenly) taking it out of the video store I would never have watched this giant pile of garbage to begin with.<br /><br />The movie plays out like any generic action movie story I have ever seen before. In fact these are the kind of things they spoof on variety shows that is how bad it is. I half expected In Living the Colors Homey the Clown to Mad TVs Will Sasso doing his Steven Segal impression to bust out on the screen half way through to remind you that this was just an exaggerated action movie but now our characters are here to spoof how ridiculous it really is. There were not even any good fighting or action sequences. By the way things are played out you wouldnt even think that anyone was kidnapped that there were any terrorists or that anything remotely interesting was going on.<br /><br />Not only is the story completely and utterly uninteresting the acting is so terribly wooden. Just watch the part where Stephen Baldwin as former special agent Charlie Snow is talking to the kidnappers on the telephone. They tell him that they have his wife and they put her on the phone. She says Charlie help! or something to that effect. And Baldwin replies its okay honey in such a deadpan manner you think he was reading the script and trying to sound out the words phonetically. I imagine that despite being such a ridiculously bad movie (one that belongs on the bottom 100 on IMDb--a list that they should expand to at least 250 movies and should contain nearly every Stephen Baldwin movie) someone with some talent could have at least made the effort not to ham it up as much. Someone. Anyone. I couldnt get past the fact that everyone sounded like they were reading from a script. Save that is the only person in the whole friggin movie who has any talent whatsoever (and thus should not have been in this) Mad TVs Deborah Wilson.<br /><br />This was the capital cheese fest. How truly embarrassing.',neg
'Sudden Impact tends to be treated as Eastwoods artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director. The reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support. In some places it actually owes more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry film. One might argue if that is so- at the end of the day its a film about guilt justice and retribution. For me at the end of the day its more empathy than sympathy. However in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film. Forget the Go ahead punk make my day scene thats iconic but not original. But look at the views of San Fransisco taken from the air zooming in on the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where Sondra Lockes character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital. Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. So all in all Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology. Also I think this is the first well paced film Eastwood directed. Although Eastwood has enormous talent as a director dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me Breezy etc.) Thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog.',pos
'Does exactly what you expect and then some. The first movie was a step up from the TV show with sicker stunts airing uncensored and a gnarly factor that had increased. Surprisingly Jackass Number Two is even more twisted.<br /><br />The stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular with some mind blowing painful antics sprinkled with good fun skits to keep that smile turning into a curl of disgust.<br /><br />Knoxville like always dominates the proceedings but this time he has reason to take centre stage as he volunteers for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stunts with Bam Magera also proving himself as wild as ever despite having had his image toned down in Viva La Bam. Surprisingly the infamous Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to take part in fewer of the skits despite being focal in the previous outings.<br /><br />If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez then you will definitely enjoy this film and will laugh your guts out for the 100 minutes of its duration if you see it as childish disgusting or a sad snapshot of the youth culture of today you will find it as offencive as ever. So f**k off.',pos
'I really liked the movie thought it was very entertaining as well as dramatic. But I just had a question about the music is the movie. I havent been able to find any kind of soundtrack(if there even is one). And specifically I was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the boys are going down the river on their way to New Orleans? I thought it was something along the lines of My great escape but Ive searched on the internet books pretty much everything I could think of to try to and I just cant find it anywhere. If someone could help out it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.',pos
'Though the plot elements to The Eighth Day seem like they have been done plenty of times the film still has much of the spark mystery and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormals first film had. Though not as good as Toto the Hero which will always remain on my favorites list the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions. Daniel Auteil from 2001s flavorless The Closet downplays his part afraid to overact (rightfully so the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic). However I felt the part needed a bit more realism to it focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the characters growth.<br /><br />Dont walk into this movie expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got from Toto the Hero because you will be disappointed. However the film still serves as a decent if not flawed movie',pos
'The title role of this western is played by Robert Walker Jr. Hes a young gun who with partner David Carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a Mexican general. In eluding their pursuers Carradine and Walker become separated. Walker comes upon the camp of lawman Robert Mitchum who takes a liking to Walker and makes him a protégé and reclamation project of sorts.<br /><br />This is the first of two films Robert Mitchum did with writer/director Burt Kennedy. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. <br /><br />Not that Young Billy Young does not have its moments of hilarity. But it is a tripartite story involving the Walker reclamation Mitchums hunt for the bad who killed his son and a romantic triangle involving Mitchum Angie Dickinson and town boss Jack Kelly.<br /><br />The film abounds with nepotism. David Carradine is Johns son. Dean Martins daughter Deana is in this Walker is the son of Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones and Mitchums son Chris plays Mitchums son in some silent flashbacks.<br /><br />Robert Mitchum got his start in westerns and always looks right at home in them. Angie Dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in Rio Bravo. Walker had a brief career playing rebellious youths and doing a good job at it. Ive often wondered what happened to him. He looks hauntingly like his father. Maybe he didnt want to come to such a tragic early end like his father.<br /><br />And it that wasnt enough Mitchum fans get to hear old rumple eyes sing the title song at the beginning of the film.',pos
'Screenwriter Steve Tesichs sophomore effort (following upon the wildly overpraised BREAKING AWAY) is a compendium of clichés coincidence and dour melodrama. Perhaps he lived some of this; if so Im sorry to say he was inexplicably unable to dramatize any of it convincingly.<br /><br />In fairness hes not helped much here by Arthur Penn a talented director whos done remarkable work in the past (BONNIE AND CLYDE LITTLE BIG MAN) but fails to inject any energy or verisimilitude into Tesichs narrative. <br /><br />The cast struggles as best they can but are saddled with weak motivation and dialogue. Sympathies should be reserved particularly for Craig Wasson whose morose performance presages the impending quick fade of his leading man career as well as the embarrassingly untethered Jodi Thelen miscast as the films extremely unlikely femme fatale.<br /><br />It all seems longer than it is and any points made are heavy-handed and obvious. See Arthur Penns earlier take on the subject of the 60s the droll and elegiac ALICES RESTAURANT; its everything this one isnt.',neg
'The main premise for this movie is every womans fantasy: a vagina that kills and eats men. Well at least it is a fantasy for every woman who has ever had a fight against a man. Whats that 99.9999\% of women? But dont worry its not a gory kind of eating of men. Its more like a comical slurping them in like a drain plug. Theres no blood or parts left behind. So for blood guts & gore fans forget about this film not much gore here.<br /><br />The two main characters of the film are somewhat unrealistic. Helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. Meanwhile Dennis is a nice guy who stalks Helen.<br /><br />The story is already a little silly at this point but then they throw in two more equally silly sub-stories that just send this movie into the bad B-movie territory. The first new sub-story is about Dennis finding new love with a pair of conjoined twins; and then eventually murdering one of them and becoming a fugitive bank-robber. The second new sub-story is about Helen finding new love with a nice policeman who rescued her from a prostitution-related bad date and decided he wanted to marry her. Dennis and Helen eventually meet up again at the end of movie in totally unbelievable circumstances and magically Helens murderous vagina is cured!',neg
'This one is a poor attempt at spinning the old cons turn good yarn which we have seen so many times before. It actually reminded me of the American series The Players although nowhere near as good. Omar Epps is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the bunch as is Ribisi whos attempt at being the funny guy gets lost along the way. Danes performance was decent though and you can see from this performance why she was cast in Terminator 4.<br /><br />The MOD Squad is a film which lies in a kind of grey area between serious thriller and comedy. At times it takes itself serious but other times it tries to be humorous but fails miserably. The film has a kind of half-finished feel about - as if it was stretched to the 90 minute mark.<br /><br />Youl be disappointed.',neg
'Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song Honey Roll and poem I Meant To Do My Work Today by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film! It was no surprise that a lot of the people involved with this movie went on to become the best in their field.',pos
'The worst part about this film is that it did not have to be so terrible.<br /><br />They had a nice budget though so do many films; they made it look slick and pretty and best of all they had the 21st century lesbian-savvy audiences who would embrace a lesbian positive film... and yet the writer and director went out of their way to lift every single redone film bit about lesbian torment and confusion at boarding schools (you know the place all lesbian love lives and dies). <br /><br />This is a theme that has been done again and again and AGAIN in film but something that viewers-if one uses this voting forum as a clue- cannot seem to get enough of.<br /><br />Every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through. The lead characters say it all: the crazy abandoned genius rebel lesbian tough girl (well they took a super pretty femme like Piper Perabo and tried to rough her up but it didnt stick much) seduces pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her. <br /><br />Watching them every step of the way is character 3 a dopey well-meaning wide-eyed good girl observer. I say every step because she shares her every thought with the audience via the stiffest most inane monologues.<br /><br />Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well... talk. Hearing them (make love) with their noises was um you know like well... okay! she says about her 2 wanton roommates who roll around in the bed next to her.<br /><br />Later she asks Graham Greene- the accomplished native American actor who is completely wasted in a roll as a gardener (!) Is it wrong to care what people think?<br /><br />Sorry but is she a teenager or is she age 7?<br /><br />Granted Piper Perabo (as Polly the tortured dyke) & others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter. Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera. She would do well in a decent project so this is in no way a criticism of the acting.<br /><br />But this story is SHAMELESS in perpetuating every single stereotype about lesbians all rolled into one character. They couldnt stop with her (Polly) being an angry crazy-passionate secret genius who finished math problems for the speechless teacher. Oh but thats after she argues with the teacher who dares accuse her of gabbing.<br /><br />Thats a word THEY (males) use against US (women)! she says stomping out of the classroom.<br /><br />Is this ALL the writer could come up with? Or maybe we should ask: Why stop there? <br /><br />Poole and co. went on and made Polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks by screaming their name in the woods.<br /><br />Cue the slow motion sci-fi Xena atmosphere!<br /><br />Then we have her writing to her birth mother... (most lesbians are love-starved orphans in case you were in the dark).<br /><br />Then we have two teachers (one uptight one a zany type with loose neck ties) who hover around all of the action (the school looks awfully big for just 2 teachers)... and give dark child/ seductress/bird girl tense looks. Hmmmm. I wonder if something well you know... um FUNNY is happening between these TWO TEACHERS??????<br /><br />There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done. Heartbreak happens but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock.<br /><br />I cannot reveal the ending out of respect to those who force themselves to sit through til the end but if you are not laughing I can only guess you are crying. And not for the right reason. And I dont mean the wimpy make out scenes.',neg
'This movie was like a bad indie with A-list talent. The plot was silly all the way to the end. It reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980s. I would have given it a one but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile. I think the worst thing was the underwater scenes held off of the dock. The underwater lighting seemed to come from no were and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air this air tank would kind of appear. I would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Good Day.',neg
'This is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens. I unfortunately did not see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating drivel - and Im still waiting for the laughs to arrive. I love Tasmin Greig having been a big fan of both Black Books and Green Wing and therefore know that she is capable of the very best of comedy parts. However she played this part as well as she was able considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided. Please broadcasters bear in mind that the Trades Descriptions Act may well be invoked if you continue to bill as comedy material which is at best pseudo psychological romanticism and at worst a drama which poses as a quirky comedy to hide the fact that is neither fish nor fowl.',neg

'To paraphrase Thora Birch: I kind of like this movie. Its the exact opposite of everything I hate in a film.<br /><br />This obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign. And a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens - where instead the focus is on character development has a limited target audience. Whoever heard of a mature teen movie?<br /><br />But if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the DVD you could do a lot worse. My Teachers Wife is nothing revolutionary but it has a lot going for it and holds up well to repeated viewings.<br /><br />Jason London (as high school senior Todd Boomer) is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in The Man In the Moon and Dazed and Confused. He is helped out by exceptional work from his supporting cast. Tia Carrere in the title role is a revelation (she can act) as Todds calculus tutor and love interest. Christopher McDonald as the teacher in a nice self-parodying performance. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as Todds best friends and Jeffrey Tabor as his father. <br /><br />As someone commented earlier this is a mature teen movie because the romantic relationships are universally unsuccessful-at least by traditional happy ending standards. Even Todds parents are indifferent to each other with his father panting after the title character and his mother (Leslie Lyles) literally on the telephone during her entire time on screen (a device that provides increasing comedy relief with each successive appearance). The London-Carrere romance has unexpected charm and is far more believable than any other older woman storyline you are likely to find. <br /><br />But the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of the three friends. There is no overwrought melodrama here just three immature people who alternate between testing and trusting each other subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing. They actually manage to pull off a believable three-person relationship perhaps the first one in cinema history. <br /><br />Then again what do I know? Im only a child.',pos
'(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy actioner (and I use the term loosely) that Ive been trying to watch for over a year. Ive finally gotten to the end and now I wish I didnt put in the repeated effort.<br /><br />In an effort to save two hours of your life Im going to tell you he plot- a guy who has the ability to project a long blade out of his arm returns home to see his mom. Things turn ugly after he is beaten up by the mafia boyfriend of an old girl friend. He takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home. The guys mafia mom sends her men out to get revenge while the cops begin looking for him as well.<br /><br />Very little is said. no explanation is really given for anything (like why they lock id girlfriend in an asylum) and the action for the most part is all off screen. The film essentially consists of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody looking intense and not saying anything killing people (off screen-most of the action happens off screen). It looks good is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film. Hell I would have liked some sense of real character development or back story (all we know is that the guy was picked on as a kid). The movie runs the better part of two hours and it feels like its six. If they werent going to tell us anything they could have at least picked up the pace so it seemed like it was moving too fast. No instead we get the hero on a boat. The hero in a bus the hero walking the hero looking disturbed.Hero with his girl. It really annoyed me since I think this could have been a good film if they had simply done something or had someone actually say something meaningful other than give instructions to get this guy.<br /><br />4 out of 10. Its about four hours (all my attempts to see this) Ill never get back. Only for those who want to see a brooding Russian action film with very little action',neg
'Once again I fell for it in my roots I crave a fun and gory horror film even a vampire one. Even if its stupid as long as I get my fun gore in the mix Im a happy camper it doesnt take much. So I saw the cover of Bled over at Hollywood Video and was kind of curious what it was about it looked kind of interesting so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for it? Not only did this movie not fulfill the satisfaction I needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity but I was bored out of mind. This movie has the kahoonies to say its a vampire movie and its really not! Im so close to going back to the store and begging for money back because this is one of the rare times I actually turned the movie off.<br /><br />An artist meets a vampire I think dunno Im still trying to figure out what the heck he was but his name was Reinfield so Im assuming maybe hes a cockroach eating guy who likes to freak people out? I think I dunno. Anyways he thinks the artist has a certain flare for darkness so he gives her a drug to go into an alternate fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive? I think I dunno. So her friends get excited and decide they wanna try the drug too I think I dunno. So after they decide to try the drug things get weird the fantasies are real I think I dunno and the vampire is now enjoying the will big breasted girls in scandly clad clothing. I think I dunno. But a couple of the girls really end up being vampires? I think I dunno.<br /><br />Sorry for all the I dunnos this is possibly one of the worst reviews Im going to write but thats because this movie was just awful boring and confusing. I love just seeing these wanna be actors who you can tell are waiters looking for that big break. Not too smart that they fell in the cliché of the horror genre sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt in this case they really should have read the script. Because the movie the look the feel the acting everything about this movie was just bad I really recommend that you just pass the movie if you see it at your video store. This possibly could have been an interesting movie with its concept of a different dimension but why did they pick this director to display his creativity if he even has any? This was a bad movie just stay away.<br /><br />1/10',neg
'After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes Shark Boy and Lava Girl) -- I truly enjoyed watching Fried Worms. For once I did not guess the ending! It was funny and entertaining and didnt resort to a ton of gross-out humor despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) both LOVED it too -- oh and my 45 year old boy had a smile on his face the whole time. This is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents. The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. He is not stopping singing just to annoy me!! Also the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is right-on with the way kids behave. Of course the parents have to act a little goofy -- but my favorite scenes involved the Dad getting used to his new job. Have fun!',pos

'When the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of California I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up. Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmys aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without the animal robot role-playing or the incest aspects.Theres one good sex scene between Byron and Parker but its not good enough to save this film.<br /><br />My Grade: D+',neg
'First of all I need to say that Im Portuguese and its not usual to me spend my time watching Portuguese movies probably one each year or even none...<br /><br />...And the reason is the almost generalized idea between the Portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made! However in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when Leão da Estrela e Costa do Castelo were among the worlds best of their time with movies like Pulsação Zero or Sorte Nula both from director Fernando Fragata and also with some actors and music in common.<br /><br />This one is also good not of the same kind because it isnt a true comedy; in fact its officially a drama a womans drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the hypothetical travel to the Caribbean just to get laid. <br /><br />The plot works and can surprise us a few times; the actors are fine the locations regular as the score; but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenix.<br /><br />If you want to watch a Portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills one to be measured.',pos
'The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie. And once you see the cover art to this film of a frozen zombie coming out of their cryogenic chamber youll think you were in B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least thats the way I approached this film. But boy was I in for a shock<br /><br />I love horror movies. I love B-Movies as well. Nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies monsters murderers that sort of thing. But to say that this movie was lacking is an understatement. This movie was pure trash. Youd think the zombies would look somewhat like what the cover-art of the box displays but instead you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any Halloween display counter. Furthermore the script is beyond pitiful. Our main character Joseph suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks solace in the warm-hearted Mary played by Blair. Not once do you see any sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of Josephs character. Instead we see the head of the cryogenic labs a man named Dr. Miller eager to get the dead bodies and experiment with their organs. There is no emotion or anything to make you believe you should give a damn about anyone in this film.<br /><br />All and all very disappointing. All the elements to make a great horror film were there. You had your zombies your decent actors and your story. But the lack of good writing and little if any sense of direction screwed this one up royally. Overall 4 out of 10',neg
'I get it the Diehl character is sposed to be a microcosm of America itself - seeing Arab terrorists under every rock only to find out at the end that its his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good-will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops. Sorry Wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well-made amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters dialog and plotting. Better luck on your next flick. Another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of LA being there for reasons of hunger these people dont get enough to eat. Truly these folks arent eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger an emotional hunger a mental hunger. They need self-respect self-worth dignity which you cant give a man. Yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available. Less the center for hunger in America I would say its more the center for alcoholism drug-abuse mental suffering and economic devastation. Dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band-aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age-old human problem of homelessness. Bill Diehl was good though and Michelle Williams was cute as the young yet (cliched) old soul.',neg

You have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way Doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This equals on big happy movie in the end. This movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture. The cinema-photography is excellent in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers. Bound to be in Oscar contention for best foreign film.',pos

I really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right. The only problem is the annoying visual style which will either make you hate the movie or hate Tony Scott. I really feel sorry for the cinematographer because Im sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the DP for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like its been possessed by demons. I wouldnt have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when its spread through out the whole movie then thats when we have some problems. The same annoying style was recently used on Domino and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie.<br /><br />-Another person I feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great Harry Gregson Williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images. Somehow Williams wrote some decent music for the movie but Im sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better. The sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience it rather makes you feel like youre being punished. The overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it. I dont know why Scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie.<br /><br />-The acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals. Little Fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart. If the end of the movie doesnt make anyone cry then theyre dead on the inside. Denzel Washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily for him he gets to play a great character. The whole idea of a man thats lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but Washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character. I love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge. Radha Mitchell plays Marc Anthonys wife and she along with Fanning are the two reasons why I cant hate the movie too much. J.Los husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesnt really stand out much. Mickey Rourke and Chris Walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact.<br /><br />-One thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray Mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie. A little too late for that if you ask me. Lets hope that Tony Scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him CAN and must do better than this.',pos

In under a minute he is packed off to Morrocco where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fight.<br /><br />Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare possess fine light opera voices (with little acting ability) and theres a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along.<br /><br />This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers. With more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation.',neg
'I like Wes Studi & especially Adam Beach but whoa is this movie a load of pretentiousness. Ponderously slow. Overly cryptic to the point of obfuscation not because the plot warrants it but because there is almost no plot. Even less in the way of characterization. This is almost like one of those creaky old Charlie Chan mysteries (the cheaper Monogram studio versions) with lots of red herrings & oddball characters (like the old ex-senator with the checkered past who is now a recluse) & loads of people getting killed over objets dart that you wouldnt look twice at in the mall. Great scenery though. Pretty hair on the redhead too although I never did figure out what she was doing in this at all. Neither could my wife. Sheesh at least the old B-movies had the decency to be short.',neg
'I cannot believe that this movie was ever created. I think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse. The zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup. The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. Finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation. The best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished. Again to reiterate other user comments the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie. Also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all. It is never explained.',neg
'Why take a perfectly good original drama based on a perfectly good novel and remake it as a quasi-musical? And cast it with actors exclusively lacking in singing or dancing talent? Somewhat akin to Showgirls or the two most recent Star Wars films Lost Horizon is full of unintentional laughs. Who can forget Sir John Gielgud smiling uneasily in his Dali Lhama outfit overseeing an interpretive dance to the Republican party (Family)?<br /><br />Or Sally Kellerman warbling lovingly to George Kennedy doing her best Cher impression as she hops from one rock to another (Every Little Thing You Do)? And my favourite Bobby Van embodying the strength of Americas education system (Question Me An Answer)? I cant wait for the DVD release as hopefully it will contain comments by Liv Ullmann who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to do this film!',pos
'Amy Heckerlings second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930s gangster films made in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keatons mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin yeah thats right Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keatons younger brother turned district attorney Glynnis OConnor his wife and Marilu Henner plays Keatons moll. The film looks notoriously cheap making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film.<br /><br />The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags the film holds its own for the first half but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious not funny. Piscopo does the once bit one time too many. Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito Dom DeLuise Ray Walston as a street vendor Alan Hale Jr. as a desk sergeant and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties actual 1939 release date. *1/2 of 4 stars.',neg
'It ran 8 seasons but its first in early 1959 and its last in the autumn of 1965 were shorter than seasons 2-7. CBS chief William Paley canceled Rawhides production after watching the 1st show of season 8 in September 1965 because he disliked the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor who had departed after season 7. The last new episode aired in November 1965. The lone 1966 CBS broadcast on January 4 1966 was a rerun. <br /><br />I have often wondered why Rawhide didnt switch to color filming for its last season? Most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965. CBS was broadcasting in color that autumn for many of their sitcoms but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and last prime time network series to switch to color) on September 17 1966 for the episode Snap Decision.',pos
'The first film ever made. Workers streaming from a factory some cycling most walking moving right or left. Along with Melies the Lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with Melies begins narrative fiction cinema fantasy artifice spectacle; with the Lumieres pure unadorned observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former.<br /><br />But consider this short again. There is nothing objective about it. The film is full of action - a static inhuman scene burst into life activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured decentred from the back to right or left (but never of course the front where the camera is). And yet the camera stands stock still contains the energy the possible subversion subordinates it to its will. The cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map out the world edit it restrict it limit it.<br /><br />worse is the historical reality of the film. These factory workers are Lumiere employees. The bosses are spying on their workers the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions. The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gates the workers are confined in their workplace. The opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom escape but they face another wall the fourth wall further confining them. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance an image of unseen all-seeing authority entrapping its servants. A frightening all too prophetic movie.',pos
'The Forgotten (AKA: Dont Look In The Basement) is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror movie.<br /><br />The story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited about.<br /><br />The patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially Sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone. (Look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera tell me you can watch without laughing!).<br /><br />Now the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesnt really deserve its place on the video nasties list!.<br /><br />Overall if you arent looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then its worth a watch.',neg
'Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure the image of the cranes that are crossing a Muscovite sky. They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment.<br /><br />In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration. It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams.<br /><br />But Man is not a bird. Life draws up its own rules from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort. War breaks out and without much hesitation Boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty. He cannot even say good-bye to Veronica for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away. Surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract Boris attention must inevitably fail.<br /><br />Boris eventually gets killed in war without Veronica learning about it for the moment. His brother Mark a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption is eager to take his place. Veronica initially resists but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms. A marriage takes place which is never accepted by the family.<br /><br />Soon feelings of guilt seize hold of Veronica and she realizes that Boris return is the one and only thing she actually longs for. She therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the self-sacrificing work in a field hospital.<br /><br />When war finally is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers. Again Veronica is among them forcing her way through a wall of bodies. In her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris death.<br /><br />Once again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines. But now Veronica is watching them on her own and the look in her eyes is a different one. She has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans to follow the guidelines of your dreams. For all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fate.<br /><br />',pos
'This movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it and didnt have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school! Admittedly the storyline was decent...but i found the acting terrible! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste i thought her performance was wonderful. She was the only highlight without her i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film. Every time i hear somebody say daarling i cringe! i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said it. It made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life!<br /><br />(i apologise if this has offended anybody i am only expressing my opinion)',neg
'I avoided this film as a boy because I thought it would be boringno fights or shooting cops robbers cowboys or Indians. It was definitely not a cool film to like. So I didnt see TRC until I was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful captivating films I have seen. All the actors deliver the characterisations perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene. The filming and direction are deceptively simple but feel so natural and drew me completely into the story. My two favourite scenes are Bobbies birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end directed and edited to perfection. The quality and phrasing of Jenny Agutters voice when she calls: Daddy! My Daddy! wrenches emotion from the viewer. Tears are welling in my eyes as I think of it.<br /><br />This adaptation isnt just a movie it is a piece of precious art as well as being the perfect example of what all film makers should be striving to achievecreation of an emotional experience.',pos
'Famous as the British film so bad it had to be given away for free with a newspaper the quality of this sub-Childrens Film Foundation thriller can be guessed from the abnormal number of 10/10 votes it gets and the large number of rave reviews from posters with no posting history and no other reviews to their name. The regulars know what this mean the gullible might be conned. If they do dip into the waters of this one they wont last long before it drags them under. Technically inept with the boom mike getting into shot or the reflections of the crew visible it just goes on forever in a forgetful sub-DAVINCI CODE on $5 a day way. The end is just insulting but dont worry. Its not as if youll get that far!',neg
'The Bone Snatcher starts out extremely promising with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the African desert. Whilst checking pipelines out in the desert three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that devours their flesh and only leaves a pile of half-eaten bones. The expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a superiorly mutated ant-queen and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well. Director Jason Wulfsohn sustains a respectable level of tension just until the nature of the monster is identified. Immediately after that the film rapidly turns into an ordinary creature-feature with all the characters dropping out of the survival-race one by one. The second half of The Bone Snatcher is unendurably boring; with the inevitable love-story clichés as well as a complete absence of gory murder set pieces. The characters all are insufferable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance. Theres the rookie who has to prove himself the female with brain-capacity apart from her hot looks the obnoxious experienced guy who redeems himself at the end through self-sacrifice and  last but not least  who could forget the wise black guy who refers to the monster using all kind of voodoo names. Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space menaces of Alien and Predator. The ant-creature has infrared-vision and crumbles when shot at yawn! The movie actually just benefits from its unique setting and the handful of nasty images of decomposed bodies. This could have been a modest gem but instead its less than mediocre. Avoid.',neg
'A reasonable effort is summary for this film. A good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given other actors were just dreadful! A terrible portrayal. It wasnt very funny and so it didnt really achieve its genres as it wasnt particularly funny and it wasnt dramatic. The only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance. Target Audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages. A very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasnt as good and who the target audiences were etc. However Maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability.<br /><br />4.',neg

The dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things Colin Farrells character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers.<br /><br />I kept thinking Hey theres a reason why boot camp is tough. Its supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit. Theres no room for cocky attitudes and men who wont follow orders. I was rooting for Bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers. I would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with peoples feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit.<br /><br />--<br /><br />',neg
'When I first heard about this movie I eagerly went out to rent it believing (mistakenly) that it was one of those so-bad-its-fun movies and that I was in for a treat. I was wrong.<br /><br />For starters the pace is agonizingly mind-numbingly slow. The pace doesnt even begin to pick up until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie! The plot was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing. For those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere. This movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwise.<br /><br />Try Childs Play instead.',neg
'This plot had more holes in it than an OJ Simpson alibi! <br /><br />I noticed two Star Trek references in the movie and yet<br /><br />ironically we have a lead character played by Andy Garcia<br /><br />who is the antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy of The<br /><br />needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one. <br /><br />Lets just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of San Francisco at incredible risk. Michael Keatons character is almost as<br /><br />unrealistic as well. He neglects to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is angered when Garcia foils his<br /><br />attempt to kill a bunch of cops at once. The childs doctor remains in charge of her faculties even after been<br /><br />held hostage several times in a short expanse of time but<br /><br />put her on a wide walkway 5 stories up and she loses it. <br /><br />Andy Garcias child is something of an anathema in this<br /><br />movie. He is the most sympathetic and real character one of the movies bright spots. He furthermore utters a line that must have been the result of serendipity regarding fighting cancer that parallels Keatons motivation to escape. All in all the movie was not a<br /><br />complete waste (see From Dusk to Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money<br /><br />for that) but disappointing considering the talent on hand.',neg
'While the title Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead comes from an Irish proverb the film plays out like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess theyve gotten themselves into.<br /><br />The cast is well-assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman & Ethan Hawke playing the aforementioned brothers. Notable support includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other. Beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable.<br /><br />The story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve. The narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts. That being said the films unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy through and through. All in all a pretty impressive debut for first-time screenwriter Kelly Masterson.<br /><br />Sidney Lumets direction is well handled but Im more impressed by the fact that hes still directing at over eighty years old. I was less impressed by the score by Carter Burwell but it isnt a major distraction.<br /><br />In the end the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story & presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience.',pos
'Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30s40s and 50s you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white.

'You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a story. At first viewing its even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images. If after this opening you want to see the movie you will not be bored. You may even be mesmerized. The movie may be an emotional experience; it may be an intellectual experience; it may be both. Judging from the DVD commentary which is essential it was primarily an emotional experience for Herzog and at one point he talks explicitly about how the film is a collaboration between filmmaker and viewer. Theres plenty of room for the viewer to make of this film exactly what he or she wants to make of it. Take a gamble?',pos
'9 the film Ive been looking forward to for months.... was little more then a disappointment.<br /><br />I was deeply surprised by 9s lack of story and strange character development. All the awesome action sequences in the world dont make up for a single unsympathetic character. <br /><br />The strange almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists... why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices??<br /><br />How what when why.... questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater. <br /><br />A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth.... I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good. But the filmmakers have relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons name to draw in the crowd. Which... is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect.<br /><br />9 could have been awesome... with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from its own creators.',neg

The movie then shows some cryogenic freezers with Vin Diesels narration. Ive always thought his voice sounded cool ever since I saw Fast and the Furious. From when I found out he was as criminal I thought the movie was going to be cliche. It was. It was very cliche and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. Black out every 22 years. Lucky them they land on that day. Aliens can only be in the darkness hey its a solar eclipse. As much as I thought it was too easy and just a cliche the movie pulled through and kicked major @ss.

'So Todd Sheets once stated that he considers his 1993 shot-on-video Z-epic Zombie Bloodbath to be his first feature film. Anyone whos ever seen a little beauty called Zombie Rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is. I mean what makes this one that much more superior? Well then again Zombie Rampage doesnt include that mullet guy now does it? <br /><br />For one to comprehend exactly why Zombie Bloodbath is actually considered worth a damn one must remember what the 90s were like for lovers of bad horror. A decade that all but said goodbye to B and Z-cinema as we knew it. Technological advances awkward trends and the internet would abolish the mysterious charms of the s.o.v.s big-boxed golden years. And anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too self-aware for its own good basically defeating the purpose. Luckily not everyone changes with the times. Enter Zombie Bloodbath.<br /><br />And I guess this is the part where I explain the same exact premise from 500 other zombie flicks from the last 40 years. Alright so Some kind of accident at a nuclear plant infects everyone in sight turning them into flesh-eating zombies who go on a rampage inflicting some of the most gruesome yet humorous gore-scenes of the 90s. The first 20 minutes are cluttered with the most awkward-sounding conversations you could imagine. Conversations that let you know that this isnt just a low-budget zombie flick this is a Z-grade disasterpiece fella. plenty Hysterical non-existent acting to go around and that goes triple for Mr. Mullet. That guy is truly the highlight of the night.<br /><br />The fact that Todd Sheets seriously considers Zombie Bloodbath to be THAT superior to Zombie Rampage amuses me to no end. I mean really both are complete jokes on celluloid but then again so is Redneck Zombies so obviously Todd Sheets is in the company of awsomeness. By 1993 a movie this bad would no doubt be a full-blast spoof but Mr. Sheets stands his ground giving us some good old fashion schlock the way it was meant to be unaware clueless and pointless. God bless Todd Sheets. For anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile 90s B-Horror Leif Jonkers Darkness should be at the top of your list. As for Zombie Bloodbath if youre a gorehound who got bored sometime around 1990 then 93 would be the perfect time to pick up. 8/10',pos
'This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in Desk Set and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesnt care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in Nanny & the Professor. Unfortunately he died real young... oddly enough his last role was on the series Death Cruise. weird. Directed by Charles Lamont who not only directed several of the Kettle films he also did a bunch of the Abbott and Costello flicks so he must have known a thing or two about comedy. Fun story plain simple humor. Even the release date was April Fools day 1949. The story starts out by showing us what backward and country-folk they are (the neighbors are even Native Americans) but as the story progresses we have sympathy and respect for them.',pos

Once back in the United States she is not aware that she could be spreading the disease on everyone and everything she comes in contact with. Eventually she is pursued and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. Other than Keyes striking performance there is good support from villainous Charles Korvin William Bishop Dorothy Malone Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The finale is a humdinger with Miss Keyes on the ledge of a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators below. A good B flick!',pos
'I lived in that area (Hoboken and Jersey City)for about ten years. This film certainly captures the feel of that time and place. The dialogue is very good the music is right and scenarios realistic. As another poster said it looks almost like a documentary.<br /><br />I like the way it humanizes these kids who probably would have rather have been born in Westchester but fall into what kids fall into. It just so happens that area is pretty rough.<br /><br />They over-demonize the cops quite a bit but thats to be expected. Id say the acting is good all-around too.<br /><br />It gives the viewer some sense of how this idiocy is caused and gets blown out-of-proportion.

'I had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews. Then....<br /><br />Heres my additional two cents to the already posted excellent lost in translation review. Premise: Morgan is stuck in a dusty small town where he meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life?<br /><br />Realistic dialog? NOT. How about that shopping in Target. First Freeman looks at the Target interior as if hes walked into Harrods. Then hes bowled over at a T-shirt rack confirming he has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlets reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlets life.<br /><br />One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and ex-hubby fight scene where her survival a car in this instance requires she physically attack her ex hubbie. Does Freeman run to her defense....naw...hes cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real sorry lot in life. <br /><br />Freemans character believes a car wash and new very revealing tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlets job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freemans endless stage talk where all aspects of Scarlets reality are reduced to one or another stage related Freeman experience was irritating. <br /><br />Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis: uneducated no white collar skills or experience VERY POOR no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $100 for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills. In the end Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a starnot even paying for gas for Scarlets dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman cares not to know.',neg
'...but this just isnt working and I am surprised to see how many people consider it good. On what grounds? There are some loose hints here and there but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. Lynchs movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet are very playful when doing that. There is some visual sense there are some subplots characters ideas etc. But this is dull and yes pointless. Because whatever there is to explore is either to small either too far-fetched or simply told before in a superior manner. Its just Lynch exploring DV nothing more so it should be treated like this. 1/10',neg
'Between the ages of 30 and 51 when he died of a brain tumour Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulescos The Mask of Dimitrios where he played Dimitrios. The next year 1945 he made three films of which this is one. He is best remembered by cineastes as the star of Jean Renoirs The Southerner one of the 1945 films where he had a sympathetic role. However he often played creepy characters and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money. So what happens here? He lives in a house with three women so watch out! Faye Emerson who also appeared in Dimitrios plays the older of two daughters in the house. She falls in love with Scott and they become secretly engaged. Then her cute kid younger sister (played effectively by Mona Freeman who resembles Bonita Granville both in looks and in behaviour) returns from boarding school and reveals casually in conversation with Scott that she has inherited a tidy sum so Scott turns his sights on her instead with all the torrid jealousies seething in the household which that was bound to arouse. Things get tense and then they get tenser. Meanwhile plans for murder are going forward in the mind of the calculating Scott. But it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions. He is also being searched for as a result of his last kill with which the film has opened so that we know his back story. James Wong Howe gives effective noirish cinematography to this tale which was directed by Frenchman Robert Florey who had moved to Hollywood some time earlier. The film is an effective psychopath-in-the-house mystery which can cause a bit of wear of the edges of some seats for those of such an inclination.',pos
'When I saw this film on FearNet I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently it wasnt. I have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful from all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it. He breaks the seal and certain disasters happen. The water turns to blood the oceans die out the moon turns red etc. <br /><br />The female character was annoying as well. A lot of the stuff she did didnt make sense.

The mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child. She touches her childs head transferring her soul into the child and then dies. Then the apocalypse stops.<br /><br />Why does God all of a sudden have a change of heart? He gets furious when the Governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then hes all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby? <br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />The movie is pretty stupid.

'This eloquent simple film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father. Though a theatrical release it has a made-for-TV quality. We can attribute this to the director John Frankenheimer who learned his craft in the early days of live television in New York City. Indeed he directed the teleplay on which the film is based Deal a Blow on the CBS drama series Climax. Young Stranger represents his Hollywood debut. After a hiatus of four years during which he would do more television he returned to direct The Young Savages with Burt Lancaster and a year after that All Fall Down with Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury.<br /><br />The casting is competent with James Daly and Kim Hunter (particularly good) playing the parents of the title character performed by James MacArthur (his first theatrical film) who played the same role in the television version which was his first appearance on the small screen. Look for James Gregory and Whit Bissell in supporting roles.',pos
'No bullets no secret agents a story that is entertaining funny and believable. Met some of the producers/actors in this film at the theater. They seemed as interesting in person as their characters on screen. You may not hear about this movie on TV with high-dollar ad spots but it is definitely worth checking out. I have spent $8 for a movie ticket on a lot of other movies that werent this entertaining. Looking forward to future projects by this production company.',pos
'After seeing only half of the film in school back in November today I saw that it was on Flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it.<br /><br />The book that the film is based on Hatchet is OK. This is a terrible adaption of it though.<br /><br />Awful (and I mean awful) acting bad dialogue and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of Hatchet.<br /><br />The film starts off Brian who is the cliché image of a late 80s teen (sporting a mullet banging his head to cheap 80s rock music) and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged Dad (his parents are divorced...now cue the dramatic pause.) Now Brian has said goodbye to Mom and dog and is flying up to see his father. The pilot is a fat ugly rude man (wasnt like that in the book) who after 2 minutes in the air has a heart attack and dies. In the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack.<br /><br />The plane (within another two minutes) has gone empty on fuel (leaving us the viewers to assume that hes been up there for hours even though the sun hasnt changed position and the scenery looks EXACTLY the same.) Nows hes crashed landed.<br /><br />This is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book. In the book it said his jacket was torn to shreds but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips (looks like he just bought it) it never said he climbed a mountain saw a wolf and fell asleep up there on the mountain it never said he was attacked by a bear (it said a moose but not a bear) it never said he eats the several bugs that he does it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows skin them and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes (that is destroyed by one of the tornadoes) nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes.<br /><br />I dont even think you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado. All it was was just a windstorm that knocked down several of his things.<br /><br />My favorite part of this camp fest was Brians lame flashbacks (that are never mentioned in the book) especially the cliché scene of Brian waking up walking over to the window and seeing his Dad (with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck) leaving and screams DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD!!!! (yet of course his father didnt hear him even though he was just right outside) and he punches his fist through the window (wtf?) <br /><br />The ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book (I said close.) In the book I think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to Brian when he landed was youre the kid who theyve been looking for! They stopped months ago... yet they left that line out in the movie.<br /><br />Theres a pathetic epilogue with Brian (somehow without counseling or therapy) getting back to normal with his family. I think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter.) Then it shows his temporary home (for what in the movie seemed like three days but in the book was for several months) and his hatchet still in a tree where he left it (also didnt happen in the book) showing where he carved a message so perfectly done: HOME (where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet?) <br /><br />No quote can sum this movie up better then when Enid from Ghost World said this is so bad its gone past good and back to bad again. Perfect description of this movie.<br /><br />I wouldnt recommend it to somebody (who hasnt read the book) and are just looking to watch a movie nor would I to somebody who has read the book (because theyll be disappointed and bored to death.<br /><br />For those who have read the book leave what your imagination created as the movie. This is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book.<br /><br />1/10',neg
'I really enjoyed Random Hearts. It was shocking to see such a low rating on IMDB but chacun a son gout and all that. I am a big fan of Harrison Ford but I do have to admit that he was ill cast in this movie and the reason I gave it 9 instead of 10. Kristin Scott Thomas though was just wonderful. She was believable and beautiful in spite of being made up for half the movie like shed been crying for days. Could Random Hearts have been better? Sure but it is very much worth seeing as it is.',pos
'Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal Crocodile (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and Lake Placid. Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater-crocodile supposedly is 90 years old over 30 ft long (!) and it kills for fun! During the film he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer-dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark-congested area. The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location. Even though its a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this the lagoons and nature looks marvelous. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. Theres a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful to listen to! You wont believe some of the lines these actors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake theyre not that stupid! Early in the film one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a mechanical toy but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielbergs great white shark. The visual effects in Blood Surf are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I wont say too much about the acting since its secondary in flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad film. So bad it becomes fun again. But funny for a whole other reason than James Hickox intended.',neg
'Ever had one of those nights when you couldnt sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was on? That is how I ran across this tripe. For myself I would have been better served tossing and turning for the 97 minutes I wasted with this film.<br /><br />In its attempt to be real this movies characters come off as such gangsta stereotypes that the story should have been the premise for a Wayans brothers movie. The dialog? Please! It sounded like a white man was trying too hard to write this film.<br /><br />The editing was horrible. One of my favorite scenes involved a car chase down a bunch of narrow alleys. Cut to the characters being chased though and they are driving through a park complete with baseball fields in the background.<br /><br />When any of our homies get shot in this film he bleeds miraculously through clothes that have no holes which is more than I can say for the plot of this predictable load of....baking soda.<br /><br />Indie films can be great even if they are low on budget and effects but they still need to have some cinematic integrity. If I could have given it a 0 I would. If you watch it I hope it is on cable because even the cheapest rental would be too much to pay. Actually 97 minutes was too much to pay...',neg
'The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay Ive ever seen. Aside from the acting which is wooden no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows up the middle of roads and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready. The constant suicidal behavior set off my tilt switch so often I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had. This movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in Saving Private Ryan. Unless you are under 7 years old I recommend watching something else.<br /><br />GB',neg
'The cover of the VHS says it all: Without doubt the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Im a huge fan of 70s and 80s slashers and I have to say I agree 100 \%. The characters are believable the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). Theres the twisted atmosphere that only TCM has an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror. This has to be one of the most beautifully shot horror films of all time! Jeff Lieberman as a director of this 1981 low budget film does and excellent job and with his other works (Blue Sunshine Wrong Turn) added he must be one of the most underrated directors in the filmindustry today.',pos
'Harvey Keitals best performance so far the new century. Very nicely photographed a beautiful snap-shot of pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections. Its really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger much more complex world that he doesnt yet understand.the script is strong and filled with humor the direction is crisp. Over all a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately this just makes the film a little less convincing. But if you can see beyond this you will find a heartfelt trip to another world. Recommended.',pos
'We just saw this movie in Austin Texas at the Alamo South Lamar yesterday afternoon. It had me laughing out loud many times! The scene about Albert Einsteins thoughts on humanity hit me over and over and I couldnt stop laughing. Its too bad its not in more theaters I know a lot of friends that are dieing to see this movie! Welcome to Costco I love you. ... great work to all involved! Also if you see it make sure to stay until the end of the credits as well! Im going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure! If youre a fan of OFFICE SPACE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD then you have to go see this movie. Its a classic and no one knows that its out! So if youre in the mood to see something funny this weekend definitely check it out.',pos
'This show started out okay but then it turned into a nightmare. The worst part about it was the contestants. Most of them were weirdos. They did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies. In the second season one guy said he that he talked to his pants. That is sick and repulsive. Also no one cared about winning money. All they ever wanted to do was make alliances like it was Survivor or something. The men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together. The women were the same also. I just couldnt take it anymore. I had to stop watching it. It was truly one of the worst shows ever.',neg
'This movie beats everything out there. Well depends on what you are looking for... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. This movie is in a complete league of its own.. I dont think any movie could possibly come close to it. I am not sure what the director intended to make it as.. a thriller or a comedy. If he did think he was making a thriller then he has by a stroke of luck created one of the best bollywood comedies of all time. You have to see it to believe it.. a matrix + terminator + a host of other movies rolled into one along with a storyline dating back to 1980s Hindi movies with a icchadhari naag (a mythical snake which can turn into a human).<br /><br />Its an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side planning to laugh at the movie! I am not sure whether to give it a 1 or a 10.. On the basis of flipping a coin I have decided to give it a 1!',neg
'Outside the household is a different world and the family struggle to tread the line between Dads authority and their hopes and dreams.<br /><br /> The period is captured; The bakelite light swithes the Georgian floorpan the picture rails the wall paper the short skirts the cheeky lads the Mini van shiny modern mangles....<br /><br /> The location is captured; A wind lashed glacier hewn rocky landscape walls of local stone community freedom.<br /><br /> But there is much much more; Childhood happiness sensuality pride values freedom authority rebellion violence (in the deepest sense) love struggle puberty naivety morality trust faith deceit machismo manners maturity loss poverty sacrifice horror acceptence revelation comedy and parenthood are all there. (And in no particular order!).<br /><br /> This film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevent today as ever. The fact that some of these arent tackled directly is testament in itself to the attitudes of the day but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the acting skill the story and the direction.<br /><br /> If theres anything bad about this film its that all this deeply entrenched and wonderfully enacted tension is swept away a little too lightly towards the end. Maybe I missunderstand - the doom and gloom felt by many teenagers really does disappear if they deal with it (**) - maybe the film is trying to send even that message too - well worth doing.<br /><br /> What is the film trying to say? Kids: Parents were young too parents struggle too everyone makes mistakes everyone learns things change struggle can end happily. Parents: Dont try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well being.<br /><br /> It sounds simplistic doesnt it? Sometimes the film feels like that too but its then that you notice how much is being being challenged and uncovered.<br /><br /> The film is a classic.<br /><br />(**) - Not the problems themsleves.',pos
'Who doesnt know Largo Winch in the France-Belgium-Luxemburg trio (the three countries where the French BD or Bandes Dessinées are massively published) ? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels it HAD to be adapted on screens. After a first - and failed- attempt with a TV show the real thing begins.<br /><br />First of all and thats what most of the fans didnt get the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. Some essential parts characters and actions of the original are missing. The movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a 1st class-fan of the comic book I must confess I was nicely surprised. The actors are good so is the scenario though it might seem too fast. I thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financial/political thrillers but it is clearly not an alternative to James Bond or Jason Bourne series as I could read over the internet.',pos
'NOROI follows a documentary filmmaker Masafumi Kobayashi as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil thats leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake. After interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud babys cries coming from the house next door (where there is no baby) Kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor. Hes greeted with hostility by the unhinged disheveled woman (Maria Takagi) who answers the door (and promptly slams it in his face) and gets a peek at her 6-year-old son through a window. Strangely both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch) and the woman who first complained about the noises as well as her daughter are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that. This piques Kobayashis interest and he sets out on a quest to find out whats going on. He soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra-sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic. Well-known 10-year-old clairvoyant and TV celebrity Kana (Rio Kanno) seems to think we may all be doomed but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help. Another female psychic/actress (Marika Matsumoto) becomes involved as does Mr. Nori a mentally unstable kook/psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to ectoplasmic worms. Clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village thats now covered by a lake and the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba...<br /><br />Unlike many other hand-held horror flicks this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first-person scares. Thankfully theres something of a storyline here a very interesting and intricate one at that so it doesnt rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera-work every once in awhile to keep your interest. The way Masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth - with well placed jolts along the way - reminded me somewhat of THE OMEN in its pacing. The film also doesnt entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what were watching is an already completed documentary. That helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the actual footage either. Overall its a well-made horror film with lots of plot shifts some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments thats well worth checking out. My only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long. Otherwise pretty good stuff.',pos

This is a good movie but Chris Rock has done way better things than this. It will only make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie. And its not really laugh-out-loud funny.

Then there was the Yen Lo an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which Wendy was striving to win. It all ends like a typical feel good movie when Wendy and her Buddhist monk cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever) in the end. So Wendy learns a lesson...blah blah blah.

'It pains me to say this about an Australian film but Mr. Accident ranks with the worst of the worst films I have ever seen. Whats even more tragic is that it doesnt fit into the its so bad its good category. What annoys me the most about this film is the fairly large amount of money that has been frittered away on a pointless unfunny underdeveloped inept screenplay. Dumb performances (What are Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore aka Elle McFeast doing in this trash?) inadequate direction no plot and a general sense of meanness totally take away from the interesting production design and leave you with a truly horrible taste in your mouth. Comedy! Ha! Do yourself a favour and stay away!',neg
'As the number of Video Nasties Ive yet to see dwindles this little pile of garbage popped up on my to rent list when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip though if he returns with the girl and all the money he gets a significant cut. Hes brought a helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. Now this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever ping-pong balls for eyes and thats pretty much it. His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack and I found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />Oh did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned though there is one specific scene about one second long where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out but its not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals and sadly male as well. So if you want fair in terms of exploitation you got it.<br /><br />I cant recommend this trash to anyone. Its not even the good bad movie. Its just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then if you are making your way through the list leave this for the very last. If you watch it first you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list which is certainly not true.',neg
'I am an Australian currently living in Japan. I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of Western and Japanese ideologies colliding. Whoever wrote the screenplay and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what its like to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only part I thought was too Hollywood-y was when Tom Sellecks character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him. Public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. Finally a movie that highlights the true gaijin experience! 9/10',pos
'Being a music student myself I thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch. Little did I know... (I had no idea this movie was based on a book by Britney Spears) This movie was implausible throughout. Its obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesnt know a thing about classical music. Let me give you just a few examples: 1) There is NO WAY anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever! Just having a nice pop voice isnt enough besides thats a different thing altogether - another genre different technique. Its like playing the violin when applying for a viola class. 2) How come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury? If she wasnt a singing professor herself she would have no say in a situation like that and if she was a singing professor why werent we told so? 3) Being able to read music is a necessity if youre to major in music. 4) How did Angela get a hold of that video tape? That would have been kept confidential for the jurys eyes only. Now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didnt have a clue. I wonder which... 5) The singing professor gave Holly the Carmen song saying she had the range which she clearly did NOT. Yes she was able to sing the notes but Carmen is a mezzo-soprano while Hollys voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre not at all compatible with that song. 6) Worst of all: Not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music but it doesnt even try to hide it. The aria that Angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital where it is cut short in a disgraceful way - Mozart would roll over in his grave. The Habanera from Carmen sounded a bit weird at times too and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music - its stiff and boring but hey add some drums and electric guitars and its almost as good as Britney Spears! I know these are all minor details but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research. Anyhow I might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated. But without that I really cant find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one: its good for a laugh.',neg

The movie did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. <br /><br />One of the changes that I did not like the way that Lord Fenton was portrayed. It made no sense to make him out to be a bad man. The way that things ended between Lord Fenton and Scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate. <br /><br />There was also a lot less confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book. The movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two. A fine movie but I believe that it certainly couldve been better than it was had it more true to Alexandra Rippleys book.',neg

'As you can tell from the few comments posted here - mine may very well be the last youll see unless there is a big DVD-release or TCM plays it again ! - this is a kind-of Our Gang movie with a bunch of different kids. MGM certainly WAS the musical studio - if the musicians dancers and singers werent under contract they were on tap. Heifetz was one of the most expensive.....that does it for a little charity work !!! The fee he received in that era was unheard of. Another musical film with Jose Iturbi (Mexican pianist) featured about 100 kids playing some simple tune on 100 pianos......so those skeptics who think young children arent musical are mistaken: I was one.<br /><br />As all write Frankie Smith - good-ole American name - (Gene Reynolds) was the bad-but-good kid who is taken-in from the streets by the owners of a music-school. Can you believe that Walter Brennan (Prof. Lawson) of all those western movies was the man running the school? Joel McCrea (Peter McCarthy) and Andrea Leeds (Ann Lawson) were the bigger stars in They Shall Have Music with a host of well-known extras (many of whom went-on to become stars in their own rights). As others have commented almost all of the kids in the orchestra (actually The Meremblum Symphony from Los Angeles) made big successes of their lives either as musicians (for the studios) and other businesses.<br /><br />Sad to say there arent that many young-peoples orchestras today - a sad mistake. Parents with children in school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above water and many dont even know what is happening to the kids in school. Musical instruction can get to be pricey and almost EVERYONE would rather had a football-team.....<br /><br />This is the cheapest concert by Jascha Heifetz youll ever hear is contained in this movie.....in those days a quarter. His playing is brilliant even if he looks like hed rather be someplace else.....emotionless. By contract any concert by Yo-Yo Ma is so joyful it makes you want to run right out and buy a cello.....this guy is having a good time....like the kids in the street concert when they hoodwink Heifetz to play at their school.<br /><br />All of the orchestral numbers were played by the kids and they make it sound easy. I love this type of movie - their plots are so simple it doesnt take you two days to figure-out if you enjoyed - or understood - the movie at all. We need some new movies like this - cant do anything but inspire younger kids to play other instruments than guitars.......Bravo!',pos

'Im not sure how the IMDb weighted average came up with such a low rating on this film. It is in my opinion and by all other accounts an overlooked gem of a movie. Rip Torn is fantastic as the stubborn Noel Lord and Tantoo Cardinal superlative as his housemate. Torn and Cardinal are both underrated actors who are finally given a stage to work their craft on.<br /><br />Their relationship isnt always pleasant but its very real. This is NOT the humerous and touching love story its billed as on the DVD jacket. In the end it is a tragedy.

'John Candy. Need we say more? He is the main reason you should see this film. Most people dont realize how gifted he was as an actor. Witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk. Just a simple(subtle) facial change and off we go. There are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits. The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes as well as the great moment when John(in a trance) goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend-that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. Im sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude. It is but it is also very funny mainly because it is John Candy doing this bit. The story in general is pretty lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty(both SCTV alumni with Candy) are not given enough to do in the film. Levy has his moments especially filming the wedding at the end(think Rod Serling) and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone. Overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid. I give this one 4 out of 10.',neg
'An interesting pairing of stories this little flick manages to bring together seemingly different characters and story lines all in the backdrop of WWII and succeeds in tying them together without losing the audience. I was impressed by the depth portrayed by the different characters and also by how much I really felt I understood them and their motivations even though the time spent on the development of each character was very limited.

'I was blown away when I saw The Best Years of Our Lives. The acting script and Master William Wylers Direction(winner of Best Director in 1946)is Brilliant.<br /><br />This film is about three WWII veterans who come home from the war and are reunited with their loved ones but have to deal with the hardships of coming home from the war.<br /><br />The first man Al Stephenson(Played by Fredric March in his Oscar winning role) comes home to find his wife Millie(played by Myrna Loy) and children Peggy and Rob(played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) are more grown up and different than before he left for the war.<br /><br />The second man Fred Derry(played by Dana Andrews) has to find a good job and come home to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war. He begins to find out that she is not the same.<br /><br />Homer Parish(played by Harold Russell in his Oscar winning role)has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his familys and fiance Wilmas(played by Cathy ODonnell) reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands.<br /><br />All of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scenes. The stories of these men are all interwoven beautifully together.<br /><br />This film truly defines the meaning of a Classic. This unforgettable drama(winner of best picture in 1946) is a film that everyone should see.<br /><br />If I was asked to pick a favorite film this would be it!<br /><br />Out of 10 I would give The Best Years of Our Lives An 10.<br /><br />So next time you go to your local video store rent this movie you wont regret it!<br /><br />NO objectionable material a good family film.',pos
'Im not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when she was making this movie but it obviously had nothing to do with Richard Wrights novel which the movie is based on.<br /><br />We read the novel this past summer for AP English 12 and just watched the film. During periodic note-taking and checking of the clock I contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning. Of course the sky was completely clear and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie... and then write a 5-paragraph essay on it.<br /><br />Wrights novel discussed very real themes of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it. Silvers movie turned a murderer into a victim which is NOT what Wright wanted (see: How Bigger was Born 454).<br /><br />Im going to make this short and sweet: if you want to leave your consciousness in Raphael Lamberts words unsullied skip the movie and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not thought-provoking material.<br /><br />... ::sigh:: Now I have to write the essay.',neg
'A film with very little positive to say for it.<br /><br />Firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama.<br /><br />Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again. I lost count of how many times I had seen that field at night or that bit of cracked earth.<br /><br />It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience dont know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused. So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that its fine. We find Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre. Beth has a key to a warehouse of books? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie much later in fact too late.<br /><br />And on the point of the acre. Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary  and also if theyre meant to be an acre big then make them so.<br /><br />There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as Beth (the best performer in the piece followed by Jefferson  the cop) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on medication.<br /><br />With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child (did he crawl out of the window? Hes six months old) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene. Bad plinky plonk horror music fails to add atmosphere.<br /><br />Often bad films can be amusing but not The Empty Acre which is just bad.',neg
'This film shows up on the premium cable channels quite often and I find that I keep watching it over and over again. The performances are wonderful and the material has so much happening that there is always something new to take away from the film.<br /><br />Maybe I am too often distracted when watching films at home you know the drill the dogs bark the phone rings the popcorn finishes during the credits. But this film is about people and what motivates us what enlivens us what causes rifts between us and what inspires us.<br /><br />For me it is films like The Love Letter that keep me taking a chance on new films. Frankly I am surprised that the film is not better known. I would love to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in many more roles. They are a delight to watch. Kate Capshaw is wonderful and I had no previous idea that she would be. Ellen DeGeneres plays a role that is much more complex than simply being the comic relief.<br /><br />This film provides interesting visuals as a proper background to the characters and their interactions. I find it refreshing every time I take the time to watch it.',pos

'Rock n Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason it was so awesome was because of The Ramones! You couldnt have made the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols or The Clash in place of The Ramones it just wouldnt have been the same. dey young clint howard Vincent Van Patten Mary Woronov Paul Bartel and the hall monters just added to the movie. The whole entire movie is about The Ramones...especially Joey! So everybody showed see Rock n Roll High School if your a huge fan of real PUNK. Not the sissy new crap...but the loud and fast kind.

No concept of real life. I have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back. EVER!!! Everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed!!!!!! Im embarrassed for them! All of you should be ashamed. If i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by 5 years.

It looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie!

'Addictive is an adjective Ive heard many times when talking of certain TV shows. Most recently dramas like Lost Heroes and Prison Break have earned that description. However as compelling as they may be (and they really are) I can wait a few days before I see the next episode of either series even Prison Break which some have lazily classified as the new 24. With all due respect there can be no such thing and for a good reason: no other silver-screen thriller is based on a real-time structure. Thats what sets 24 apart from any other show and thats why I practically have to watch an entire season (on DVD) in seven days or less: once the frickin clock starts ticking its impossible to tune out.<br /><br />An episode whose events unfolded over the course of a single day was a trademark of NYPD Blue (and more recently Deadwood); having an entire season of a new series last 24 hours one per ep (the actual running time is 41 minutes; the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials when the show airs on telly) was the most groundbreaking idea in mainstream television since Hill Street Blues introduced non-linear storytelling (a mandatory element nowadays). And it truly paid off.<br /><br />Ironically enough the original plan for the series was to make it revolve around a wedding (fortunately creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran realized the format was more suitable for a conspiracy thriller) which is probably the reason the first glimpse we get of the hero suggests a cheerful atmosphere: looking extremely relaxed Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is enjoying a game of chess with his daughter Kimberly (Elisha Cuthbert) and minutes later being tender with Teri (Leslie Hope) the wife with whom he has just reconciled. As in The Sopranos though something unexpected and shocking is just behind the corner: not only has Kim snuck out of her room Jack also receives a phone call urging him to get to work immediately. At midnight? Im afraid so: Bauer is a CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) agent and his boss has acquired reliable intel about a possible hit on the life of David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) an African-American Presidential candidate who will be in Los Angeles for the whole day (oh right I almost forgot: events occur on the day of the California Presidential Primary). No time for napping then: Jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case. Unfortunately he has a tendency to ignore protocol and that doesnt sit well with George Mason (Xander Berkeley) a slimy man from Division who has been asked to interfere with the operation.<br /><br />The plot is very dense making the show hard to recommend for those with a short attention span but anyone willing to take a look will be rewarded instantly: the writing is sharp and precise the attention to detail unsurpassed and the suspense is consistently sky-high mainly thanks to the real-time trickery which considerably enhances the adrenaline level.<br /><br />Another great quality of this pilot is the characterization: most genre shows (sci-fi and thriller) tend to simply introduce the key players and then define them later on (a textbook example is CSI where character development is minimal but then again that matches the shows unique style) whereas the series debut of 24 offers a rich array of fully rounded people among whom Jack (Sutherlands best role - ever!) and Palmer (the real revelation of the show) stand out for being perfectly described after one episode only (the former divided between job and family reckless but humane the latter honorable and endowed with great integrity). A couple of supporting parts border on stereotype (Mason and Tony Almeida especially) but two factors ought to be taken into account: a) this is the first episode; b) theres so much going on most viewers wont even complain about a flaw or two. After all how many network programs manage to begin with a conspiracy a missing teenager AND a huge explosion - and still have equally satisfying material for the rest of the season?<br /><br />Tick tock tick tock...',pos
'Having just come home from my third viewing of The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought. I noticed a lot of Brits loved it while those in America just didnt get it. That really doesnt come as any shock as America doesnt get what English is.<br /><br />Wallace and Gromit are very English. Middle class English in fact with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure. The film is a lot like our two heroes; simple and unassuming. It has a nice and gentle plot so the children dont get lost yet theres enough beef there to keep the adults amused too. Theres some light innuendo (which seems have to have offended the evangelic - oh noes drama!) but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment. When people get offended by a plasticine anus you know the worlds messed up...<br /><br />One quick note to those (all American so far that I have seen) who think Chicken Run is a better film: Chicken Run was made to pander to your sense of humour and I think it suffered because of it. Curse of the Were Rabbit is witty English and intelligent. Thomas The Tank Engines film was ruined because it was made to please the Americans and Im glad Nick Park did not let that happen to another Great British institution.<br /><br />To sum up: You can keep your Chicken Runs your Shreks your Madagasgas - that kind of crude crass slapstick comedy just doesnt compare to the wit and grace that is Wallace and Gromit in Curse of the Were-Rabbit. English to the core and long may Wallace and Gromit stay that way.',pos
'I must admit that this is one of the few Lou Costello films that I actually saw in the theater. Most have now been seen on T.V. and I must admit that Lou is really enjoyable and he gets the girltoo. This was my first time seeing Dorothy Provine perform and of course I fell in love with her like so many others that day. I have seen most of the work she has done and enjoyed each one. Her performance in The Great Race is one of the reasons I bought the disc in the first place!<br /><br />Every comment on this movie tells that this is the one movie that Lou Costello did with out Bud Abbottwhich is truebut if Lou had lived he would have made many more. He really does a good job and doesnt have to rely on his old routines to get laughs. I for one am sorry that the little man from PattersonN.J. didnt get the chance to do that.<br /><br />I hope this comes out on DVD some time so I can add it to my comedy/sci fi collection.',pos
'This was a funny movie. Just having seeing the Evil Dead trilogy not a week ago (and left wanting for more) I got as many Bruce Campbell movies as I could including really bad ones. This one is funny without being exceptional but as sure as hell original.<br /><br />I mean youve got mad scientists superhuman cyborgs half brain freaks gypsies ex KGB cab drivers jealousy murders of passion love romance sex action and what more all with the same 6 actors :)<br /><br />You really have to see it and enjoy it I cant explain it in a text box. I guess it is not so much a cult movie as Evil Dead was but it certainly has that Bruce Campbell touch I love. Ted Raimi lends a hand Tamara Gorski looks both beautiful and interesting (she has gone a long way from the hooker in Friday the 13th) and Vladimir Kolev also shows a lot of promise as an actor although he will probably be cast as secondary character in Hollywood movies his entire career.<br /><br />Bottom line: funny movie. If you liked Evil Dead youll like this too.',pos
'1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Ridiculously lame 3D movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80s teen slasher flicks. Stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site become hunted by an unknown masked man and then we try to figure out who if anyone is going to live. We really dont care whos behind the mask but even thats not hard to figure out if youve seen any of these kinds of movies. What a waste of a 3D viewer despite somewhat decent 3D effects.',neg
'After watching this on the MST3K episode I have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run Farenheight 451 Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point I was really expecting Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /><br />I wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot. like the fact that even though gas is unavailable there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are located close enough together to keep an F1 race car going all the way across the country.',neg
'Its interesting that a novel with no plot has become the basis for two films. While The Heiress was a good if not entirely accurate adaptation Washington Square is a heavy-handed and poorly acted except for the part of Dr Sloper film that could have been so much better.<br /><br />The directors attempts at making beautiful scenes were so obvious that I actually cringed. It has none of the understated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have such as Onegin. I agree with other comments about Leighs portrayal of Catherine as an idiot instead of naive and shy; she made me despise her not feel for her.<br /><br />Catherines transition from childlike trusting to adult cynicism the whole point of the story was internalised just as it was in the novel. But we dont have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a film! I think someone skipped adaptation class at filmschool.<br /><br />I appreciate the directors attempts to make a moving and beautiful film out of a difficult text but it just didnt work.',neg
'I mean come on! This movie had such nice potential but its like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2/3rds of the way through. Characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didnt ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises. They also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be whats expected in this genre of movie. Its really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more.<br /><br />I was really hoping this would be a good movie. There was some good acting. Mark Hamill does an excellent job until the movie falls apart so does Sally Struthers. It was fun to see them working and succeeding at their craft. Majandra Delfino was pretty good for awhile until her lines just became untenable. I felt sad for her that she had to say these lines that just shot the whole movies credibility for any thinking movie goers. Brad Hunt does an excellent job. He really has a surprising range of talent judging from another of his movies I recently saw Lucky 13. (which was a piece of crap). This guy could be a star if he could pick the right scripts and get lucky with the right director.<br /><br />Almost forgot! The music was so heavy handed you might think this project was handed to some minor film school to be scored. I call this kind of music Teller Music because you can just tell whats coming next based on the music. Less is more sometimes.<br /><br />Cut half of the music from this movie get a good film editor a small rewrite or two and this would be a very good movie.',neg
'Im a big fan of 50s sci-fi but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie. Its clear he was working with no money because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever. I have *never* seen so much time-killing in a movie.<br /><br />There are probably less than 60 seconds of blob footage in the entire movie and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly-written run-on dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together but good heavens...how could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers?',neg
'The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (set by them also) where his face is scarred by acid. Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school (since closed) for a reunion. What they didnt know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them. Then a storm starts theyre locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />Pretty silly. The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school--but thats about it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (hes stripped has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt) and are just uncomfortable to watch. Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view. Also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity. There is full frontal of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but one girl decides to take a bath alone...AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them! And then theres the couple that has to have sex. This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them. It ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the TV! The acting is bearable--not good but bearable. Caroline Munro is in this too. Shes a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress.<br /><br />This gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere. Otherwise its run of the mill and forgettable. Scuddamores tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves.',neg
'The Secret of Kells is a film Ive been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. Im here to tell you now its been worth the wait. The cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as Id feared. The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination I particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page. The characterisation is superb I love Brendan Gleesons voice as the stern Abbot and I especially liked the voice of the sprite Aisling. The forest is a triumph such a beautiful place. The story is well realised a mix of fact and fantasy. and really draws the viewer in to cheer on Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book. Im a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart but all the people I know whove seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that its a lovely little film. I will definitely buy the DVD when its released and would like to say well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. May there be many more. :) Coming back in here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and gave them out at Christmas everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck in the world at the Oscars such a joy to see this nominated.',pos
'While the story is sweet and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the dream sequence. It features the combination of the highest form of truly American music (Gershwin) the engaging beauty of French impressionistic art Kellys enthralling choreography (including his rapturous pas de deux damour really a separate genre) with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set. Matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist.',pos
'I did a screen test and read the script for this turkey in 1988. It was awful then and even worse now - I spotted it on VHS at the local HollowWood Video and said oh what the hey for auld ang sine. Yech.<br /><br />They had to shoot most of it in Mexico after they ran out of money a couple of the stars pitched bitches because they ran out of some kind of exotic fruit drink crap. The movies plot is OK I suppose but I happen to know that the writer intended for it to have a spy catcher thread running throughout.<br /><br />Dr O ended up being a cartoon character. He must still be whirling in his grave over in the Kremlin Wall.<br /><br />Technical errors were all over the movie not only with the infant atomic technology but with the uniforms insignia and military jargon. They were too cheap to hire a professional military adviser of course. Even Mr. Newmans august and expert presence couldnt have saved this bird from being stuffed for Thanksgiving.',neg

Its nothing but another bad excuse of showing naked persons on the big screen. 4/10',neg
'I will admit that this movie was awful cheesy sexist badly dubbed and poorly edited but I loved it anyway. I first saw this movie when I was 14 and it has stuck with me ever since. FYI this is very close to hard-core porn as I remember. It certainly got my juices flowing. This flick gives a whole new meaning to swedish erotica. It is a humourous take on human sexuality as seen by hot randy female aliens who are I think just looking for some spermatozoa for their dying race.',pos

She was sad mean witty<br /><br />snobbish flirtatious delightfully funny loving tender sorrowful distressed happy etc. You name it she was all those things and more. -And so<br /><br />convincing. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio) who comes back to New<br /><br />Orleans and falls for a Texas gambler Gary Cooper (Clint).

'Julie Waters is always marvelous but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this wry gender-bent comedy about a transvestite who cannot suppress his obsession and the changes he goes through when hes discovered. Unerringly eschews the vulgar raucous easy jokes for genuine wit and true insight and has an absolute ball while doing it. A very nice low-key feel-good comedy',pos
'I consider myself a huge horror movie fan. One night I wanted to just rent some newer horror movies to make fun of. Then I rented Milo. I was so surprised by this movie. It scared the hell outta me. Thats not something I can say very often. Usually Halloween only scares me.<br /><br />Two other friends watched it with me and were left with a disturbed feeling. A good feeling if you ask me after watching a horror movie. If you are unaffected then whats the point.<br /><br />This movie was original. It didnt follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie. Thats why movies like Valentine bombed for me.<br /><br />Of course many are left with unanswered questions as most horror movies do. It is worth the rent though.',pos
'Ulysses as a film should in no way be compared with the novel for they are two entirely different entities. However that being said the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work but since it is a visual medium it is more difficult to pull of stream-of-consciousness. I think this is the best film they could have made with the material... and this is from someone that routinely rants about films not being like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book but the movie is still entertaining.',pos
'What the hell was all that about? I saw The Matrix and was amazed. It was the most spectacular movie ever made. What ever possesed the Wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond me.<br /><br />There is no plot you cant argue with that. Basically all this film was was a load of talking and dont get me wrong I have no problem with talky films but all the talking in The Matrix Reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle. Then there would be a fight sequence which lasted WAY too long then more pointless drivvle then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anti-climax ever. A little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes.<br /><br />Also Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance yet. I knew he wasnt a good actor but this was beyond a joke. If you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along. God knows what his performance is like in Somethings Gotta Give! Keanu Reeves: The only plank of wood ever to become an actor.<br /><br />After the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment. If you havent already seen the first film I suggest you watch it but dont waste your time with this utter pile of turd.<br /><br />',neg
'Yet another TV show becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays dimwitted agent Maxwell Smart in a movie thats so bad it makes the worst movie you ever saw become the second worst movie you ever saw. The seventh rate story- if you can call it that has a megalomaniac trying to take over the world. It is so unfunny it is absolutely pathetic. About the only thing Anne Hathaway does as agent 99 is look good-she seems incapable of doing anything else. Bill Murray has the fine sense to limit his screen time to about 90 seconds and a few faces from the TV series turn up in very small roles. Movie is supposed to be part thriller and part action film. It is neither. Even though I really was not a fan of the TV series at least it was light years ahead of this piece of -hit. All this does is drag it through the dirt and cheapen whatever good memories we had of it. Thank God Don Adams is not here to see it. Keep it up Hollywood! Keep making crappy movies like this and keep sendin em to the multiplexes on a weekly basis. No wonder the film industry is going down the tubes. This movie is so rotten its NOT even good for laughs. If this movie were a newspaper it could be used to line the bottom of a bird cage. There is absolutely no reason to see this movie. A root canal is more enjoyable than this.! Rating- zero minus five stars. Unless you are a Masochist STAY AWAY. Better still do what the title says- Get Smart and save your nine bucks. You will be able to buy about 2 gallons of gas with it.

I found the parts where the people out of the invisible loop saw people invisible. THere expressions were priceless Great film if the opportunity to ever see this arises I recommend seeing it for a good oh fashion laugh. My favorite character in all the Dexter series would most definitely have to be Dean Higgins I love his voice and hearing him get upset especially seeing his expression at the end was just pure hysterical for me.',pos
'This movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film. Dolph Friggin Lundren with a Japanese accent is funny enough but add really corny buddy-buddy action to the mix an eccentric and over-the-top villain a clichéd love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time and youve got yourself quite the little suicide-inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and up till watching Showdown had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch.<br /><br />I dont know if its just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia and not by females either. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each others manly parts and in fact before going on a suicide spree Brandon says to Dolphy In case we dont make it I want to tell you you have the biggest d--- Ive ever seen.<br /><br />Now is this what a normal man would say to another man? In an ACTION film no less? And would you want those to be your _dying words_??<br /><br />Later theres this gem:<br /><br />Dolph (regarding the villain): I would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy. Brandon: Man youve got a fixation. <br /><br />As the guy at RuthlessReviews.com pointed out Unfortunately Dolph doesnt respond with Ive got a fixation? Ive got a fixation?! Youre the one who decided that his last words should be about my privates!

'This film is worse than Cat People which I saw during the same week. It has all the 80s style. MTV punk rockers the real ones who are anti social not todays PC commercial type frat boys and a bad guy called Splater.

'Unless somebody enlightens me I really have no idea what this movie is about. It looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it. This movie tells pointless story of a New York press agent and about his problems. And that´s basically all. When that agent is played by Pacino one must think that it must be something important. But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is. To one of the best actors in the world Al Pacino this is the second movie of the year (the other is Simone) that deserves the title the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year. So what´s going on Al?',neg
'I acquired this one of my all-time favourite films on DVD recently and as usual during viewing the whole thing just blew me away.<br /><br />I am a massive fan of Hazel OConnor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears especially the Will You track. Its a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This rates second best to Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />A great soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80s in which I grew up. The ending is so sad for hours after the end of the film I am like a blubbering baby.<br /><br />I expect to wear out this DVD from repeated viewing I can watch it over and over again and never be bored simply for the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Hazel sorry to hear about your dad darling.

The next thing you hear is Karens amazing beautiful voice and the owner does a priceless double take. Nicely done! For some reason I have never forgotten that scene.<br /><br />The Karen Carpenter Story chronicles the meteoric rise of the Carpenters and Karens struggle to overcome anorexia. A lot of things are glossed over. This isnt a documentary and the movie left me with a lot of questions. Very little is mentioned of Karens solo venture (the CD was released only a few years ago. If you buy it you will wonder why they waited. Its some of Karens best work. The songs arent as timeless as her work with brother Richard but it was a great recording in my opinion).<br /><br />I have heard it said that you can be listening to a cheap time-worn little radio in the middle of the Third World that would seem to produce more static than anything else. But when a Carpenter song comes on the radio you would think you were listening to a $1000 Hi-Fidelity unit.<br /><br />Watch this movie!',pos
'Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul is one of the best music documentaries that I have seen lately and is more than a film about music. It is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city one of the greatest city in Europe and the world one of the most important cities for Europe history and for Islam the city that may bridge in the future Europe and the Middle East or may signify once again as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds.<br /><br />Then there is the music. The interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music and we hear a lot of (good) rock and rap in the first third of the film. An then like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots to Turkish traditional music to commercial romances and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflict ridden country as Turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects like censorship introduced by the military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the Kurdish one. One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedral-shaped hamam (Turkish bath).<br /><br />One gets to love the city and its music by the end of the viewing and hearing of this film. I have never been to Istanbul but after having seen this film I am sure that I want to visit this place soon.',pos
'Usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesnt have a lower rating and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating. This is not the case here.<br /><br />Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 film. It does nothing right and it doesnt have the chance to because it doesnt really attempt to do anything. There are strands of a bad D&D novel kind of plot which doesnt hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout. It is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort because even a completely patently untalented persons hard work would amount to more. A truly awful film.',neg
'A bumbling error at the Ministry Of Education results in Nutbourne Boys School having to share with St Swithins School For Girls. This bemuses the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all manner of chaotic goings on however the two are forced to come to an uneasy alliance in the hope of averting major trouble.<br /><br />The Happiest Days Of Your Life is based on the John Dighton play from 1948 with Dighton writing the part of Headmistress Whitchurch specifically for Margaret Rutherford. Replacing George Howe from the play in the role of Headmaster Pond is Alastair Sim and here in lies the crowning glory of this filmic adaptation Sim & Rutherford are perfectly wonderful bouncing off each other to keep what is basically a one joke movie highly entertaining. Directed by the gifted Frank Launder and produced by the equally adroit Sidney Gilliat The Happiest Days Of Your Life is a quintessentially British movie obviously a precursor to the St Trinians franchise the film entertains the children with its high jinks clash of the sexes heart whilst tickling the watching adults with its very saucy undercurrent. Thankfully the chaotic ending cements all that has gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin as wide as Nutbourne Rail Station great fun 8/10.',pos
'Norm(an)ally I dont mind remakes. There are some pretty good ones out there BUT this one is a stinker! Considering it was practically scene for scene it had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Als direction virtually flawlessly and it added color (Im not one of those who think it has to be B&W to be classic). It should have been at least a mediocre movie... but it was pee-pee caa-caa! I dont understand how it could have been screwed up so badly. If you must watch it as a curiosity but I would suggest that you not bother.',neg
'I am a new convert you might as well say. I borrowed the dvds from my local library. I have been interested in samurai since watching The Last Samurai. My dad told me he used to watch Shintaro when he was a kid. He said that it was pretty good. We are up to series 3. I absolutely love it. It takes a little to get used to the dubbed English voices over the characters speaking Japanese but I really enjoy it all the same. It is a little strange to watch the slight pauses when the ninja stars are thrown at characters and they stick into a tree or wall. I was not used to this but I am now. But I suppose thats the technology they had in the 60s. Ive noticed that Shintaro is kind friendly willing to help those in need hes very humble most of the time he doesnt big note himself (he only says he is better than the enemy ninja). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. Its really interesting to watch the swordsmanship that Koichi Ose has. It is amazing. This series is for anyone who are interested in samurai.',pos
'I was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive Paramount chain of vaudeville houses. This Paramount has a Mighty Wurlitzer organ  also magnificently restored -- that was used to accompany the silent films of the day.<br /><br />We were fortunate enough to have Dennis James a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the Mighty Wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film. The print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />This was Greta Garbos first American film. She was only 20 years old but already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire.<br /><br />It is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star; even though the Mighty Wurlitzer added immensely to the mise-en-scene it was necessary to leave much to the imagination.<br /><br />Modern audiences for the most part do not understand silent films Acting was different then with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions. Therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times  the acting is seen as hammy and over-done  but it was simply the style of the period.<br /><br />Garbo with all her subtlety did much to usher in the new age of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug. She exemplifies the truism that `a picture is worth a thousand words.<br /><br />Even though this is Garbos first American film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands: This was MGM filmmaking at its best. The sets and costumes were magnificent. The special effects  which by todays standards are pretty feeble  were still electrifying and amazing.<br /><br />The script by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from the novel by Entre Naranjos) would seem to be tailor made for Garbo; it showcases her strengths magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our part.<br /><br />Her co-star was MGMs answer to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film: allow himself to look unnactractive appear foolish and to grow old ungracefully.<br /><br />There are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted  especially when you consider the powerhouse that was Garbo. Notable among them are Lucien Littlefield as Cupido and Martha Mattox as Doña Bernarda Brull.<br /><br />This is when the extraordinary cinematographer William H. Daniels met Garbo  they went on to make 20 films together. (He was the cinematographer on 157 films and his career spanned five decades!) He was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known: The Divine Garbo. Without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she was.<br /><br />Seeing this film is an all-too-rare opportunity: if you ever have the chance do not miss it.',pos
'Feast of All Saints? Where...? When...?<br /><br />Was the Feast of All Saints storyline and theme edited out? <br /><br />What a waste of a wonderful title! There is never anything in the story that has the remotest connection to the Feast of All Saints. Nor is there anything in the story about All Souls Day which the term is referencing. Why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about All Souls Day or the Feast of All Saints? <br /><br />Embarrassly Bad Script & Amateur Writing <br /><br />How did they attract such great talent to this clunker? The writing is so amateur--characters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience. Not at all the way people talk to each other. <br /><br />What was the Director Thinking?<br /><br />The directing is equally bad! The forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish. In one scene a character is yelling Take your hands off of me and NO ONE is touching him! The most badly directed scene however is the incredibly over-the-top battle scene at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Excessive Gore in a Very Fake Silly Battle Scene<br /><br />There are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene. It looks like a Saturday Night Live skit!! You can see extras waiting for their cues to walk across camera. Everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys--exaggerating every little gasp and twitch. The blood on battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes.<br /><br />This whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline.<br /><br />Who in Real Life Would Ever Behave this Way?! <br /><br />The most ridiculous bit of writing directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene: <br /><br />A little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father--who is terribly mutilated and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds. Even a totally idiot would know he is dead! Yet she is--very monotonously--repeating over and over Daddy daddy... while looking at someone off-screen. She delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non-actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day.<br /><br />Even if the poor kid had any acting skills the scene is completely unbelievable. The little girl wouldnt even BE in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage--surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies while she calmly stands there!! Natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified running AWAY from the bloody carnage! <br /><br />Are we Suppose to be Horrified or Laugh...?!<br /><br />One particularly goofy detail that gives the scene an SNL satire tone is the father hanging with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek. He looks like a fish on a hook! The unintentionally funny details make the whole scene come across as fake and silly.<br /><br />In Fantasy La-La-Land Mothers and Daughters are the Same Age! <br /><br />Another funny detail is that you see a central character--the little girls mother--at the end of the scene and in the next scene that occurs 20+ years later she looks exactly the same! She is still young and beautiful and now the same age as her daughter! <br /><br />I almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful--but I tried to stick it out because I wanted to see the Louisiana settings and I like all the actors. I dont know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles!<br /><br />Who was the Targeted Audience?<br /><br />The excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows. It is also a strange way to start a movie that for the rest of the time seems targeted to romance novel reading females. Weird inconsistency in tone!',neg
'WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS AS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE!!!<br /><br />Okay if you havent figured out the plot yet I am going to give it to you. Two couples head out to a camping site but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhem.<br /><br />Now it is time for me to give these couples some advice.<br /><br />1. Never ever go to camp dubbed Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Dont have sex or make out in front of the killer. 3. Dont go chasing after the killer if he or she runs away. 4. Dont yell profanity at the killer. 5. Make sure your cellular phone works before you go camping. 6. Everybody needs to bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it on themselves at all times. 7. Wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes. No tight and binding clothing and no high heels or sandals. 8. Wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them so you dont stab the wrong person. 9. Always carry your car keys on you. 10. Put out a camp fire when you go to bed. 11. Watch your step. If you trip on something your going to break a bone. 12. Check the backseat for uninvited guess. 13. If the killer has you cornered at least put up a struggle.<br /><br />And guess what? At least one but usually all four of the main characters breaks all of these common sense rules. They are the dumbest characters ever to grace a film.<br /><br />Now for some brief comments. This slasher film was on a very tight budget. So low four of the 7 or 8 actors play more than one role. The acting writing direction sound lighting camera work plotting editing etc. are all bottom of the line. But like the classic film JACK O this works on a sooooooooo bad it is very entertaining and campy fun level. So rent this and have a good time and laugh. My rating: 5 out of 10.',neg
'As I have said before in previous comments some programmes are there to be Light entertainment. So I get somewhat frustrated when commentators seem to be expecting a program that will reveal the meaning of life you will not get that from Cleopatra 2525 and it does not presume to offer it. What you get is a girl who was frozen and is brought back to life some 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. She does not settle in within 10 minutes as what happens with other time travelling adventures and neither is she the female equivalent of James Bond ready to take on all comers.Cleopatra is overawed by her new surroundings and frightened by some of the weaponry on display as most of us would be. However it is light entertainment the stories have a beginning a middle and an end in quick time and their are some surprisingly good moments of acting. The episode when there is a double of Cleopatra is particularly moving and Jennifer Sky I think gives one of the best performances of someone dying for a long long time and being a film and television buff I know what I am talking about. Finally to prove my sincerity I have purchased all but four of the episodes and I am entirely satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I do not have the complete set is because I purchased the other episodes before realising that there was one complete box set. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio creditably and for light entertainment Cleopatra 2525 certainly entertained me.',pos

'Yep. Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. The 80s Joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. Well written stories well developed characters. Granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line. Fast forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs. Venom. The animation was average at most. The movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like. The movie felt more like a Small Soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force. Then we have character development or lack there of. Dusty likes to be all Dusty? Slice and Dice like to do things together? What? Did the writers take a writing course on how to develops characters with the depth equivalent of Jar Jar Binks? As for the story. I like a bit of Sci-Fi. But that whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army has been done to death in the Joe universe. Mega Monsters or Toxo-zombies anyone? But I give the creators credit for trying to make the fan boys happy by having martial arts action every 10 minutes. Im not a huge fan of SE and SS but I did like the fight scenes between the two. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is you will enjoy it. I admit to not being able to appreciate VvV as I should. Again everything Joe gets compared to what ways done in the 80s and honestly nothing will ever compare to the glory days of GI Joe. If you can appreciate VvV for what it is you will enjoy it.',neg
'Very slow-paced but intricately structured and ultimately very touching. A nice very true-to-life look at a small Florida beach town in the dead of winter -- Ive been there and this is absolutely accurate.<br /><br />Its also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd and she makes a big impression here. Its hard to believe this film is 12 years old -- I remember seeing it in theaters and I recently rented Ruby again. Except for the 80s looking clothes it has held up very nicely. Ashely is so radiant and touching here that its hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing. Boy talk about failing to fulfill your early promise! Anyone seeing Ashley here in Ruby In Paradise would assume this elegant natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting -- instead she has become the go to girl for dumb action films and slasher movies! Very disappointing but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise.<br /><br />As some other commenters say this is not for everyone as its very slow paced. This is not an action film nor is it really a romance. The director (Victor Nunez Ulees Gold another excellent character study) treats this ordinary young womans life with deep respect allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail. In that way I think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming-of-age stories about young women that I can recall -- its not about Rubys sexual awakening or how she lost her virginity but about her life choices and her growing maturity.<br /><br />A lovely film if you take the time to watch it...I think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls (or boys for that matter) and give them a chance to think about and discuss it.<br /><br />Particular kudos to director Nunez who also wrote the script which is so realistic and nicely detailed that I assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female-written novel or memoir but in fact its Mr. Nunezs original work. Rated 8 out of 10.',pos
'What a muddled mess. I saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open-minded to the many wonders of cinema but this sure isnt one of them.<br /><br />While there very well could be some good ideas/concepts and there are certainly some good performances (under the circumstances) it is all buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as Natural Born Killers U Turn and similar films as far as the editing is concerned or maybe he watched himself in Nixon for inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch but at least he more often than not has a method to the madness.<br /><br />His quote of stating that he made the film as a joke says it all. Its not worth your money bandwidth or time.',neg
'A four-and-a-half-hour ONeill play gets boiled down to a little under two and much of that running time is devoted to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their characters thoughts in voice-over. It can work onstage but it looks hilariously stilted in this soap-opera adaptation which soft-peddles its heroines bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland overacting ludicrously are outclassed by a naturalistic Clark Gable--hes the only one who makes the frozen-face technique work. It gets even funnier when Shearers and Gables son a surly moppet does the frozen-face shtick. There are also Frank Morgans brother Ralph as an unsuccessful suitor given to soliloquizing poor Charlie! over and over again and a young Robert Young and Maureen OSullivan. By the time they show up the voice-overs have largely been abandoned and it plays as a ripe soap with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays Silver Threads Among the Gold as background music. Robert Leonards direction is stodgy and he shows little facility for reining in hyperactive actors. Its certainly entertaining--theres nothing else like it unless you count Grouchos satirical parody in Animal Crackers or an old Mad Magazine satire that rendered Shirley Booths sitcom Hazel a la Strange Interlude. But it isnt good.',neg
'Forever Strong is a type of film weve seen many time beforejust in different types of genres. However that being saidI really thought it was a great filmSean Faris is showing the type of potential that usually lands actors into big time stardom. Apparently this film got a limited release as I wasnt even aware of itbut I saw it in the video store and decided to take a chance with it after I remember enjoying Seans performance in Never Back Down. I ended up making a great decisionIm not a fan of rugby what so everbut the film really isnt fully about rugbyits about making a stand in youre lifechallenging yourselfreaching your goalsthere is a whole lot more then the simple plot suggests. At 1st we dont give a damn about what happens to Rickhes mouthyfull of himselfand completely arrogantwe feel hes completely sealed his fate as a trouble maker. Along the way we see the changes in his characterhe starts to hang around with better peoplehe starts to better himselfwe learn how much negative impact his father has had in his lifeits just a great swerve and the film did a great job of turning Rick from cocky prick to a good hearted person.<br /><br />The rugby action itself is not too bad at allunlike the stuff I played and saw in high schoolthis was actually quite fun to watch and beautifully choreographed. A great young cast combined with some veteran experience helped this film immenselyit just did a fabulous job of avoiding in what couldve been a run of the mill type of thing to a poignant and effective drama. I also liked the conflicting contrast between The Coach|Garry Cole| and Rick|Sean Faris|it made for a very interesting storylineand I loved seeing him help out Rick along the way it was emotional and heartwarming at the same time. This is a real hidden gem that im truly glad I discovered it made me think about my life and a lot of times I need something like that.<br /><br />The Performances. Sean Faris is outstanding as Rick Penning. He reminded me an awful lot of a young Tom Cruise cocky yet very charismatic and talented. It was a tough role to turn going from a mouthy teenagerto a good hearted young manbut Sean pulled it off with pure perfection. He clearly put his heart and soul into this filmso big kudos to Sean for putting so much effort into this great film. Gary Cole is excellent as the preachy yet likable coach who wants to help out the kids. Ive always found him to be likablehe always has a sort of presence he carries to his films. Neal McDonough is fantastic as the selfish yet pressured father of Rick. For the majority of the moviethe script leads you to believe hes nothing more then a selfish bitter man who wants Rick to be exactly like himbut in the end you start to see the real him come outI felt sorry for him a bit. Julie Warner is a good character actress and she plays the good heartedyet clueless mother well. Penn Badgley is required to play a real jerkand boy does he ever do that well. On numerous occasions I wanted to pop him oneso I must say its a great performance. Arielle Kebbel is the love interest not much of a partshe did OK. Nathan West plays a somewhat mysterious characterhe did quite well. Sean Astin is billed as a major player for the filmbut he barely does anythinghe did good with what he had to do.<br /><br />Bottom line-Forever Strong is a great feel good filmit will definitely make you stop and think about how your life was much better then you thought. Dont let this one slip you byyou wont regret it.<br /><br />8 1/2/10',pos

CatDog is one of the examples.<br /><br />Its hard to write a negative comment without bashing the show but in truth Weekenders is pure garbage. It revolves around A group who with an over active Brain. The catch though is anything he thinks up comes bad. It may sound good on paper but after watching it youll realize how far from good this show is.<br /><br />The Pizza Guy is an extremely dumb character. Hes very 1-dimensional theres really not much to him. Hes hyper-active end of story. Though many feel all the character are a rip off of the South Park I think just the contrary. Mechazawa from cromartie High-School is an interesting character and hes able to make me laugh. Tino fail to do either of the two.<br /><br />The cast for the show isnt any better. Like Tinos Mom they suffer from lack of character. They only stick to one characteristic and thats it. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the show can cause you to smirk. Whether its that the scene may actually be funny or you may just smirk because how stupid it is.<br /><br />Thje Weekenders is a very crappy show from Disney/4kids.

'First off this is an excellent series though we have sort of a James Bond effect. What I mean is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006 it is chronologically the first adventure of 007 Dr. No (1962) being the second while in Golden Eye the first film with Pierce Brosnan Judi Dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male M so how could she have been in place in the beginning before Bond became a double-0 aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older? This is more or less a poetic license to thrill. We need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained. No the new Star Trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago. In the 1960s communicators were fantasy. (now we call them cell phones) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons. OMG do you think 400 years from now they would have perfected Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? So please lets give the producers some leeway.<br /><br />But to try and make things a bit consistent let us just ponder about the Cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of Battlestar Galactica. If that is the case where did all the Cylons that populated the original earth come from? We know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. Well what happened if one of the Cyclon ships at war with the Caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship loaded with human-looking Cylons wound up not only jumping through space but through time back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Earth One. They colonized it found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves but not before they themselves sent out a ragtag fleet to search for the legendary Caprica only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet which they colonized to become the humans who eventually invented the Cylons. Time paradox? Of course. Which came first the chicken or the road? Who cares? Its fraking entertaining!',pos
'Im not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if youve seen cult director Richard Kellys previous films Donnie Darko and Southland Tales you know thats gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see. I for one could only comprehend roughly 40\% of what I saw on- screen and even then it can only be called interpretation. So why did I give this movie a generous seven stars? Because for one we get some spectacular performances (Marsdens great and Langella returns as a familiar creepy character) and most importantly two because its entirely original and Richard Kelly undoubtedly one of the bravest directors alive uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. Quite frankly its the ONLY way - only through Kellys unique style could this story be told the way its intended.<br /><br />In the end if youre not willing to spend some serious thought into an intelligent movie (and even then it may all amount to nothing) stay FAR away from this one. But if you want to watch a deep rich complex and thought-provoking piece on spirituality existentialism and the predictability of human nature go see this. Be prepared for lengthy discussions with your partner however.<br /><br />*Note: If by chance youve read this review taken my recommendation have actually seen the movie and STILL believe youve wasted 2 hours of your life Id be happy to share my views on the whole meaning and plot of the film. See thats why I liked it so much - it promotes discussion! As hard as it is though Ill try summing it up by paraphrasing a rather depressing quote by Langellas character who explains the significance of the simple box to an employee: Your house is a box which you live in. The car that you drove to work is a box on wheels. When you return home from work you sit in front of a box with moving images. You watch until the mind and soul rots and the box that is your body deteriorates when finally you are placed into the ultimate box... to rest under the soil and earth.',pos
'This film is a good companion to Blair Witch because it does so much wrong that BW did right. Like BW this one pretends to be a documentary of ghostly events with each member of the team manning his/her own camera. <br /><br />The sense of reality is never there however. The participants are poorly written clichéd characters and the events that take place are equally clichéd (the cat jumping out of a closet falling chandelier etc). Also the stilted dialog and inept improv work by the overly-attractive cast detracts from the docu feel. AND worst of all the supposedly participant-held cameras record too many events too perfectly to be even remotely believable. Actually with some re-editing this thing could have been a Blair Witch parody. In fact there is a scene in which the blond historian is eating a sandwich with a huge roach on it that is actually pretty funny as is reminding me of a similar gross out scene from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. But in the end the event is played straight with no punchline. Its hard to tell what the intent was with The St Francisville Experiment other than to glom a few stray BW bucks. But its pretty sad when the only real interest I could find in it was whether the blond historian was going to have her t-shirt tied up off her belly in a particular shot or not.',neg
'A wonderful surprise of the Spanish cinema. I never thought Jordi Molla could be such a great director after all I really dont care much for his choice in movies. However this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all... something I ALWAYS enjoy! It hasnt enjoyed much good press and I really dont think itll ever be released in the US market. Well have to content ourselves with the DVD or VHS if even that... I dont want to say much about the story because I dont want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it (like sooooooooooo many) before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on.',pos
'This is a lame comedy.<br /><br />Heres why: A man and wife sitcom. Okay.<br /><br />The Husband is a douche bag. The Wife is the Einstein.<br /><br />How original is that? <br /><br />Jerry Stiller is just the same guy on Seinfeld.<br /><br />The gags are lame. No witty one-liners.<br /><br />I have had enough. Stop this now.<br /><br />The Last Word: Stupid. The destruction of the average white guy continues on ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. He just isnt here. Leah Remini is great eye candy but is unlikeable. Wasted talent is the word. Bad sitcom.',neg
'The Toxic Avenger Part II starts with the startling revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura who was apparently fired during production & replaced with Ron Fazio) had rid his home town Tromaville of evil it actually became a nice place to live. This meant that Toxie had no use as a superhero anymore & now suffers from depression & a feeling of utter uselessness (just like directors Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz should feel like after producing this) Toxie now works as a concierge at the Tromaville centre for the blind. Its not long before trouble rears its ugly head though an evil chemical producing company called Apocalypse Inc. plans to take over Tromaville for some stupid insignificant reason or other but to do so they need to get rid of Toxie. After the evil chairmans (Rick Collins) first plan fails he bribes Toxies psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan & see his Father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere) his Mother (Jessica Dublin) & his home behind Toxie heads for Tokyo Japan. Once there Toxie sets about finding his Father & a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) helps him in his quest. Meanwhile back in Tromaville Apocalypse Inc. move in for the kill & without Toxie the citizens are powerless to defend themselves. Toxie eventually finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka) whom he has been lead to believe is his Father however Big Mac is all part of Apocalypse Inc. plans to destroy Toxie once & for all...<br /><br />Produced & directed by Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz this follow up to the successful The Toxic Avenger (1985) basically proves the first film was a complete fluke a lucky accident to combine the right blend of bad taste comedy outrageous violence & so-bad-its-good film-making The Toxic Avenger Part II is a load of crap in comparison. The script by by Kaufman Phil Rivio & Gay Partington Terry with a load of additional material credits does not contain one single funny moment during its entire 102 (uncut directors cut) duration. The visual gags are terrible Toxie walking through Tokyo with a wig & glasses to blend in for instance or a scene where he heats up a bath with a bad guy in it & as he cooks Toxie throws in a load of vegetables & spaghetti a scene where he sticks electrical wires up a womans nose sticks an antenna in her head & a microphone in her mouth to which a Japanese radio announcer talks into a bit where a Japanese bad guy has his nose burnt into the shape of a fish a bit where Toxie grabs a swordfish head & uses it as a weapon or the embarrassingly bad overacting & stupid idiotic facial expressions a guy who literary has a fish for a head & gets turned literary into sushi the awful comedy music & sound effects & the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original mildly amusing & memorable. The bad taste gags arent there this time round & the silly childish juvenile humour of the first is also missing it just feels like a real step back from the original & lets not forget this is Troma here so that is most definitely a bad thing. There are a few gory fights & some serious gore & violence at least in the supposedly uncut 102 minute version I saw crushed heads with the bodies spurting out blood smashed faces intestines roses poked in someones eyes & thorns wrapped around their throat ripped off ears severed arms & a very graphic & gory scene of a man being chopped to pieces. Unfortunately the special effects by Pericles Lewnes arent particularly convincing & come mostly within the first twenty or so minutes. The acting is of embarrassing proportions as Ive already mentioned. Action wise there is an ultra cheap looking car chase at the end & a few unexciting lacklustre fights utilising cardboard ninja throwing stars at one point. Horror wise there is nothing a few gory set pieces apart. Comedy wise this is very unfunny. In fact The Toxic Avenger Part II sucks on all levels really & to top it all off its atrociously made as well most of the cast appear to be people plucked from the nearest street corner continuity is none existent cinematography is basic point & shoot & the special effects are anything but. One or two gory scenes apart this is total crap plain & simple do yourself a favour watch the original again instead.',neg
'Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web. This one is a good portrayal although I do not agree with it entirely. Taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.<br /><br />Ram Gopal Varma (RGV seems like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... Im not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara.. both are good! The former has better acting talent although the latter is catching up nicely.<br /><br />Anyways I like Antharas character. She is true to her art not touched by any unnecessary emotion and definitely not too practical. She is a dance scientist actually she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would offend her. Hey.. Donald Trump.. maybe you gotta ditch Melania here is Anthara and youve already built a Taj Mahal... aint this easy? Abhishek on the other hand is a practical fellow who wants money power fame etc. Hence these two albeit were struggling to get a break into the film industry cannot get along given their different styles and approach to life. This is very typical but what I like about the movie is that it says what an Abhimaan would say in its total runtime in one scene! Whats new? This movie takes a different angle to the film industry and how different people get into it. There is always something different about RGVs movies this one is different too it is way too slow for his standards. In parts it drags one almost to sleep.<br /><br />Noticeable It is tough to notice anything other than Anthara in the first half of the movie. I think this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved :-) Also looks like Anthara is a pro in Yoga she is way too flexible almost like a Prabhu Devi. Aby Baby is improving as an actor with every movie. I am sure his filmstar blood is paying off rich dividends. The title song was really good the music overall was above average.',neg
'Only a handful of the segments are engaging here. A segment with a garage attendant from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent & Bob Hoskins makes its point twist by twist until the final shot overplays things. <br /><br />The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke Paris. The others are so scatter-shot in theme tone volition & production that you may as well be watching The Years Best Commercials 2006. Its really all over the place. It doesnt develop over its running time and nothing reigns the directors in. No construct successfully joins the pieces... tedium sets in. Im at the one hour twenty minute point and Elijah Wood is in some dumb over-commercial overproduced vampire shtick. It has about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in the Antartic. Fantasy shows up I think first in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh thanks J & E for ruining another movie) and then makes way too many appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you dont need make-believe crap to make your days extraordinary. Why divide it by neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director? Has there ever been a genre more over-represented than the vampire film. Every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés.<br /><br />Making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless. The transitions get lost. This doesnt feel intentional it feels sloppy.',neg
'This is a multi-faceted insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient their (and our) perception and realities. Although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman the story delightfully flirts with physics medicine religion and even politics as it questions our perceptions about what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world Mithi is living in is as real to her as ours is to us. Within that world she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent not the gibberish that they seem to us in our world.<br /><br />Here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie (dont worry these are not spoilers). I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen wove these commentaries into the story.<br /><br />- The references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the witch-doctor (ojha in Hindi) performing his religious rituals that he believes will drive away the ghosts sitting in Mithis brain. <br /><br />- The doctor prescribing shock-treatment as a solution that is believed to work <br /><br />- Windows of perception - The scene about the review of Anus book. <br /><br />- The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for maya. <br /><br />- News footage of George Bush telling the whole world that there is no doubt in his mind that there are WMD in Iraq (now that is not as much about Bushs perception who I suspect knew the truth as the gullible publics perception about WMD in Iraq.)<br /><br />- One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi tells Anu Charu sent this man to beat me and Anu dismisses it as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenics brain when her world and the real world clash.<br /><br />Aparna Sen was bold but not bold enough to pose one big question: Is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in God? She could have inserted some scenes about normal healthy people praying to and sacrificing for a Being that no one has ever seen or heard from in all of human history (The ritual/exorcism scene doesnt go far enough). That would be the ultimate question: What is normal? Whos reality is right the Believers or the Atheists?<br /><br />IMHO this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than A Beautiful Mind. It looks at the minds of not just the sick person but also the healthy and does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our own minds and our world. If the former got 4 Oscars this deserves more - At least one each for story screenplay direction Konkona and Shabana Azmi. It was truly a treat to watch this movie and Im glad I bought the DVD for my collection. <br /><br />This was a story very well-told indeed.',pos
'This is definitely one of Jets best efforts. Few actors are able to play the stoic as Jet Li can. The action is rapid-fire and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes. As a result it may take Americans a little off-guard. A little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li film. I feel that it is an excellent introduction to Jets work and look forward to further masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) making it into the US market. A nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts.',pos
'This man is nothing short of amazing. You truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events and cry along with his family in the end. He was so passionate about his cause not just for himself but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain. I watch this video every time I am having a bad or down day and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life just like Jonny did even with his unbearable pain. My only regret is not knowing about Jonny sooner as I visited England 2 times during his life and would have been able to say Id met him. It is comforting to know Jonny is sitting on his cloud pain free! Rest in peace Dear Jonny. You deserve it!',pos
'A surprisingly effective thriller this.<br /><br />David Duchovny and Michelle Ensign Ro Forbes are a successful professional couple he a writer she a photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California and in an act of compromise Mulder agrees to the move on the condition that along the way they visit sites of historical interest concerning famous serial killers. His idea: he writes the words she takes the pictures with the end result a bestselling coffee table book that will set them up for life. To help finance the trip they decide to car share and advertise the fact. As their bad luck would have it Brad Pitt sees the advert and shortly after killing his landlord he and his girlfriend Juliette Lewis meet the writer couple and begin their cross country trek. Inevitably mischief ensues.<br /><br />Pitt is outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring Early Grayce and is capably backed up by Lewis playing her customary white trash character that seems to be her default setting. Duchovny and Forbes make for a convincing double act too and as events spiral out of control you as the viewer are sucked into their plight and can feel the tension ratcheting.<br /><br />Intelligent sinister and beautifully shot this deserves recognition beyond its current status. A top movie.',pos
'...the last time I laughed this much. Its a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without hardly ever speaking a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinsons shoulders but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber-faced social tard so great is the talent and effort put into the performance. At times exasperating at times lovable Mr Bean is an innocent unlucky chap who also happens to be evil incarnate. The brilliance of this character cannot be put into words you have to see for yourself.<br /><br />The show gets almost too depressing at times like in the infamous New Years Eve sketch or when Bean celebrates his birthday by going alone to a restaurant offering himself a congratulatory card signed by himself and being served a stake he doesnt quite fancy. Still there are times when you cant help but feel impressed by the inventive methods by which Bean gets himself out of trouble like when he disposes of said stake in numerous clever-ish ways or when he changes into swimming trunks without taking his trousers off first! Whatever your reaction to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle youre bound to throw fits of laughter while watching. <br /><br />Finally Id like to point out that although Bean is classified as a program for children it is just as enjoyable for any grown-up with a sense of humour. Because the more adult jokes will go over the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick (yes there is such a thing) is funny no matter what age you are Bean is the truest definition of a family show. This is justly a classic and it always brightens up my day.',pos
'I first heard of this one while searching the Net for reviews of another Italian giallo/horror effort the contemporaneous THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK (1974; whose R2 SE DVD from Raro Video by the way I recently acquired)  where its referenced as being in a similar vein but also just as good. Having watched FOOTSTEPS for myself now I can see where that reviewer was coming from  in that both films deal with the psychological meltdown of their female protagonist. Stylistically however this one owes far more to Art-house cinema than anything else  in particular the work of Alain Resnais and Michelangelo Antonioni (and specifically LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD [1961] and THE PASSENGER [1975] respectively); accordingly some have accused it of being deadly boring  an epithet often attached to such pretentious (read: cerebral) fare! <br /><br />Anyway the film involves the quest of a woman (Florinda Bolkan) to determine her movements in the preceding three days  of which she seems to have no recollection. Following a series of cryptic clues she travels to the mythical land of Garma (nearby locations then bear the equally fictitious names of Muda and Rheember)  where she encounters several people (including Lila Kedrova as an aristocratic regular of the resort) who ostensibly recall the heroine staying there during her blackout! Most prominent though are a young man (Peter McEnery) and a little girl (Nicoletta Elmi from Mario Bavas BARON BLOOD [1972])  the former always seems to happen on the scene at propitious moments while the latter apparently confuses Bolkan with another woman (sporting long red hair and a mean streak!).<br /><br />While essentially a mood piece this is nonetheless a gripping puzzle: inevitably vague events transpire at a deliberate pace  and where much of the films power derives from the remarkable central performance (which can be seen as an extension of Bolkans role in the fine Lucio Fulci giallo A LIZARD IN A WOMANS SKIN [1971]). However theres no denying the contribution of cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (who provides any number of sweeping camera moves and an effective color scheme  adopting orange/red/blue filters to create atmosphere and coming up with a saturated look for the disorientating bizarre finale) and Nicola Piovanis fitting melancholy score (the composer is best-known nowadays for his Oscar-winning work on Roberto Benignis Holocaust-themed tragi-comedy LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL [1997]).<br /><br />With this in mind its worth discussing how FOOTSTEPS was presented in the version I watched: well being apparently hard-to-get in its original form (I cant be sure whether its uncut here or not except to say that the film ran for 89 minutes while the IMDb  lists it at 96) this edition is culled from a fairly battered English-language VHS (the dubbing is surprisingly good given the international cast) with burnt-in Swedish subtitles to boot (besides the DivX copy froze for a few seconds at a crucial point in the story around the 82-minute mark)! Still we do get a welcome bonus i.e. a 9-minute Highlights From The Soundtrack in MP3 format.<br /><br />I realize I havent yet mentioned the moon mission subplot to which Klaus Kinskis presence is restricted: incidentally around this same time he had a similarly brief but pivotal role in another good arty thriller with sci-fi leanings (and also set in a distinctive location)  namely LIFESPAN (1974). As I lay watching the film I couldnt fathom what possible connection this had with the central plotexcept that Bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a movie she had once seen though not through to the end called Footsteps On The Moon (a somewhat misleading alternate title for the film itself)  amusingly she at first recalls the picture as being called BLOOD ON THE MOON (which of course is a classic 1948 Western noir with Robert Mitchum and directed by Robert Wise!). That said I took this diversion in stride as merely one more outlandish touch to the film (given also Bolkans former employment as a translator at a conference discussing Earths future)  and certainly didnt expect the astronauts to turn up on Garmas beach at the very end to pursue the female lead where the sand then turns ominously into the moons surface! <br /><br />The films plot will probably make more sense on a second viewing  though to be honest this is best approached as a visual/aural experience and one shouldnt really expect it to deliver a narrative thats in any way clear-cut and easily rationalized! For the record the only other Bazzoni effort Id managed to catch prior to this one was the middling straight giallo THE FIFTH CORD (1971) starring Franco Nero (which I had recorded off late-night Italian TV); some time ago I did get hold of his Spaghetti Western rendition of Carmen titled MAN PRIDE AND VENGEANCE (1968)  also with Nero and Kinski  as a DivX (after Id already missed a matinée broadcast of it)but the conversion had somehow proved faulty and consequently the disc wouldnt play properly!',pos
'This movie started off well enough sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch. The soundtrack was torturously bad. Saxaphone and electric guitars? It was gratingly incongruous. The female singer was positively dreary! In the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to Catherines eyes.<br /><br />Who in the heck is this Marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig? A totally extraneous and unnecessary character.<br /><br />One of the key elements in the book is the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherines books. His monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his childrens spirits and his treatment of Catherine based on money concerns alone. He does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send Miss Morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home. Only her friend Miss Tilneys thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded. This whole point gets seriously muddled in the film. They make the General too dark from the outset.<br /><br />Peter Firth should have not sung! This part was painful to watch. His depiction of Tilney wasnt too bad but it was a shade dark in places. Henry Tilney of the book made sport of Miss Morlands imagination on trip to Northanger but he was never dark. Firth would have benefited from better direction. The young lady who played Isabella needed a better acting coach. John Thorpe was appropriately odious. The striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly! It certainly fit his character.<br /><br />I think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack. It cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie. If I watch it again it will be with the sound OFF and subtitles on. Perhaps I would give the film a 4 then.<br /><br />The sound quality of the DVD was quite poor. The picture quality was not much better. This is glaringly noticeable on a digital television.<br /><br />When I think of what this film could have been I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.',neg
'Maybe the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up right after Conan OBrien and Late Nights fans are all of a sudden unsuspectingly watching Carsons show. Carson Daly cant hold a candle to Leno Letterman OBrien or any other late night talk show host and Last Call seems to miss more than hit in this hit and miss genre. The shows only redeeming quality is that its so short. But I wouldnt call it crap. Carson Daly is sincere and doesnt hide the fact that his show isnt great(that honesty is actually helpful here) while some of Last Calls skits and material seem to be stolen they still find the mark sometimes. Actually some of Carsons montages have been quite entertaining and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy.<br /><br />As an interviewer Carson is okay even with only one guest not exactly late night material but still above the level attained by a high school AV team. However he doesnt have the quick wit that makes Conan so hilarious. I do not like his musical guests but thats more because I am not a fan of that kind of music so Im not holding it against him.<br /><br />On to the house band. I dont know Joe Firstmans band and wouldnt compare them to the CBS Orchestra the Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or the Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and the Cleetones are better. But Firstmans band mates do still the show in my opinion. Especially the Alto Sax player that sometimes shows up (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register) if anything watch the show for him I do.<br /><br />In summary this show isnt even worth a full bag of kibble n bits. But it does have an audience and appeals more to the younger mtv generation. If you dont have cable and are up at 1:37 am there really isnt much more to choose from and surprise surprise there is worse out there in that time frame. So if youre waiting for Poker After Dark to come on 30 minutes of Last Call wont kill you during the wait.',neg
'A strong pilot this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for Enterprise the prequel to the original Star Trek series. It stumbles a few times into Trek convention and cliché--candy-colored space strippers never seem to go out of style and I can already foresee snickering references to Tpol as Seven of Vulcan--but the ensemble looks strong the characters are well-drawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than those of earlier (later?) series. Scott Bakula hits the right note as a captain with Kirks brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger and I look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator anymore!) as supporting players. The writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in Star Trek: The Next Generation Deep Space 9 and Voyager: Instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift its starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later--which I hope happens because after about a half-dozen episodes more variety will be needed.',pos
'This movie is nothing short of a dark gritty masterpiece. I may be bias as the Apartheid era is an area Ive always felt for. But Id say it ranks right up with Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country. Sadly up until a few days ago Id never even heard of this movie. Inside is one of the most underrated films of all time probably because it was a small film company Id never even heard of it before. Eric Stoltz one of my favorite actors anyway is believable and dramatic Nigel Hawthorne plays his dastardly role well. Do not look for humor in this film there is none. It is real savage and gritty to the last and to the sensitive Id say bring a box of tissues. But movies as great as this make you wonder why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of?',pos
'...but this just isnt working and I am surprised to see how many people consider it good. On what grounds? There are some loose hints here and there but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. Lynchs movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet are very playful when doing that. There is some visual sense there are some subplots characters ideas etc. But this is dull and yes pointless. Because whatever there is to explore is either to small either too far-fetched or simply told before in a superior manner. Its just Lynch exploring DV nothing more so it should be treated like this. 1/10',neg
'Fever Pitch has many of the clichés we have come to identify with Hollywood romantic comedies: a relationship between two people with little in common the secret hes been hiding that she discovers the inevitable breakup and the very public  well I wont go any further but you get the picture. In spite of its predictability it works especially if you love baseball as I do though Im not quite as obsessive as Ben Wrightman a Boston schoolteacher played by Saturday Night Live comedian Jimmy Fallon.<br /><br />Adapted from a novel by Nick Hornby by veteran screenplay writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel Ben is a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan whose Uncle gave him season tickets when he was seven years old and hes been kind of stuck emotionally at that point all of his life to the detriment of his relationships with women. Ben is not just a fan but a fanatic who travels to Fort Meyers Florida each winter for the Red Sox Spring Training games and never misses a home game during the regular season. His family does not consist of parents or siblings but the fellow groupies who attend each game with him and his bedroom is not a place to sleep but a Red Sox museum to visit.<br /><br />When he falls for business consultant Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) he is threatened with the possibility of having to grow up but Ben is not quite ready to do that. He would rather attend the Yankee series than go with her to Baltimore to meet her parents or to go to Paris with her and miss the Anaheim series. It takes his relationship being on the verge of dissolving for him to stop and think about his priorities especially when a pint-size Dr. Phil wannabe asks him You love the Red Sox but have they ever loved you back? While the premise of Fever Pitch is that some things are more important than baseball (perish the thought) you would never know it from the way things turn out. Of course to any one familiar with the history of the Boston Red Sox it is a team that will break the hearts of its most die hard fans -- but this is 2004 the year the curse of the Bambino came to an end and as the Red Sox move to a new level Ben might just do the same. Both lead performances are excellent and the Farrelly Brothers even manage a pretty gross gag. While Fever Pitch will never be mistaken for an art film it is a joyous romp that will have to go down as one of my guilty pleasures. Go Blue Jays!.',pos

I liked some of the newer characters as well (Pom Pom was adorable and I did like Prudence.). Still the storyline was somewhat limited but still very cute. So I vote 7/10.',pos
'*THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS... OR MAYBE NOT. THE WARNING IS THE SAME FOR ALL*<br /><br />Dang it. Just when I thought that SCIFI Channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies they give us THIS. Actually the plot itself its nothing we havent seen in movies like Snakes On A Plane Deep Blue Sea etc... That means a monster/animal/menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people. In this case an alien in a train. Wow.<br /><br />I must say that when I first saw this thing on cable I couldnt stop laughing. No SCIFI film had prepared me for this; it was so incredibly pathetic I couldnt believe it! The actors are all a bunch of stereotypical-genre characters. But since theyre not so famous (to say the least) I wasnt expecting much of them. Except Diamond Phillips. No comments there but I think the guy was desperate to find a job. The problem was something called special effects horrible even for SCIFI Channel standards. That model/toy they made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the model/toy helicopter bigger than a trains wagon) the meteor coming HORIZONTALLY from space the baby alien (a sock puppet and I aint kiddin) the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly... while they were static; when they started moving it was awful the explosions (the terrorist blew up LITERALLY! And what about the exploding helicopter! Just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying?) the insane mathematics used (they couldnt even solve a school problem right!)... And I wont talk about that doomsday-like ending by that time I didnt know if to keep laughing or to start crying. If I remember right I did both.<br /><br />Its an ideal movie to have a good laugh alone or with friends. But be warned; its so ridiculous at SO MANY levels... and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief...',neg
'Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. I think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the Matrix style of films. Europa is a breath of fresh air a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. The back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they are having. Other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like Hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions.<br /><br />I could talk about the effects more but I think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own and really heighten the drama of the film. A film to buy if you dont own already and one to see if you have not.<br /><br />10/10 Dont miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors.',pos
'Dan the widowed father of three girls has his own advice column that will probably go into syndication. After his wifes death he has taken time to raise his daughters. Having known no romance in quite some time nothing prepares him for the encounter with the radiant Marie at a local book store in a Rhode Island small town on the ocean where he has gone to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. After liking Marie at first sight little prepares him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound. After all she is the date of Dans brother Mitch.<br /><br />It is clear from the outset that Dan and Marie are made for one another and although we sense what the outcome will be we go for the fun ride that Peter Hedges the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges an author and screenplay writer on his own has given us two excellent novels Whats Eating Gilber Grapes and An Ocean in Iowa and the delightful indie Pieces of April which he also directed. Its just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during Thanksgiving reunions.<br /><br />The best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. Mr. Carell in fact keeps getting better all the time. In many ways he remind us of Jack Lemmon in his take of comedy and serious material. What can one say about Ms. Binoche an intelligent actress and a bright presence in any film. She proves she is right up to doing comedy convincing us about her Marie.<br /><br />The only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture. John Mahoney Diane Wiest Norbert Leo Butz Jessica Hecht Emily Blunt Allison Pill Amy Ryan have nothing to do. They just serve as incidental music for decoration. Dane Cook who is seen as brother Mitch fares better because he gets to recite more lines than the others.<br /><br />Dan in Real Life is a delightful film that will please everyone.',pos
'My thoughts on the movie 9<br /><br />It was not good not good at all. Visually it was great. I was pleased with the pacing the camera angles etc. However the characters? eh kinda bland. Plot? It sucked.<br /><br />This movie seemed more new age crap than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science isnt portrayed any better. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything... but souls have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really?<br /><br />Thats something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie... created with science... and theyre using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask<br /><br />Okay so now what? (or something similar). I couldnt hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit. It was a okay... it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now lets get out of here as fast as possible! type of exit.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where you cant think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily. Any thought as to whats the point of that? will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing.<br /><br />Okay... SPOILERS follow.<br /><br />So basically a scientist creates the Machine that is capable of creating other intelligent robotic life. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However the scientist realizes that he is also at fault. He gave the Machine his intellect but didnt give it his heart. <br /><br />The Machine goes Skynet on humanitys collective ass and wipes out all life on earth finally slowly powering down. However the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock-puppets. Each one containing a piece of the scientists soul.<br /><br />The last one #9 wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets up with another like himself #2. <br /><br />Well #2 gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. #9 finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue #2. <br /><br />They succeed.<br /><br />#9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life... pulling out #2s soul in the process.<br /><br />The movie then continues with action scenes with #9 trying to rescue his soul-yanked compatriots. <br /><br />They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends who go up into the clouds. It then rains and we see life returning back to the planet.<br /><br />Hunh?!?<br /><br />That makes no sense. None at all. Why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 homunculi? What did it accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!?<br /><br />Why did he expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine but with a soul to fight the first.. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success.<br /><br />Why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps?',neg
'After reading the book Heart of Darkness the movie did not do it justice. The movie puts the book to shame and anyone who has not experienced the book would frown upon the story and plot because it was portrayed so poorly by the movie. In the film the characters and set were just some of the let downs that occurred in the movie. The director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made.<br /><br />Of course any book is better than the movie but these werent even comparable. Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and the cleverness of the written word. The movie doesnt even start to show any of this. Some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out like how Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Also when Marlow went to deliver the news to Kurtzs intended she reacted differently in the movie rather than the book. Another major difference was that Marlow saw the picture of the lady that was blindfolded at the end of the movie not at the beginning like the book. This was influential on how the audience perceived Marlow and the movie totally messed that up.<br /><br />The book was so fine tuned on what every location looked like but the scenery in the movie was a let down. There was a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment a bunch of bad actors to go along with it. There was one exception to the awful actors and that would be Isaach De Bankolé who played Mfumu. His character was depicted the best. Though the movie wasnt that great I still would recommend it ONLY if you have read and understood the book very well. That way you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them. If you have not read the book I do not recommend the movie because it is a boring lifeless mess. I loved the book so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.',neg
'I have no idea who these others are but this movie is plain awful. They have to prop up Joe Pesci when he is a minor character. Bait and switch movie just like the studios did with Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey etc. The DVD I watched states this obscure gem revolves around JOe Pescis MOB character who is a hothead that start a war etc. etc. Joe plays the part of Joe he does not even carry a gun plays a whimpy character and gets SPOILER - (whacked). So much for the movie revolving around Pesci. The only halfway memorable scene was a bad attempt at comedy when they passed gas while waiting for a score. If you watch this movie after reading this I warned you. Please stop and do not lose 87 minutes of your life.',neg
'Deepa has again tried to bravely bring out a subject that no one wants to talk about. The story line is OK cinematography is outstanding screenplay and acting are way below average. I guess the blame is to the citizens of Uttar Pradesh in India from where her original set was destroyed in 2000. This resulted in a totally different cast I just wonder what a spectacular movie it would have been if it had the original Shabana Azmi Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. The current actors Lisa Ray (whos just good for squirming in Bombay Dyeing bedsheets) and John Abraham are pathetic need basic lessons in acting. Seema Biswas Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda have saved the movie as much as they can. The kid had done an outstanding job. The editing and the flow of the movie is also not something you would have expected from Deepa. Great subject sends out a strong message about a practice which is still pretty rampant in rural India but falls short of the standards Deepa set for herself in Fire and Earth. Watch it once...when its on DVD dont bother paying $10 to see it....well its out beats the average Hindi movie any day',neg
'Theres nothing wrong with softcore but this one is pretty clinical - lots of nudity but its all fake (of course its always fake - its a movie but you know what I mean). Theres no sexuality or erotica its all random nudity and poor acting of lust and sex with each other.<br /><br />Part of it is of course your personal preference. These women clearly have some body issues with their piercings tattoos and silicon - not to mention that overly plastique & leathery look so if thats your thing - great you get to see all that here.<br /><br />I dont think anyones expectations are very high when looking at a movie title such as this but for many people it would be pretty much like looking at cyborg fembots ... they almost seem real but its really more creepy.',neg
'From the first to the last scene this film is made very realisticallyeven too realistically that sometimes we cant see details in night scenes(its dark as real night)in the desert(sunshine is so strong as in real desert). <br /><br />Script and actors play are also very realistic. Shots and episodes are edited not to show things and events effectively to explain them oras many Hollywood films do to entertain viewers. Editing here is to represent the events as if they really happened in Afganistan. Camera is set sometimes far from dying solders even the moment when the main character Major Bandura is shot and killed.<br /><br />Such method reminds me of masterpieces of Italian neo-realism. And the construction of the story here is based on the same principles as Paisàor The Bicycle Thief--chronological series of true to life episodes and a few pathetic moments which at first seem to be sudden and illogical but have inner reasons.<br /><br />I think the inner reason of Major Banduras suicidal death is religious emotion--Repentance for innocent peoples death(not only his accidental killing of family in the village but also death of solders under his command).He is not depicted as a eager believeron the contrary he is depicted as tactful and responsible officer.Exactly for this reason his last decisions(to go back to the destroyed village and to turn his back to an armed boy whose family he killed)seem an act of Repentance. <br /><br />The Russian Orthodox choral which sounds at the end(Evening Sacrifice)is another contextby which all the film can be seen from this point of view.',pos

'A Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE film.<br /><br />Keeping the blood pumping through our veins is the responsibility of hardworking HEMO THE Magnificent.<br /><br />In the mid-1950s AT&T and Bell Science teamed with famed Hollywood director Frank Capra to produce a series of CBS television science films to educate the public about the Universe around them. A far cry from the dreary black & white fodder so often foisted off on young scholars the Capra films would both instruct and entertain with lively scripts and eye-catching visuals shown in Technicolor. The four films - OUR MR. SUN (1956) THE STRANGE CASE OF THE COSMIC RAYS (1957) HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957) THE UNCHAINED GODDESS (1958) - quickly became schoolhouse favorites where they were endlessly shown in 16mm format.<br /><br />The star of the series was Dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982) an affable English professor at the University of Southern California. This avuncular pedagogue proved to be the perfect film instructor genially imparting to his audience the sometimes complex facts in a manner which never made them seem dull or boring. Dr. Baxter who won a Peabody Award for his achievements continued making high quality instructional films after the Capra quartet were concluded.<br /><br />HEMO THE Magnificent which was produced written & directed by Capra relates the story of the human heart and blood circulation system using animation and gentle humor. Film star Richard Carlson appears as the Fiction Writer energetically helping Dr. Baxter tell Hemos tale.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the TV production crew and the voices of Marvin Miller Mel Blanc June Foray & Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters all uncredited.<br /><br />The devotional Scripture which begins the film is completely in tune with the tenor & tone of the production.',pos
'Let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original Lonesome Dove than I. Both the Pulitzer Prize-winning book and the towering mini-series adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving dramatic believable and engrossing works. There is no comparison between Lonesome Dove and any Western film- at least not since the legendary collaborations of John Ford and John Wayne. It was with real reservations that I sat down to watch this new mini-series what with McMurtrys non-participation and the missing original cast members. After watching the first episode it was clear that this is no Lonesome Dove. In almost every measurable way this sequel falls short of the original. But so what? I wasnt expecting it to measure up. Taken as an effort of its own this film is engaging entertaining and of a very good quality. If it were done as a new story not as a sequel to Lonesome Dove there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings. Jon Voight did a creditable job as Call Barbara Hershey was a terrific Clara and the new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well rendered and believable. Louis Gossett jr. deserves special mention as the horse wrangler Isom Pickett. The film made me care about the characters and I dont ask any more than that from an actor. it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of its predecessor- it is worth viewing in its own right.',pos

'Once upon a time in a castle...... Two little girls are playing in the gardens castle. They are sisters. A blonde little girl (Kitty) and a brunette one (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kittys doll. Kitty pursues Evelyn. Running through long corridors they reach the room where their grandfather sitting on an armchair reads the newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn while Evelyn is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn begins to say repeatedly: I am the red lady and Kitty is the black lady. Suddenly Evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs Kittys doll and then cuts her (the dolls) head. A fight ensues. And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty. The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided.<br /><br />Later on their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in red:<br /><br />A long time ago a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle. They were sisters and hated each other. One night for jealousy reasons the black lady entered the red ladys room and stabbed her seven times. One year later the red lady left her grave. She killed six innocent people and her seventh victim was the black lady. Once every hundred years the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself.<br /><br />The grandfather ends his tale by saying that according to the legend sixteen years from now the red queen should come again and kill seven times. But he assures them that this is just an old legend.<br /><br />Sixteen years pass.....<br /><br />This is the very beginning of the film. There are many twists and surprises in the film.

'Actually this flick made in 1999 has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There arent a bunch of clowns running around blasting away expending hundreds of rounds but never hitting flesh. Nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.<br /><br />The interiors look respectably modern architecturally and the equipment looks up to snuff. Well there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a 50s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the corpses cracked me up. Not pancake make-up in the conventional sense but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer).<br /><br />Ah yes the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci-fi horror flick I know of but I cant. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Gimme a break. Warp drives a la Star Trek are one thing but photons becoming viruses? This is so silly the desired fright factor just isnt realizable. The flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive or have a cat jump out of the closet or something because the viral thingamajig isnt doing it. <br /><br />One presumes Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later trashy venues.

This is no holds barred fun for everyone. I dont understand the John Garfield issue though. Does it matter whether or not hes in this film? If he is he screen is so short that hes basically a prop.

'Sadly Marry Harron decided to do a fictional account of Bettie Pages life to go along with her own issues with men. As typical in all her work every major male character is portrayed as weak bumbling or twisted. To add to her fiction she projects ideas and issues that are not true according to Bettie Page herself. Bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues (though she became a born-again later in life through the influence of her 3rd husband- a minister). She left it because she was in her late 30s her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks. The hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in Betties own words and are the directors attempts to claim that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been victimized by men. Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots (not handed to her by sick fetishists). Harron also fails to make a point that Bunny Yeager who did many famous photo shoots of Bettie also did many naughty shoots with Bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film.<br /><br />The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks very much like Bettie. Otherwise there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it.',neg
'Im really tempted to reward The Case of the Scorpions Tail with a solid 10 out of 10 rating but that would largely be because I think Italian horror cinema of the 1970s is SO much better than the cheesy crap I usually watch. But even without an extra point for nostalgia this is STILL a genuine masterwork and earning a high rating for its excellently convoluted story uncanny atmosphere blood-soaked killing sequences and superb casting choices. In my humble opinion this is actually Sergio Martinos finest giallo and that has got to mean something as The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh All the Colors of the Dark Torso and Your Vice is a Locked Room and only I have the Key are all top-notch genre achievements as well. But this film is just a tad bit superior with its ultra-compelling plot revolving on an insurance fraud gone madly out of control. Following her husbands peculiar death in a plane explosion (!) Lisa Baumer promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and shes eager to leave the country as soon as possible. Due to the bizarre circumstances the insurance company puts their best investigator Peter Lynch on the case and he follows her to Greece. There Lisa becomes the target of many assaults and the cases mysteriousness increases when it turns out several people are hunting for the money. Im always overly anxious when briefly summarizing gialli because I dont want to risk giving away essential plot elements. In The Case of the Scorpions Tail the events take an abrupt and totally unexpected turn before the story is even halfway and I certainly dont want to ruin this for you. Many red herrings follow after that but Sergio Martino always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and even though not a 100\% satisfying the denouement is at least surprising. Its also a very stylish film with imaginative camera-work and excellent music by Bruno Nicolai. Everyone s favorite giallo muse Edwige Fenech oddly didnt make it to this cast (she stars in no less than 3 other supreme Martino gialli) but Anita Strindberg (Lizard in a Womans Skin Who Saw Her Die?) is a more than worthy replacement for her. The charismatic and hunky George Hilton is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and  duh  ladies man deluxe. If youre a fan of giallo dont wait as long as I did to WATCH THIS FILM!!!!',pos
'Watching John Cassavetes film Opening Night I was reminded of something that Quentin Tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting. He referred to an example of say if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it wouldnt be the end of his life but that it would affect him and that without a doubt he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy. Otherwise as he said what am I doing? I couldnt help but think of his words when watching Gena Rowlands character Myrtle Gordon who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario. There is more to this in Cassavetes film of course since its about how the theater works around a star actress what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character and how one lives when all one has (like Myrtle Gordon) is the theater.<br /><br />Near the beginning of the film after exiting a performance Myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named Nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to Myrtle. Its a touching little moment but it doesnt last as she has to get in the car (pouring rain and all). She then watches in horror as the girl who stood right next to the car as it drove off gets hit by another car in an auto accident. Shes not sure really what happened but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit. From then on shes sort of stunned by this even after she thinks its out of her system. At first this shows in small ways like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor (played by Cassavetes) and cant seem to stand being hit - she blames it on the lack of depth in the character (the writer: What do you think the play lacks? Hope says Myrtle)- but then Nancy starts to show up to her an apparition that to Myrtle is all to real until shes suddenly gone.<br /><br />Cassavetes as in the past films is after a search for what it means to have emotion to really feel about something and feel it or the lack thereof and how it affects others around the person. This isnt exactly new ground for Rowlands who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in Woman Under the Influence (in that case because of alcohol) nor would it be alien territory for costar Ben Gazzara who just came off starring in Killing of a Chinese Bookie. But the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene; Cassavetes doesnt tell them how to get from A to B in a scene and he doesnt need to. Theres a mood in a Cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camera-work. You know Myrtle for example should be content somehow even if it isnt with the plot. But shes haunted and is unsatisfied with her characters lack of depth and the tone of the play (Aging who goes to see that? she asks the playwright) and it starts to affect those around her too.<br /><br />The question soon becomes though not what is the usual. A conventional dramatist would make the conflict Will she be able to go on stage will the show go on? This isnt important for Cassavetes even if its there as is the question Will she be alright? Perhaps going through such a grueling play as The Second Woman could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality (seeing Sara and attacking her in front of total strangers who wonder what the hell is going on)? Or will the plays lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her? The depths Rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing and that its expected doesnt mean its any duller than Woman Under the Influence- if anything its just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession and consequently the other performances are just as true from Gazarra to Nancy played by a subtle Laura Johnson. Cassavetes answers to his own posed questions arent easy.<br /><br />One of the real thrills of Opening Night along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script is to see Cassavetes take on the theater the way he does. We see the play performed- and its apparently a real play- and we only know slightly what its about. When we see the actors on the stage performing it we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on (relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence) and the improvisation of the actors. I wondered watching how much really was improvised how much Cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where Myrtle starts to go loopy or in the climax is completely smashed. Hes on the stage too so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen.<br /><br />Its funny startling chilling and edge-of-your-seat stuff some of the best theater-on-film scenes ever put in a movie and we see the lines between actor on stage actor on film actor with actor blur together wonderfully. Opening Night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness reality and fiction where the love is between people and really finally what does acting mean?',pos

'Personally Ive watched it because of Lea Thompsons appearance and I didnt really expect to enjoy the movie as such but surprisingly I kept watching it until the end.<br /><br />Lets face it - it just one of the saga-like stories and isnt particularly original or entertaining but strangely it just keeps you by the TV. My opinion about Will of Their Own would be much better if there wouldnt be one point that I just dont get.<br /><br />There is lovely and really touchy scene in which Lea Thompsons character is running on the street holding baby in her arms the snow is falling she is cold scared and has no place to stay she doesnt know what to do next. And then about 10-12 years later when things are better for her she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming about.<br /><br />I just dont get it - I dont see how is it possible that she would do such thing it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival. After this character flip I just couldnt enjoy rest of the movie.',neg
'A blackly comic tale of a down-trodden priest Nazarin showcases the economy that Luis Bunuel was able to achieve in being able to tell a deeply humanist fable with a minimum of fuss. As an output from his Mexican era of film making it was an invaluable talent to possess with little money and extremely tight schedules. Nazarin however surpasses many of Bunuels previous Mexican films in terms of the acting (Francisco Rabal is excellent) narrative and theme.<br /><br />The theme interestingly is something that was explored again in Viridiana made three years later in Spain. It concerns the individuals struggle for humanity and altruism amongst a society that rejects any notion of virtue. Father Nazarin however is portrayed more sympathetically than Sister Viridiana. Whereas the latter seems to choose charity because she wishes to atone for her (perceived) sins Nazarins whole existence and reason for being seems to be to help others whether they (or we) like it or not. The films last scenes in which he casts doubt on his behaviour and in a split second has to choose between the life he has been leading or the conventional life that is expected of a priest are so emotional because they concern his moral integrity and we are never quite sure whether it remains intact or not.<br /><br />This is a remarkable film and I would urge anyone interested in classic cinema to seek it out. It is one of Bunuels most moving films and encapsulates many of his obsessions: frustrated desire mad love religious hypocrisy etc. In my view Nazarin is second only to The Exterminating Angel in terms of his Mexican movies and is certainly near the top of the list of Bunuels total filmic output.',pos
'A very different Jerry Lewis film not like all those more famous films that everybody knows. Lewis deals with the difficult task of WW II and National Socialism in Germany in a rather unconventional way. But even more interesting and important he does it in a very un-American way. And as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry un-American means more sophisticated more subtle more intelligent or simply better. That is the reason why the film was no success in the US but a very great success in Europe.<br /><br />All in all Jerry Lewis has proven by this movie that he is able to do much more than simple slapstick comedy.',pos

Second thing that bugged me why were we shown Vinny Jones boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid then these have no further role. Why not?

Like many other reviewers i came across what can only be described as a piece of poopy in a gold wrapper. The front cover is great and the comment on the back is mesmerising - it will scare the crop out of you...oh how i chuckle looking back at such naivety and ignorance.<br /><br />One of the many things scarier than this movie is the acting skills of these actors. I think no i did actually cheer when they got slashed up by these scarecrows who were wearing some classic fancy dress costumes. I used to drive quite quickly past cornfields as i found them to be pretty scary at night but having seen this movie i nearly wet myself (through laughing so much) just at the sight. <br /><br />I have seen scarier omelettes quite honestly not mine though im a dab-hand at cooking omelettes and if anyone associates this movie with my omelettes lets just say that i would create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row.<br /><br />If anyone has any good corn (crop not pop) movies they can recommend feel free to inform me. Its a great comedy if nothing else OK it is nothing else. Enjoy but a little advice - before pressing the play button on your DVD player throw it out of the window.',neg
'Im a fan of arty movies but regretfully I have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel. Agonisingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise the experience is shall we say trying. Even after bad movies I feel that I learn something or enjoyed some aspect but there there was nothing to appreciate. The premise was not uninteresting but the movie starts and ends there. The acting was OK though the characters were utterly boring. For the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal she is mightily empty. Pity. I usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.',neg
'Its too bad these guys the so-called judges are such jerks even the nominally sensitive ones. Its the self-congratulatory tone that really makes me sick though; these guys dont have any perspective on their behaviour. I think the real problem though is the quality of the contestants. Not a single smooth or truly charming one in the lot. They pick the most pathetic girls out of the crowd because theyre the only ones these guys have a chance with. Lets see some real players trying for a truly unattainable girl and maybe you have a show. Otherwise you have a revolting half-hour of self-love. And real sexual tension takes two.',neg
'A CBS radio program entitled We the People assists in finding an American home for Vienna refugee Charles Coburn (as Karl Braun) a skilled surgeon and pool hustler. He arrives with beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (as Leni) who is studying to become a nurse. Relocated to a small dusty Midwestern village they are welcomed at the station by burly John Wayne (as John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (as Nunk Atterbury) a veterinarian. Ms. Gurie is unhappy in the dustbowl and wants to leave. Immediately. But the prospect of romance with Mr. Wayne might change her mind...<br /><br />God answers the citizens many prayers for rain but it may not be enough to save the farming town. The entire town is advised to relocate to Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and tough it out. Coburn receives an invitation to work at a top clinic. And Gurie learns her fiancé presumed dead will be arriving to claim her as his wife. She feels duty-bound to accept; but he has a dark secret... This film does not flatter Wayne who seems way out of his element. Being paired with Gurie promoted as another Garbo doesnt help. They do have a cute scene in Waynes car (Jalopy an Italian car).<br /><br />**** Three Faces West (7/3/40) Bernard Vorhaus ~ John Wayne Sigrid Gurie Charles Coburn Spencer Charters',neg
'This may very well be the worst movie Ill see if I live to be 100. I think a group of first-graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this. Im dumber for having watched it and God have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film.<br /><br />And after I finally turned it off I actually had the urge to vomit.<br /><br />No one had a clue about photography when made this. No one had a clue about acting. No one had a clue about just about anything.<br /><br />I cant believe F/X shows this crap on occasion. The only time I had seen it was on one of the Starz! channels - not even the main one. And it was on at about 3 a.m. at that.',neg
'Wow... just... wow. There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add some comments of my own. I agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and directing - whoo boy does it ever. However I think there is some other problems here.<br /><br />1. Why is Christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? The film acts as though you just cant be a Christian and also allow for the possibility? Why? They ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film (i.e. The Bible doesnt say there is aliens. Well the Bible doesnt say there isnt.) but the actual rebuttal is never answered. The Bible really doesnt say there isnt. So how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand? Or better yet acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite God there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them.<br /><br />2. How come the ONLY two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax? What about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences? What if its something else entirely? Too bad the film makers already have their minds made up.<br /><br />3. The film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult. Thats a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present. Im not necessarily arguing that they dont but if youre going to say something so asinine youd better have the facts to back it up.<br /><br />4. Why does the other reporter (not the Greasy Haired Blonde Guy the other one) always have his hands in his pockets? Its hard to take someone seriously when theyre constantly playing pocket pool.<br /><br />I WISH this had been an exploration of Christian faith and UFO phenomena but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their Faith Message to care much about make a thought provoking movie. As a Christian myself this saddens me.',neg
'How this film gains a 6.7 rating is beyond belief. It deserves nothing better than a 2.0 and clearly should rank among IMDbs worst 100 films of all time. National Treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on American audiences by Hollywood. Critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler through.<br /><br />I love the justifications for this movie being good... Nicholas Cage is cute. Come on people no wonder people around the world think Americans are stupid. This has to be the most stupid insulting movie I have ever seen. If you wanted to see an actually decent film this season consider Kinsey The Woodsman Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. National Treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films. I bet most of you reading this havent even heard of them since some havent been widely released yet.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor - when he is in the right movies. Time after time Ive seen Cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind-numbing films like Con Air The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is put to good use like in Charlie Kaufmans Adaptation he is an incredible actor.<br /><br />Bottom line - Id rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again.',neg
'Dont mistake War Inc. for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs. It isnt.<br /><br />This is an old-fashioned screwball comedy with ridiculously coincidental plot twists stock characters (given some depth in fun performances by John Cusack Joan Cusack Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a straightforward approach to the political content.<br /><br />You see the filmmakers political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true. Yeah we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt inept pigs the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons and American imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now -- but none of that is the point.<br /><br />Here all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon -- sometimes in genius ways -- as the backdrop for a silly romp as John Cusacks character (the hit-man with a heart) tries to change his life with the help of the do-gooder journalist who doesnt trust him (Tomei) and the young Middle Eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage (Duff). Cusacks sister Joan plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality. Ben Kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless CIA boss.<br /><br />Thats all and it works. Its simple fun but if somehow you cant see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and theres no corruption and people in the Middle East wish our Western culture would supplant theirs then you might not find it as funny.<br /><br />For all the rest of us it was a light comedy with a political edge.',pos
'It was praised to be a fast paced screwball comedy and the best German movie of the year so I gave it a try even though Ive already seen some films by Dani Levy - or at least parts of them.<br /><br />I got what I had expected: no comedy at all unless you think that heart attacks are funny. Its a fine example of sloppy screen writing with an implausible plot and characters loaded with clichés that might be true but surely are not funny either.<br /><br />The most annoying character is that of Zuckers wife played by Hannelore Elsner. She has to behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving. For example: She doesnt know a single thing about Judaism but by reasons most likely unknown to even herself she gets the idea to play the charade that she and her family are Jewish laws obeying Jews for her husbands family who really are and of the very orthodox and self-righteous variety. To make it a bit more complicated she invites the four of them to stay at her city flat because they arrive from Frankfurt in Berlin without having booked their hotels in advance something no 60 years old business man actually no grown-up German would ever do. This gives the viewer a lot to swallow but still fails to produce any jokes.<br /><br />Zucker and his brother Samuel havent seen each other for forty years but it turns out that his daughter - now a lesbian - and Samuels son - now a militant orthodox - were once lovers and hes HER daughters father. Samuels daughter - a nympho - goes after Zuckers gay son. Is this supposed to be a somehow humorous parody of Jewish incestuous tendencies? Probably its just a thoughtless way to add some love action turbulence every screwball comedy needs. And of course is also fails to produce any jokes.<br /><br />The praise for this movie is purely political. Therefore only people who enjoy watching movies that are supposed to be politically important will enjoy this one - even though Alles auf Zucker! quite clearly has no importance of any kind.<br /><br />For all the rest: Dont watch it without a Fast forward-option. I really missed it.',neg
'Quite possibly the nicest woman in show business and the sexiest Debbie gives another fine performance here. Although her work in American Nightmare was far superior she is still worth watching in this film.<br /><br />The cast is filled with your typical Melrose Place types chiseled features and seductive curves that I had never seen before. Other than Debbie Laura Nativo was the only actress I had seen before in the similar Delta Delta Die.<br /><br />The plot centers around a group of California arrogants who initiate poor naive Debbie Rochon into their clique. They tell her that they have a murder club and that she must kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people so she quickly kills a person and now the group must decide what to do with her after she fell for their joke.<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Plentiful! Debbie Rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face. Gore hounds will surely enjoy!)<br /><br />NUDITY: $$$$$ (Plentiful as well! Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes as do many of the no-name actresses and actors. The pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked; man and woman alike. Julie Strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes).<br /><br />STORY: $$ (Could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes. I understand that B-Rate films use nudity often but this is borderline excessive).<br /><br />ACTING: $ (The acting is sub standard to say the least. Rochon is always a treat easily the best B-Rate actress in the business today but her character in American Nightmare was superior. Danny Wolske does a fine job as Debbies object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about).',neg
'(Contains spoilers)<br /><br />People who put a Lonely Hearts ad in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to put into a few words everything they are and expect. The exchange of letters is full of hope...Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo) owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar) is so affected by the letters of Julie Roussell that he proposes to her. But not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the Mississippi but - Catherine Deneuve. And we know from the start that she is a marriage imposter and that a crime has taken place. She shows no interest in Julies wardrobe (she does not even get her trunk open) and neglects her canary until it dies. But the most basic tricks of seduction (an open zipper) are sufficient to transform Louis into a pliable little dog. First: a joint bank account. And then when Julies sister draws attention to herself the flight. With 27850 millions of Louis 28 millions - she would have needed his signature for the entire sum.<br /><br />Louis and Julies sister engage a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis contrives to trace Marion (Deneuves real name) in Antibes where she works as taxi-girl - her gangster-lover left her penniless or rather centimeless. Louis finds himself unable to kill her. She tells her story: Orphan. Precocious. Lesbian experiences. Many sugardaddies. Jail - and soon she leads him by the nose again. The detective turns out to be sly as a fox and tenacious as a blood hound; Louis and Marion bury his body in the cellar. They flee to Paris where Louis discovers that Marion has a costly taste. She worships money like a deity. He sells his firm at a fraction of its value. But when the corpse of the detective is discovered (a flood) they have to flee again - without the money. Life in a mountain lodge together with a whining loser - Marion can think of a more cheerful life without this appendage...<br /><br />A high point in the careers of everybody involved. Belmondos self-deceit makes him nearly endearing. Deneuve looks beautiful in her wardrobe by Yves St. Laurent and her performance is delightful: At first she fakes the fragile wifey - too timid to ask her husband for money thats why the joint bank account is needed - but after being exposed she sounds like Katharine Hepburn in the jail scene of BRINGING UP BABY. The scenery is spectacular - the tropics the riviera Paris. Truffaut directs with self-evident aplomb: the sixties were the only decade when european films were head and shoulders above american productions. After this film Truffaut was able to look his idol Alfred Hichcock full in the face.',pos
'For all the Homicide junkies out there this movie was great! Every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie. It helped to resolve some (but not all) issues from the series. Unfortunately unless you actually did watch the series most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie made heavy references to every season of the shows existence. This probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie but we gotta take what we can get. I hope they make more movies and continue to feature Homicide characters on Law and Order.',pos
'Steven Spielberg (at 24) had already directed two superb episodes of a 1971 series called The Psychiatrist starring Roy Thinnes. One episode had been about an emotionally troubled 12-year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man (Clu Gulager in his best performance) who is dying of cancer. Both episodes were stunning visually unlike anything else on TV and emotionally complex and adult. The creators of The Psychiatrist were Richard Levinson and William Link who created Columbo and also produced its first season.<br /><br />Peter Falk insisted on first rank experienced TV directors for the first season of Columbo like Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk agreed to Spielberg after watching part of the Clu Gulagher episode of The Psychiatrist.<br /><br />Spielberg says on the DVD of Duel that he loved Steven Bochcos Murder by the Book script (based on a Levinson/Link story) and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature even thought he had a lot less money to work with.<br /><br />This episode of Columbo is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other Columbo episode even though the series always used top directors. Spielberg manages to keep the great Falk and Cassidy from hamming it up too much but both actors are still a lot of fun. Spielberg also gets fine supporting work from Martin Milner Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All the performances have a freshness and vitality about them. The only Columbo episode that was close to being as well directed is the By Dawns Early Light episode with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart).<br /><br />I think the two episodes of The Psychiatrist and this episode of Columbo suggest Spielberg hasnt developed technically all that much as a director. He was great from the beginning. In a Combat! DVD commentary of a 1962 episode guest starring Albert Salmi Robert Altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director. Maybe the same is true of Spielberg.',pos
'When I saw this movie I couldnt believe my eyes. Where these hilarious creatures dustbin muppets with big pointy teeth really meant to be scary? Or where they designed to have a good laugh (I sincerely hope so). If you watch carefully you can even see the strings operating them (better; dragging them across the screen). The whole was rather funny than scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was amazed by its overall incapacity to have only one good part. It is one big joke from beginning to end and I believe this movie belongs into a new category: So unbelievable crappy youll be laughing from beginning to end.

'Im not really sure what to make of this movie especially after seeing a great film like La Notte. Unfortunately I saw this in German during an Antonioni film festival at the Frankfurt Film Museum so I didnt get to hear Malkovichs great voice. He is supposed to tie together four stories about couples in Italy. However as good an actor as he is Malkovich cannot rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here: a woman who comes up to him at a waterside cafe near a shop she owns and blurts out about how she killed her father nearby. Then the two of them go home have sex and he leaves. It seems as if Antonioni lost the subtlety had in earlier films (like The Passenger) when dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity.<br /><br />However nonsensical the storyline is the film features two things that make it watchable: eye and ear candy. The actors and actresses are all beautiful people and the cinematography is marvelous - scenes in old Italian cities contrasting with a bit in a tall apartment building overlooking a city (reminiscent of La Notte).<br /><br />The ear candy however is what really makes the film worth watching. U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on Your Blue Room and Beach Sequence both of which set the mood perfectly in the film. The songs are available on Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1.',pos

'This is a very funny Ealing comedy about a community in central London who through an unusual set of circumstances discover they are not English but are an annex of the French province of Burgundy.<br /><br />The film features comic actor Stanley Holloway (best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY) as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period.<br /><br />The story was apparently based on a news item at the time when the Canadian Government officially gave a hotel room to a visiting European member of royalty. The idea actually reminded me of the real-life case of the Hutt River Province in Western Australia where a landowner seceded from the Australian Government due to a wool quota dispute. (It was never acknowledged by the Western Australian or Australian Governments).<br /><br />This is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues rather like the TV show Yes Minister; as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well.',pos
'The 60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. It is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white and color. If done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly  it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. The acting wasnt extremely bad for a made for TV flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960s? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized everything had to turn out right in the end. I would advise you to not waste your time on The 60s and do something else with your time. Im glad I watched this in class and not on my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylans music. Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice and stay away from this.',neg

'LOC could have been a very well made movie on how the Kargil war was fought; it had the locations the budget and the skill to have been Indias Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down. Instead it come across as a bloated 4 hour bore of trying to meld the war move with the masala movie. Even the war scenes were terribly executed using the same hill in all their battle scenes and spending unnecessary time on casual talk. Instead of trying to appeal to the indian public a better movie would have been a to-the-book account of what happened at Kargil (like Black Hawk Down) or even spending time on the militant point of view (like Tora Tora Tora). Even better it could have used a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write direct and edit the film. Until then Id like to see some one re-edit this film with only the pertinent portions included; it would make the movie more watchable.',neg

'Easily 9 out of 10 for a film by director we will continue to grow to admire. But dont watch this movie expecting to be entertained. Ang Lee takes an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of the Civil War. What is beautiful about the movie like all of Lees films is that he doesnt side with his characters. He creates characters embodies them with life problems and ambiguity ... and endows them with a reality that often hits far closer to home than with which many are comfortable. This film has action but it is not for the action lover since the violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous ... i.e. like the characters it is real. And as you would expect about one of mankinds most horrific wars the violence is horrific.<br /><br />But as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely dwelt within the Civil War it is a masterpiece. Was the war about slavery and an abolitionism? Lee seems quite willing to blur that line made so popular in depictions like the Blue and the Grey. Neither is about idealism though as seen in Gone with the Wind. It is about freedom about the desire to have something which is yours and to fight for it. As you watch the characters you will ask yourself how can they be fighting to preserve slavery? The fact is I dont think they really are and in that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the maelstrom of the Civil War.<br /><br />The fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting out of senses of loyalty to home though they may never have examined what home represents or whether they truly espouse its values. The letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limits. And when the tension finally snaps and these characters find themselves suddenly free ... we see the birth of new men.<br /><br />All this mixed in with Lees beautiful incorporation of humankinds environment with breathtaking vistas and frames. Lee has a style which is his somehow European in its art (a slow camera unrushed) Asian in its epic-ness and development of story and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many in North Americans.<br /><br />Relax let go of your preconceptions about what the Civil War is what the western as a genre is what a war movie should be ... and let Ang Lee take you into a world so fragile so hard so real that few of us can comfortably see it.<br /><br />In this Lee continues what he wrought in Ice Storm. Again the movie is slow paced and without apparent direction ... a sure sign of Lees ability to direct without imposing himself on the story or screen. His direction is amplified by what he brings out of Jewel (yes the singer) a hitherto unproven actress who puts in an amazing performance.<br /><br />A movie for those who love film and are not lovers of the standard Hollywood epic.',pos
'A Thief in the Night has got to be the best out of all the end times thrillers. I have no clue what people are complaining about what people are whining about when they say that these movies scared them into accepting God. They just needed to find an excuse and blamed A Thief In The Night. Do not listen! These movies do not only tell of one of the many possibilities of the tribulation but theyre also fun to watch in their simplicity. They are in fact low-budget and that is a little obvious but not all too obvious upon first viewing. I had no clue because I really assumed that a lot of movies like these made in the 70s included low-budgets all the time.<br /><br />A Thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical Patty Myers who lives for what comes her way until her husband and nearly all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture everyone warned her about. At first the movie isnt all based around her until the rapture happens. What it leads up to are showing that everyone else around her are becoming christians and believing in Christ which is usually what happens to a lot of people. Everyone around them they once knew and loved will be gone forever and the one who is left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves. No one can ever blame themselves because theyre always right.<br /><br />Just like these whiners who complain about the movie. These people must be full grown adults. Im thirteen and you dont see me whining especially since I was exactly like Patty before I re-accepted Christ into my heart. For those who havent seen it if you want a little bit of everything tossed into a Christian movie instead of stereo-typical everyone else is wrong movies than youll enjoy A Thief In The Night. Dont knock it before you try it. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.',pos
'OK its watchable if you are sick in bed or have nothing else to do. The suspension of disbelief required to get through this movie is significant though. First in todays modern society do you believe college coeds get THAT committed to someone in that short of a period of time even if you are a virtuous Habitat volunteer who likes autistic kids? And the 2 week romance blossoms into a letter exchange that leads to Johns conflict of whether to re-enlist right after 9/11/01...REALLY? He asks her what to do? Every guy we know was NOT gonna be sitting on the sidelines after those Towers came down(my husband was one of them and I love him and am proud of him for going) Johns character is so flat. Hes nearly expressionless the entire movie. Hes good looking but not Spec Ops...he seems unsure not confident quiet instead of a hell-raiser no tattoos gets into a fight with the preppy boys that is nothing more than a pushing match really...walks around without a cover on his head nearly the whole movie...and there are military technical flaws everywhere (epaulets upside down?). The war scenes are dumb...John and another guy heading off on their own...huh? then other guy gets shot and John drags him 10 feet and starts giving buddy aid before securing the area or back-up arrival or even having their backs against cover...its a gunfight for Gods sakes you dont stop fighting until its over...heck I wanted to shoot John in the back. Back home when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine...we hated her for removing her shirt in his presence...WTH? break his heart and THEN tease him into adultery? Shes a head case trollop. Best part of the movie is when he drives away from her...at least he had some self respect and honor there. Overall unbelievable story and we generally did not care about these characters or their love. Dismal!',neg
'I have heard an awful lot about The English Patient and I finally decided to get the CD and find out what all the ballyhoo was about. What I found out was a cinematic delight and should I repeat should always be watched with an open mind. If you are a religious moral zealot I am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates. As I remember correctly before I watched this film I read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who I quote said that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got. When it comes to morality I agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. <br /><br />I must admit rarely have I seen such a wonderfully crafted film. I keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First and foremost this is a love story and yes its an extramarital affair (moralists beware) but lets not keep focusing on that. Instead lets focus on how the story was told. Its an admixture of flashbacks and the present. Its set in the world war II and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) who is looked after by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in war torn Italy just before the beginning of the end (defeat of the axis powers). The burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks set in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that youre sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer. The locales in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I am a romantic and am not ashamed to say I had tears after it ended. Watch it with someone you truly love. The movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a womans body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god! Why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all the destruction of Innocence. <br /><br />Anyway it deservedly won a bunch of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works of director Anthony Minghella.It kind of brings back the romanticism in the David Lean genre of films.It almost reminds me of Lawrence of Arabia which was also based in the desert.Happy viewing folks.',pos
'Black Water is one of the most tense films I have viewed in a long time. The story moves fast as it follows three tourists (all great actors) into a swamp on a tour with a butch tour guide on a small boat. Soon after dropping anchor in a remote area of the swamp they are flipped over by something huge in the water.<br /><br />Hastily the three manage to make it into a tall tree nearby as they realize that a crocodile has attacked them. Throughout the next two days they have to desperately try to escape from the crocodiles evil watchful eye and he doesnt seem to want to go away. The movie drags just a tad bit but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget? Its so much better than Primeval and other recent crocodile/ underwater predator thrillers. The tension is heavy and all three leads give terrific performances. Truly chilling this movie struck a deep chord of claustrophobic fear in me. Apparently based on true events.',pos
'Okay heres the deal. Theres this American pilot whos flying along minding his own business when suddenly hes outnumbered by evil cowardly non-American fighter planes (theyre Middle Eastern types but suffice to say they dont like apple pie or Elvis Presley) who proceed to shoot him down. Now this American pilot was doing nothing wrong but those evil non-Americans didnt care and before you know it hes banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death!!<br /><br />Now what would normally happen here is that the US Military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released but not this time. Those evil peace lovin types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre. As you can imagine this doesnt please the pilots family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug contented look about him. Hell make those Americans pay oh yes indeed!<br /><br />But He didnt reckon on Doug Masters the captured pilots 16-year-old son. You see Doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car (which cant be that long) and decides to fly into that evil foreign country and get his Dad back. So with the help of his friends Doug and his wingman retired pilot Chappy Sinclair Doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners. <br /><br />Now youd think that this plan would be bound to fail but youd be wrong. Sure those Middle Eastern types might be all veteran pilots but Dougs got an ace up his sleeve he listens to rock music when he flies! After shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery Doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane. Understandably the evil not quite so smug anymore dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself in bid to shoot down Doug. But the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky. HURRAH!<br /><br />After Doug and Chappy have shot down 90\% of their air force the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot Doug down but in the nick of time a flight of US F16s turn up and scare them away.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film enough. It was the first ever videocassette movie that I brought and until I was twenty I kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that I could rescue him. But hes doesnt like flying so it didnt happen.',pos
'If this movie had been directed by a man he would have been jailed. While Adrian Lyne was shackled with a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the gutting of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors and to avoid running afoul of the Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996 a woman dumps Ripe on us and everyone applauds. Did I miss a meeting? In addition to the blatant pedophilia this movie is utterly preposterous. Has this woman never set foot on an active military base? Has she never met a soldier? Whose army is this? The uniforms must have come from Uniforms-R-Us. Just throw on some patches who cares? Just make sure each and every one of them has a Big Red One. There is a slight inside joke here that no doubt went over the auteurs head but might possibly have been slipped in by whoever furnished the military vehicles. Certainly there were no military advisors. The U.S. Army does not operate slums. Temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner than this. The U.S. Army does not put 14-year-old girls to work on military bases nor allow them to use the firing ranges or training courses. There is much drama to be mined in the sexual coming-of-age of teenage girls. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with that whatsoever.',neg
'To begin with I have to admit Ive never been a big fan of the Dutch movie-genre. Unfortunately watching De Dominee hasnt made me change my mind. It shares some common flaws like having a plot thats too predictable and linear for my taste. <br /><br />Worse however is that the cast has their dialogues as if they were stage-actors in a play. Unfortunately this is common too in many Dutch movies and at least to me makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main characters.<br /><br />The actor that plays Adri (Im sorry I forgot his name at the moment) is at least delivering a decent performance and is one of the reasons I dont rate this movie even worse.Another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget and the production seems professional. <br /><br />Ironically the fact that the acting is often too articulated might not be so much of a problem if you dont speak Dutchalthough I already warned you that the plot isnt spectacular either but at least it might make it an acceptable movie to watch.',neg
'Many reviews here explain the story and characters of Opening Night in some detail so I wont do that. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life.<br /><br />At the beginning Myrtle Gordon is remembering how easy it was to act when she was 17 when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally fragile wondering what her life has been for and indeed if she can even continue living. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her.<br /><br />Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself (Im going to bury that bastard she says of fellow actor Maurice as she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtles director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows however that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all.<br /><br />Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on Myrtles downward path. I believe this is truly her opening night - she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action she sees a way forward. It is tremendously moving.<br /><br />Gena Rowlands is superb. The film is superb. Thank you Mr Cassavetes wherever you are.',pos
'I saw this film right in the middle while going through a breakup. It was about 3 in the morning and I was battling insomnia with a quick snack. It wasnt too bad at the time but every time I have tried to watch it since I cant get into it like I did that night.<br /><br />At the time I thought it was cute and I loved the variety of characters though they totally could have done better than Goran V in my opinion. But the one thing that kept me watching was Heathers character and her sad commitment to her husband who didnt want her anymore which made me feel sorry for her and root for her at the same time. (Considering I was in a similar situation at the time perhaps thats why I liked her so much.) Not a bad film but you pretty much have to be somewhere near the character romantically in order to appreciate it and lets hope you never are.',neg
'I couldnt believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips. Assy drinks too much and plays by his own rules as you might have guessed. The only other funny moments are Assy shooting manymany people and spending time at home - in the bathroom. It is not Squidbillies funny but it is worth a look.',pos
'What can I say about this movie that has not been said by all the other comments here they pretty much sum up everything the people who love it cherish it the people who hate it... well they loathe it. This is the movie equivalent of Marmite.<br /><br />I personally have committed every second of it to memory it is cyclical claustrophobic introspective magical and stands as being one of the most unique films ever made. Despite what many have stated I believe this truly is a cult movie it is a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered once unearthed its fantastical psychedelic visuals and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable which is an achievement in itself. One of my friends who watched it likened it more to a musical and in many respects to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made would probably get more out of it to view Head as such.<br /><br />I was always fond of the Monkees especially the T.V. show back when it was repeated during the 80s. My mum had recorded Head for me when it was shown on T.V. late night as she knew I liked them I watched it a day later and it lodged in my memory until I was able to find a copy on DVD about 2 decades later what I would love now is a special edition it would be fascinating to get a greater insight into the making of this masterpiece. We can only hope.',pos
'I like Hack. Think the Lone Ranger reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver a decent but flawed guy in Philadelphia doing his best while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past and youve got the synopsis. David Morse is nearly perfect as Olshansky. He helps people but instead of riding Silver in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary Philly without handing out silver bullets. The supporting cast is first class and well above average. At times the witty dialog almost reaches the level of that 70s classic series The Rockford Files. This show deserves a return hopefully in a better time slot than 9PM Friday(eastern).',pos
'Well I like to watch bad horror B-Movies cause I think its interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie. (I always compare this movies to - for example - some Spielbergs works and again-and-again dont understand the huge difference in what I see.) I like Ed Woods movies cause its so inept its very funny. But people!!! The Chilling is not funny and is not even interesting. Its EXTREMELY BORING horror movie without ANYTHING what makes even bad movies watchable. Theres no acting no screenplay no direction no thrills and not even blood. Its extremely inept amateurish film. Its definitely the WORST movie I had ever seen (and I had seen a lot of worst movies - believe me). I warned you !!! 1/10',neg

'One of the all-time great science fiction works as visionary and thought-provoking as Blade Runner or even Gilliams own Brazil. Willis gives his best performance here but hes outdone by Pitts incredibly frenetic turn thats unlike anything hes done before or since. Even Stowe isnt out of her league here though. The story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about. The climactic scene is beautifully magnificent and the last lines fit perfectly. The scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way. Lots of dark humour on display here. Fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography. In my top ten.',pos
'Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event even though he did save many other captive children. The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways bathrooms and even class rooms. In other words the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren(Sam Decker) plays the soldier/school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field. However the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB.

'I am having a hard time finding the words to explain just how much I detested this movie. The historical trial of Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and the Duc de Praslin is a tragic and compelling story that I feel had the potential to be a fantastic film but failed. <br /><br />Although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself it in no way could make up for the terrible structure of the film the badly written script and most of all the horrendously overacted characters. The worst of them were the Ducs children who were so over-the-top-corny and sickeningly fake that it was almost painful to watch.<br /><br />In conclusion this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and profoundly disappointed.',neg
'Ive had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one. THIS IS IT!<br /><br />Make no mistake this film is awful.<br /><br />Heres a list of reasons:<br /><br />Hopeless storyline (despite being based on a true story). Dreadful acting (what was Judge Reinhold thinking) Unbelieveably bad stunts. Childish dialogue. Non-existent continuity. Lack of atmosphere.<br /><br />Get the picture?<br /><br />',neg
'I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed.<br /><br />Its true that Frank Sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but its also nice that its not just another Frank Sinatra movie where its mostly him doing the singing.<br /><br />I actually thought it was better to use Marlon Brandos own voice as he has the voice that fits and I could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice.<br /><br />Stubby Kayes Sit Down Youre Rockin the Boat is a foot-tappin sing-a-long that I just love. He is a hard act to follow with his version and I still like his the best.<br /><br />Vivian Blaine is just excellent in this part and Adelaides Lament is my favorite of her songs.<br /><br />I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part it made sense.<br /><br />Michael Kidds choreography is timeless. If it were being re staged in the year 2008 I would not change a thing.<br /><br />I find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage even though it was on film.<br /><br />I thought the movie was well cast. I performed in regional versions of this and its one of my favorites of that period.',pos
'Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of worn out VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name written on top. I think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties was because of Sandra Bullocks name. Bullocks fans dont have to disappoint. Sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting. Rest of the movie Its fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because its bad but after that its going worse. Much worse. Directing is awful. Acting is awful. Script is awful. Dialog is awful. Action is awful. Music is quite good actually. Typical score for eighties action movies. This movie is so bad that it goes close to anything Andy Sidaris has ever produced. Its so bad that there isnt proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie. But still there was Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /><br />I think they can now bring the film out on DVD. It could be cool!

'From watching the trailer the movie looked pretty interesting. The production of the movie is also pretty good--it looks like they had a good budget and doesnt look like a cheaply made movie. The acting ranges from good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to bad (James Haven as Don).<br /><br />The actual content and plot of the movie is weak. The movie starts out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed disappointingly boring twist. Watching the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie OK but everything in between makes this an absolutely boring movie to watch. Its as though they made a short movie then tried to force it to be over an hour long by stuffing the middle with an hour of filler material.<br /><br />If you want to waste a good hour and half of your life watch this movie. Otherwise stay away from this extremely boring movie.',neg
'Is a big struggle. As a story that is surreal this movie couldve been great (as great as it is rated by some here) but mixed with the acting (director and relatives playing major roles due to financial reasons I reckon) found in here ... although calling this acting is not only a stretch of that word its giving it a new meaning! A whole new meaning! <br /><br />If you are into surreal movies (there are some that I do like actually see the Japanese Strange Circus for example) you might be able to overlook the flaws (see above) and enjoy this more. There are great ideas here after all! Many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes but while watching this (with a group of friends) almost all of us just couldnt stop laughing ... not the intention of the director of course! Again everyone has their own liking as one can see by the high rating of this movie but I could only recommend the movie if youre aware of the work that Alejandro Jodorowsky has done and/or are a fan of his!',neg

'This is a made-for-TV and rather needless Sci-fi Channel retelling of the Beowulf story especially after the recent 2005 film Beowulf and Grendel. This movie doesnt really get into Beowulfs story but just takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as Grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior Beowulf is called upon to rid them of the monsters rampage. If this is successfully accomplished the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay. After a few failed attempts the creature is slain but its angry and vengeful mother soon attacks leaving it up to Beowulf to again lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it. Grendel looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the CG effects are terrible. Like I said this movie is absolutely needless.',neg
'Darling Lili is a mixture of Perfection and Magic! The Stars; Julie Andrews & Rock Hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried.

Jackson plays a blues singer/musician--whose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother along with aborting a child he had hoped to have with her.<br /><br />Christina Riccis character is a woman who was sexually abused when young--this has turned her into a self destructive nymphomaniac; allowing men to treat her badly.<br /><br />The story lies in the intersection of these two characters lives.

'The movie had a good concept but the execution just didnt live up to it.<br /><br />What is this concept? Well story-wise its Dirty Harry meets M. A child killer has begun terrorizing a city. The lead detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never dealt with a serial killer before. The Mayor and the Police Chief in desperation secretly hire the local mob to speed things up...to go places and do things that the police wouldnt be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible.<br /><br />To be fair this film DOES genuinely have some good things to offer.<br /><br />Besides the concept I liked the look of the killers hideout. Norman Bates has his basement. This guy has an eerie sewer. In some of the shots the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls; often giving these scenes a creepy dreamlike quality.<br /><br />The acting was good too. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age.<br /><br />Once you get past that however it more-or-less goes downhill.<br /><br />The film is paced way too fast. The actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating. This could have been fixed in two ways: either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots. Either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery.<br /><br />For an example of how bad this is one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this: at one point in his life the suspect went to a pet shop...Thats right...Im being totally serious here. Its like they went from point A (the first clue) to point Z (the suspect) and skipped over all the in-between steps.<br /><br />Then theres the characters. The only ones I actually liked were two pick-pockets you meet about half-way through the movie. Considering that theyre minor characters Id call that a bad sign.<br /><br />Finally theres the mob angle. This is the one that gets me the most because THIS is why I coughed up the $3 to buy the DVD in the first place. I mean what a hook! Theres been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 10-15 years. The mob angle was a gimmick that COULD have helped it rise above the rest... but it didnt.<br /><br />I figured the gangsterss methods would be brutal but fun and thrilling at the same time; kind of like a vigilante movie or something...maybe theyd even throw in some heist movie elements too. We ARE talking about criminals after all. Instead were given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid. The detectives question witnesses. What does the mob do? They interrogate and kill them. Its not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either. I actually found the criminals less likable than the killer theyre hunting.<br /><br />Unless the good points I mentioned are enough to get your interest Id say give this one a miss. Maybe some day theyll reuse the same story idea and do it RIGHT. I hope so. I hate to see such a good concept go to waste.',neg
'This film is terrible and dont blame Jesus Franco because its not his fault.<br /><br />This film was shot silent over many years by Welles as he got the money to bring a crew and the actors together to do some shooting. How much film Welles actually shot is not clear although not all of the film or all of the sequences are here since several key sequences such as Quixote in a movie theater are in the hands of collectors or backers who wouldnt give them up. The film here is just under two hours and I would be hard pressed to imagine it ever really working at any length. Im of the opinion based on several comments that Welles made before his death that he never really intended to release the film but was putting it together as a personal toy.<br /><br />What exists here is for the most part is beautifully shot but dramatically dead. Very little happens for the first hour other than Quixote and Sancho wandering around the country side. Dull would be a kind description of the material. In the second hour Quixote ends up in modern Spain and in a series of not very good sequences deals with everyday life. This isnt to say that there isnt a few nice moments the windmill and the chicken sequences are quite good but mostly this is a vast waste of film and time.<br /><br />Completed by Jesus Franco who was Welles assistant director on the vastly superior Chimes at Midnight we have a bunch of film fragments that have been put together as best as possible. Many people have crucified Franco as having been the reason the film stinks but frankly one can not make a good movie from crap material. One critic has gone on record as having seen a different cut of the film in the 1970s which meant that Franco made this version up on his own and ruined it. While that maybe true Ive run across stories of Welles cutting and re-cutting the film many many times over the years since he could never get it right.<br /><br />This film is terrible no matter how you slice it.<br /><br />Ultimately Im left wondering just how good a film maker Welles was. Aside from Citizen Kane almost all of his films have been plagued by lack of budget or interfered with so we are left with the excuse that many of his films would have been better if only.... How do we know? How can we know? Perhaps Welles was a man of less talent than we thought and many of his borderline films just arent that good and never would have been. While this is no place to argue the place of Welles in film history the surviving material of Don Quixote assuming it approximates what Welles intended (I think it does) is a good case for rethinking how we view the man and his work.<br /><br />4 out of 10 for the good sequences (though 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality)',neg
'Typically terrible trash from director Fred Olen Ray about a female cyborg hunter(Teagan)commissioned by Warden Jan-Michael Vincent to find and execute escaped alien convict Ross Hagen who has charted course for earth.

'I read the other comments here about this movie before watching it. If youve read them you will know that they are almost all negative. I really dont understand that. I admit that it is far too long (it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit). The music is often inappropriate. But strong performances by Ford and Thomas are indeed enough to carry this. With all his fame as a movie star Id forgotten that Harrison Ford really can act! This role as a man who has defined himself based upon a lie is remarkable. I find it completely believable that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was deception. Thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception. Her initial denial which leads to confusion and then to inner calm is tremendous. This movie is never going to be on anybodys list of great flicks but it isnt that bad. Im glad that I waited to see it on video but it is worth the $3 or $4.',pos
'My opinions do not flow with the majority in most cases. I tend to lean toward the artsy imaginative and different. This movie was reminiscent of Frances Fords The Black Stallion wherein a fantasy situation is created to showcase the beauty of a magnificent creature whos not readily available to view performing at its peak except on these multitudes of documentaries ala natural. Unlike those nature films this offering utilizes the finest movie making techniques the industry has to offer fit for a diva creating one of the most sensual super stars (the cat) on the screen.<br /><br />This fantasy depicting the love relationship that develops between a french soldier (he is very nice too) lost on the Egyptian desert and a female leopard he encounters when he chances upon an abandoned Egyptian temple is mesmerizing. I bought into it wholeheartedly. If you are the least bit open to fantasy and appreciate the grace beauty power and sensuality of the feline you should enjoy it.<br /><br />The only flaw in my book was the ending. It was a perfect set up for a Romeo and Juliet finale - that would have taken me over the top.<br /><br />',pos
'Some things just wont stay dead. They just have to keep coming back for more whether we like it or not. I guess some people like to beat a dead horse. The first Ghoulies was a surprise hit and its first sequel was an even better film. The third film took a more comical approach and by this point the little buggers were starting to overstay their welcome. I guess someone out there in Hollywood thought it was a bright idea to resurrect the franchise but the outcome will likely disappoint fans of the previous entries.<br /><br />Pros: The acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this. A silly but fun score. Moves at an alright pace. Some cheese for those who love it. Some pretty good action-packed sequences. Has a bit more plot than the others and unlike II & III at least attempts to link itself with the original.<br /><br />Cons: Not nearly as much fun as its predecessors. Though it has more plot than before its a pretty ridiculous one. Poor effects. The original Ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here theyre replaced with two trolls who serve no purpose other than to be comic reliefs. Speaking of comedy all attempts at humor are lame. Is a direct sequel to the first film but there are so many loose ends. For example I thought Jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original? Not that it was spectacular in the others but this films direction is especially bland.<br /><br />Final thoughts: The first three Ghoulies movies are a bad movie lovers dream. This fourth and so far final sequel (Lets hope) is a bit of a letdown. Sure theres some fun to be had but it just isnt the same. The others are low budget too but the people involved put a lot more into them. See if youre a completeist or you wanna see beautiful women in skimpy outfits. Otherwise just stick with the other three.<br /><br />My rating: 2/5',neg

Thrill as they put the kibosh on international heroin smugglers Polish fugitives peeping toms philandering girlfriends renegade dogs and litterbugs who are too lazy to bin their recyclables.

'Director F.W. Murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of native islander life in the South Seas. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie. The landscapes are beautiful and the daily life activities of the islanders are interesting to watch. The film loses momentum though when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. The storyline just never gets that interesting despite being handled well by Murnau. Won an Academy Award for best cinematography although the award probably should have been for best scenery. You cant really credit the DP for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location.',neg
'Dressed to Kill (1980) is a mystery horror film from Brian De Palma and it really works.The atmosphere is right there.The atmosphere that makes you scared.And isnt that what a horror film is supposed to do.All the actors are in the right places.Michael Caine is perfect as Dr. Robert Elliott the shrink with a little secret.Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller the sexually frustrated mature woman is terrific.Keith Gordon as her son Peter is brilliant.Nancy Allen as Liz Blake the call girl is fantastic.Dennis Franz does his typical detective role.His Detective Marino is one of the most colorful in this movie.There are plenty of creepy scenes in this movie.The elevator scene is one of them.There have been made comparisons between this and Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho (1960).There are some similarities between these two movies.Both of these movies may cause some sleepless nights.',pos
'This film plays in the 60s and is about an Italian family: Romano his wife Rosa and their two children Gigi and Giancarlo emigrate from Solino in Italy to Duisburg in the Ruhr area. I like this film because I think it is quite realistic: it shows problems which many foreign families have when they come to another country: they have to get used to a new culture a new environment and this can be difficult: especially if you dont know the language.... It is difficult for the family but they find a way: they open a restaurant which offers typical Italian food and it is named Solino like their hometown. The film also shows different conflicts - Gigi and Giancarlo fall in love with the same girl and although Rosa has to work very hard Romano refuses to pay money to engage more workers etc. etc. But stop I dont want to tell you how it goes on. You should watch the film yourself its a nice one - I have also made a Referat about it and examined scenes which show different cultural attitudes. And there are a few...',pos
'Remember - before there was Sidney there was Dudley.<br /><br />Dudley Digges is barely recalled today - because his heyday as a fixture in sound movies was the late 1920s and through the 1930s. Except for one major performance: the ships good natured if tipsy doctor in the 1935 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY most of his films are barely revived. Mores the pity because he was a wonderful actor. In 1931 he played Casper Gutman (the original actor to play that villain) opposite Ricardo Cortezs Sam Spade in the first THE MALTESE FALCON. Similarly about the same time he played the recording angel in Leslie Howards version of OUTWARD BOUND - the same role that Sidney Greenstreet tackled in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS a decade later.<br /><br />Digges could be likable and lovable (that ships doctor again) or detestable (in CHINA SEAS as the judgmental First Mate sneering at poor Lewis Stone but then proving hes as big a coward in a moment of crisis). He held his own against Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES. He is the Chinese freedom fighter working with Gary Cooper in THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN. Digges could do anything. <br /><br />Here he is Mr. Thompson the hypocritical and thieving warden of a reform school that Frankie Darro and his friends are sent to for committing a robbery and injuring a Greek-American store owner (it is the latest incident for most of them). Digges is as bad here as in CHINA SEAS but it is a close thing to totally dislike him. Hes able to somehow transcend his roles...more later about that.<br /><br />Darro has a gang of urban delinquents (including a Jewish boy and Farina from OUR GANG). As pointed out in another review it is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see them shake down car owners to pay them to watch and protect their autos. When one guy wont do it they calmly wreck his car. The snatch and grab robbery at the store of the Greek-American is also rather graphically shown - his skull getting fractured when pushed. <br /><br />The boys are rounded up and brought before stern but decent judge Arthur Byron who realizes that he cant leave the kids with their parents: the parents are unable to watch them or are incompetent. Unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence: a Jewish father who is more concerned with his business than with his son Farinas stereotype Yassum father and the an Italian father whose willingness to cooperate gets his son out of going to the reform school.<br /><br />Once there the boys find the regime oppressive. Occasionally one of the guards or the nurse (Madge Evans) tries to speak up for them. But Digges has no time for coddling. His is a regime determined to break the boys so they behave themselves. Unfortunately Digges and his bookkeeper partner are greedy. They have been serving inferior food to the boys and pocketing the profit. <br /><br />One day a new official comes from the state to look at the reform school. Its Jimmy Cagney who is a hack ward heeler whose gang got the vote out for Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he could not get the Park Commissioner post) Cagney was made an Assistant school inspector. He is supported by his hanger-on pal and factotum Allan Jenkins (in his first Warner Brother film). <br /><br />The irony is that if Digges were a bit more careful Cagney would probably have let him continue running things. But Cagney arrives to see Darro brought to Digges for fighting. The Warden and Darrow have had problems about respect earlier and Digges now intends to punish Darro who flees - but get seriously injured by Digges barbed wire fences and his free use of a whip. Cagney stops Digges and lets Evans treat Darros injuries. And she explains the reality of the situation to Cagney and her own idea of real reformatory reform of the boys by building up trust in them with responsibility.<br /><br />The film follows this to the end showing that Cagney and Evans are on the right path turning the reformatory as a republic for the boys to run properly. This leads to conflict with Digges whose profiteering is reduced as he is no longer getting supplies. But the scheme is derailed when Cagney himself finds he may be in serious trouble with the law. Digges sees his opportunity and fully takes it. But then he goes too far...far more than he ever bargained for.<br /><br />The 1930s had many films showing kids taking steps to right wrongs and change things. Darro appeared in such as WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille did THIS DAY AND AGE where the kids teach a lesson to a gangster played by Charles Bickford that scares the hell out of him. So it went in the 1930s. THE MAYOR OF HELL reaches a similar intensity of vengeance and juvenile justice seeking. But thats the one problem of the film. Digges character is a knave and hypocrite so we never really cheer for him yet if he wasnt a thief we might go along with his view (even if it is counter-productive). The scenes at the start of Darro and his gang preying on people actually make the harshness Digges would follow seem fairly understandable (even if his thieving ways are not). Also he has one moment when hes justifiably angry at Cagney - at that point in hiding from his own clash with the law - giving orders over a phone from long distance to a befuddled Digges. When Digges learns whats actually happened he is justifiably furious at Cagney lecturing him about proper behavior. It is the closest thing to making Mr. Thompson sympathetic in this fine movie.',pos
'I was lured to see this movie by its starpower but ultimately thats all it delivers. It plays much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption. Its greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow along as they fall like dominoes. The film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex but has forgotten to substitute good clean romance or excitement in any other way. All the flavor of a good flat decaffeinated diet cola. Q&A which also takes place in New York is a far better alternative as is LA Confidential.',neg
'Whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching this depends how you like your horror movies. If you like them so god damn awful theyre hysterical watch away. Jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie ive seen in my life (and ive seen Long Time Dead) and i say this as a fan of the low-budget horror/gore genre and having seen a good few to compare it to. Im not even going to go into the specifics of what makes this movie was bad as it is the only good thing about it is its so so terrible its one of the funniest things ive seen in years.

'as a retired USAF MSG (aircraft maint. spec) this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the fact that a teenager could ever get on the flight-line much less get into an f-16 is ludicrous. the military spends millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this movie makes the air force and all its members seem stupid at best. yes i know it is only a movie but it conveys a message to the younger folks that we are all idiots and believe me we are not. the logistics involved in setting up any type of mission are highly involved even in the eighties military computers were too secure to hack by any teenager and the other flaws in this movie make peter pan more believable. sorry to me this movie has no entertainment value at all.',neg
'Did anyone who was making this movie particularly the director spare a thought for the logic of the story-line? These are not mere plot-holes but plot graves that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight. That is if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave-hole plot or boring and unlikeable. Or in the case of Downeys & Hannahs characters apparently superfluous. In pondering the reason for existence of Downeys characters significant screen-time in the movie I decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screen-time (unlikley as the director didnt change anything else about the script he actually needed to) or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting. Ill leave you to guess which one it was to be.<br /><br />I had to keep checking the cover of the DVD to confirm that this really was made by credible talents. I cannot understand why Robert Altman would take this job. Surely he has some power to pick and chose. Actually I cant understand why anyone would take this script on except a first-time director looking for the experience.<br /><br />I suppose Robert Downey Jr. needed the money for his habit. I suppose Kenneth Branagh wanted to try a southern accent. I suppose Robert Duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing. These are the only motivations I can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie. As for Robert Altman plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic. I found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eyes movements or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood. I do not typically notice such things in movies since most movies I bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story-telling and interesting characters with understandable motives. I watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that DVD cover and being convinced that due to the talent involved there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie.<br /><br />Nice direction. But thats not why I watch movies.',neg
'This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee film Ive seen. I say pretty much because I have also seen Soldier in which he plays the villain... but from what Ive heard its not considered a Jason Scott Lee film. This however is. And if this is any indication of the quality of such films I wont be seeing any of the others. Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist... as the lead hes awful. He gets in a fight with random no-name characters every few minutes of the film probably because the script writer couldnt figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film. The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality and aside from the fact that hes certifiably insane he barely seems like a villain at all. The majority of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain through time... or maybe its the other way around. I cant say for sure... and I definitely wouldnt watch it again to make sure. The effects are not completely horrible... but its close. The title comes from the popular idea of using a time-machine to go and kill Hitler. Somehow the film screws up that interesting idea as well. The plot is too complicated for its own good. The pacing is poor. I cant think of one positive thing to say about this film... I really cant. Its simply too formulaic and pointless. If only I had a time-machine so I could go back and prevent this film from ever being made... no never mind. I just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to fans of Lee and no one else. If youre looking for a quality film... well this isnt it. Thats for sure. 1/10',neg
'As someone has already mentioned on this board its very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill pacing patience directorial distance a plausible premise a narrative flow and REALLY believable acting (aka GREAT acting). <br /><br />Such is not the case with Love Machine. It starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch) and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. Its downhill from there.<br /><br />Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon. But to be fair to Eriksen his problems started early: as he explains in the extras he began wanting to do a REAL doc couldnt get funding and settled for a cheaper way of making his film.<br /><br />The premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98 when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy host hand-held cameras zooms grainy blacks and whites -- all I guess to elicit a sense of authenticity but it just doesnt work. The film is confusing and forced but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue.',neg
'Although I really enjoyed Jim Carreys latest serious performances (The Truman Show Man on the Moon) Ive always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy. This is not to say he is a fantastic talented actor: those bozos at the Academy Awards seem to dislike him so much he has never had a (truly deserved) nomination or award. Well any institution that nominates for 11 Oscars a bore such as Titanic shouldnt be taken seriously.<br /><br />On with the review. The Grinch is the sweetest best looking best acted more enjoyable seasons film since The Nightmare before Christmas. Both movies seem very similar too with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing Christmas. Both make their principal actors seem like the villains (one in a higher degree than the other) both pack a strong moral lesson and both are truly enjoyable.<br /><br />That is until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll and The Grinch is a human being. But a human being that is so incredibly expressive so fluid in his movements so cartoon-like so unreal that never gets in the way of the movie. He can be hilarious he can be a sad soul he can be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world where 3-dimensional people live. He jokes he laughs he cries and ultimately he saves the Christmas. I loved this film to bits and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those films you will really enjoy 10 20 years from now. As timeless as they come.',pos

'This movie was a littttle confusing at first. I usually like Gina Phillips but this one I have to say was a bad choice just like her doing the movie Ring Around the Rosie that one also not one her good movies. Jeepers Creepers was way better. Anyway Faye Dunaway was good. She totally creeped me out and at the end that was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi(Phillips) who comes to her twin sisters funeral. She stays at a house that her sister owns and her grandmother(Dunaway) lives at with an Aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen(Dunaway) is kinda sacrificing her relations to stay alive and as long as she wants to live she cant die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her which she tries. Ravens have a weird part in it. When the relations go to sleep the Ravens eat there organs so they cant go to sleep. But they do. Basically it all crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relations will be buried but not dead b/c they have to suffer forever so Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yeah I hope this helps.

'Lets not kid ourselves this atrocity is not Plan Nine or Cat Women. It is bad period! The performances vary from drama school theatrics (Marla English) to a couldnt care less walk through (Tom Conway). The photography (even in a good print) is so murky it is occasionally hard to see what is happening. The real problem however is the aimless pointless nearly plot less story and the leaden paceless direction. At a brisk 77 minutes it still feels endless.<br /><br />The screenplay is especially inept. There are two story lines that only intersect at the very end of the picture. Tom Conway is trying to create a super race using voodoo and modern science (although there is little science in evidence) which he can control telepathically. He is keeping his wife prisoner (for no discernible reason). Meanwhile a couple of petty crooks and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village in which he is working in the expectation of gold and jewels. When they finally arrive Tom Conway decides that one of them the woman is the perfect subject for his experiments. She is turned into a monster kills Conway (natch!) and then reverts to normal. She sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool tries to retrieve it and falls in the water and apparently drowns. The white hunter rescues the wife. In the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again; threatening a sequel (now that really is a scary thought!).<br /><br />The AIP producer Samuel Z Arkoff in a lecture included on the DVD prides himself on spotting the teenage niche market and satisfying it with ingenious low budget movies. However it is difficult to see how anyone could think this rancid concoction would satisfy any sort of audience. What appeal do they think it could possibly have? The monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film. The jungle action is tepid and tedious. There are no teenagers in it and no characters that teenagers could be expected to identify with.<br /><br />The producers exposed 77 minutes of film but they didnt make a movie. This is a con trick and Arkoff should be ashamed of his association with it.',neg
'I did something a little daring tonight when I watched this movie. I attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores. Sure when this film originally was distributed a piano score was probably played with it. Oftentimes the director would choose the score himself (Charlie Chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films). But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released. And then again there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score. I do not know the history of Potemkins score so I decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within - film. <br /><br />Soon after I turned the music off unaided (or should I say unimpeded) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen I became utterly attached to the film. Visually it is easily one of the most stunning of all films. Eisenstein was a master of composition. The editing possibly the cinematic technique Eisenstein is most famous for (montage) is extraordinary. The mood of this film is anger and it stirred my passions violently. <br /><br />It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film especially a drama but films like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it. Come on! You owe it to yourself to watch this film! Your education is incomplete without it.',pos
'The Book gets 10 out of 10 stars...<br /><br />PROBABLY CONTAINS SPOILERS OF BOTH THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE!!!<br /><br />If youve never read Geoffrey Households Rogue Male the source material for Man Hunt youll likely enjoy Fritz Langs treatment of the story. On the other hand if youre in my camp and have practically memorized the book the movie will be a crashing disappointment. Ill assume youve already read a synopsis of the story and proceed to my complaints. Households little novel is one of the all-time great suspense classics taut and spare with only a bare handful of characters to propel the action. Fritz Lang and his screen writer Dudley Nichols feel the need to throw in the protagonists brother and a sympathetic floozy the latter of which reduces the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the screenplay where the novel needed none. In fact the true climax of the book was not the nameless narrators escape from his underground lair but rather his self-acceptance of his true motive for going on his hunt in the first place. And thats another thing: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can get us all the way through Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists why cant Lang? Thorndyke? What hat did they pull that out of? Which brings me to my bitterest complaint: Households hunter is so quintessentially Britishhe would bleed a Union Jack if you cut him. But Walter Pigeon who plays him is Canadian! He can barely sustain the accent which is only slightly deeper and more convincing that Kevin Costners in Robin Hood. He looked about right in the role and was a fine actor for the 1940sbut as Rogue Males reluctant hero? Lets look to the Sceptered Isle itself for a more convincing version.

'I *loved* the original Scary Movie. Im a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel. I think the Wayans are a family of comical geniuses. Alas even geniuses make mistakes.<br /><br />The movie begins with promise. I liked The Exorcist parody especially the come on out ma gag. Now thats Wayans-quality material. But other than that I can only think of two other times I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile hes saying It was just a booty call!! That was kinda funny. 2) The Save the Last Dance parody where the Cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves. But even the short-lived giggles are no match for the side-splitting laughs of the first Scary Movie.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is pure trash filled with cheap gross-out gags. Jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone. For example in Scary Movie I several innuendos are made to imply that the character Ray is gay. This was hilarious. But in Scary Movie II the whole penis-strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly unfunny. This is the pattern of the whole film. Shock humor *alone* doesnt take a movie very far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001 unfortunately. <br /><br />As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low I have to give this one a 2 out of 10.',neg

'Jewel Thief is *THE* crime thriller of Bollywood and why should it not be? It is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in Indian Cinema Vijay Anand (Johny Mera Naam and Teesri Manzil.) I could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance):<br /><br />1 Vijay Anands direction 2 R D Burmans music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuris lyrics<br /><br />Even if Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie it definitely has bond babes. Helen Tanuja and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos.) But our sauvé Vinay (Dev Anand) is anything but Bond. He is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes him almost always as confused as we are. He even flirts with Anju (Tanuja) trying to hit her romantic nerve just so that he can get employed in her fathers shop.<br /><br />Dev Anand might be in a double role - well I dont want to spoil your movie or else I would have told you. That is what most of the mystery is about. Dev Anand works in a Jewelry shop and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work - though is not or at least has a perfect alibi. We wonder who did it is it Dev Anand as Vijay the person he claims to be or is it Amar someone we have not yet seen but many people claim is his look alike. Comes Shalu (Vyjayanthimala) who even claims that he is her fiancé in a tense situation Dev Anand has to prove that he is Vinay and not Amar. While everyone wonders if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar he is asked to remove his socks. Amar we are told has 6 digits on one of his foot. While we watch with bated breath the events that are about to unfold Dev Anand even finds time to joke. <br /><br />The real life brothers Director Vijay Anand and Actor Dev Anand have many movies between them this is not the best of them but definitely the best in Crime Thriller. <br /><br />There are moments of Hitchcocks North By Northwest but the movies are very different. Except for the confusion about who is who a treacherous female lead and lot of traveling there isnt a lot of similarity. Dev Anand could very well be Amar in addition to being Vijay. People have seen him they identify him where ever he goes. There are too many of those people for this to be a fraud. Finally Vinay thinks it is better to carry along with being Amar to find out what is the truth and it is a sad mistake. He gets too deep into it only to be saved by the twists of Cinema.<br /><br />When I watched the movie as a kid I was definitely not amused the ending confused me completely. Even now there are parts about the ending that I do not like but Id recommend this movie anyway.<br /><br />Even as a kid I enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer. Yeh dil ... - a definite loafers song in Kishor Kumars voice. I could hear Rulake gaya ... whole day long. Ditto for Aasmaan ke neeche which is set under the skies of Gangtok (at least the story line suggests that). Raat akeli hai among the sexiest song to come out of Hindi cinema featuring Tanuja as the seductress. Meri taraf dekho - Helens cabaret and we look at her. Hothon pe ... - now could there be any better thriller of a song than this. As the song progresses we are more tensed than we ever were and the words hidden in Shalus lips add to it.',pos

These women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and as another reviewer said they act like gold-digging hooches.<br /><br />This is not liberated womanhood and Im glad its gone. 0 stars and just plain AWFUL',neg
'Ive loved this movie for a LONG time. I hadnt seen it in a while so I again checked it out and actually found it even more enjoyable now. I loved the Chipmunks cartoon when I was young so naturally I adored The Chipmunk Adventure.<br /><br />I honestly cant think of a better plot to this movie. Its not wildly creative but Ive always wanted to travel all over the world and so I just have so much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more. The part with Elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry...<br /><br />The Chipmunk Adventure will remain a favorite of mine forever Im sure. I guess its because I saw it when I was so young. I dont think it would make quite an impact on someone older seeing it for the first time. (Unless of course they have a young heart)',pos
'This movie seems to send the wrong message. There can be morality without using Christ. Poeple of other religions I believe can get into heaven. I am a Catholic who goes to church every week but I do not agree with such Christian arrogance. This is the worst time travel movie I have ever seen and Ive seen Timeline.',neg
'Overlong drama that isnt capable of making any real point. So she became an actress - so what? She learned to love - big deal. There is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations but the kind which is bad for the movie causing it to often seem absurd.<br /><br />Summer Phoenix playing the lead talks and behaves like a semi-retarded person so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended point. We are told early on (in that Barry Lyndon-like narration) that she learned to hide her emotions which certainly explains her autistic stone-face but the movie suffers for it. She basically walks around like a zombie and her success as an actress isnt quite credible given her lack of emotions. Occasionally the movie had that dull sleepy feel of a Dogma 95 movie. Is it one? I wouldnt be at all surprised.<br /><br />Summer Phoenix is sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late River Phoenix. Nepotism rarely works.<br /><br />If youd like to see my Hollywood Nepotism List with over 350 pictures/entries contact me by e-mail.',neg
'Paranoid Park is about Alex a 16 year old skater who causes the death even if accidentally of a security guard. As the movie goes on Alex deals with little issues like his parents divorce and the sexual heat of his girlfriend Jennifer(played by Taylor Momsen who you can currently see in Gossip Girl) while hes consumed by guilt. I had seen just one movie by Gus Van Sant so farElephant and I can assure you that he kept all his mannerisms while doing this one.Once again he crosses time lines.Once again he uses weird filming techniques like the never-ending shots of people walking...maybe you like these filming techniques I know I dont. The plot feels unsatisfactory to me...its almost to simple to be explored for such a long time. The feeling I get (same with Elephant)is that Gus Van Sant tries too hard to make an artistic movie which causes the movie itself to loose substance. Also Gabe Nevins was pretty bad as Alex theres a difference between looking alienated or detached and looking like a robot. If youre a fan of Mr.Van Sant then watch this otherwise skip it.<br /><br />3/10',neg
'Excellent show. Instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where its the same old thing just different stars this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations. We have been away from watching any television for 2 years and after coming back of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on W. Shame on Global for pulling the plug on this one. I thought this one would be a winner. Lets be realistic about things FEW Canadian SHOWS make it. Everyone I talk to enjoys this show and I believe it was foolish of Global to walk away. I guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the States instead of pulling behind a Canadian made show that had a lot of promise. Dont get me wrong I enjoy a lot of shows on TV but come on people lets keep the variety. This unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships with unique characters that you dont see on any sitcoms today or in the past. Too bad that global had to say no to this one foolish mistake.',pos

'The only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves. For viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three.<br /><br />The story is a slice of life about beached surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave but for any wave at all. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging super surfer who is flirting with a commitment with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the Bone Yard. The trouble is there are no waves until the very end of the film so most of the story dissipates itself on a meandering succession of disconnected beach happenings.<br /><br />The acting is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has a few comical moments but mostly his acting was mundane. Ewan McGregor was decent as the drug dealing wild man by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch. Probably the funniest performance was turned in by Peter Gunn as Terry who turned his corpulent body into a continual sight gag. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual but her character didnt really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability.<br /><br />There is really not much here on which to comment. I rated it a 3/10. Its a real beach bummer.',neg

'The 40 Year Old Virginmade me laugh a lot. I dont care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy I just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as the virgin nerd Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest specially because it is real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famousby the way.<br /><br />Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. He is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys but seems harmless. One day while playing poker with his friends of his work they discover that Andy is in fact...virgin! And he is already 40 years old! After this surprising revelation all his friends are trying to make Andy sleep with a woman...the problem is the confusions in which Andy gets inspecially now that he is really starting to like Trish a woman he met when she was buying a DVD player in the store he works at.',pos
'This deceptively laid-back low-key casually paced Aussie crime thriller unravels with a casual ease and relaxed self-confidence thats a delight to behold. Eager beaver working class kid Jimmy (an appealingly feckless Heath Ledger) yearns to make something out of his unrewarding ordinary life. Jimmy gets his big break when local crime kingpin Pando (an outstanding Bryan Brown) assigns him an easy courier gig which entails delivering $10 grand to an old lady. Jimmy finds himself knee deep in serious trouble when he loses Pandos money. Writer/director Gregor Jordans engagingly simple tale of how things arent always what theyre cracked up to be young love all actions having consequences and that hoary old chestnut about how crime doesnt pay works like a charm thanks to a wonderful wealth of well-observed minor quirky details a strong subtext concerning mans duel capacity for both good and evil a nice sense of unforced irony the chillingly matter-of-fact way the violence is presented and the marvelous grounding of the assorted complexly drawn wartsnall low-life characters in an instantly recognizable and totally believable banal day-to-day reality (e.g. Panda is shown playing Scrabble with a flunky and at one point interrupts a business conversation with a fellow hood to talk with his son over the phone). Judging from his finely shaded and two-fisted portrayal of the cunning not to be trifled with Pando Bryan Brown undoubtedly qualifies as one of the finest actors to ever grace celluloid. A sturdy and satisfying little sleeper.',pos
'This movie is a riot. I cannot remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies. Ive seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny. But this one is wall to wall great lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in. The movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up. Other than that its a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations. Id like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the Zucker movies where you dont get all the jokes the first time around. You have to see it two or three times to get it all in.<br /><br />As far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit its choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that. All the characters are great. Its not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable. No victims in this movie. Also thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film. You just wish that women like her really existed. Shes not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbite.<br /><br />If you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it. I assure you the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give away all the good jokes. Just some of the mediocre ones.<br /><br />Oh and one more thing. I hope critics put this on their top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies dont get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they dont put it on their list. This means you Ebert!!!',pos
'Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written funny coincidences ordinary gangsters who are family men resemble something from Tarantino which is a good similarity!<br /><br />Anyway the films about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang and ends up in a debt and deep s*it. To his assistance is his deceased brother (anyone remember Val Kilmer in True R.?) to pay of his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail. The gangsters are cold blooded but take the time to play chess and focus on the upbringing of their children! They also get served tea from their granny while planning a bank robbery and have trouble what to do with their kids during the robbery. So a humorous gangster flick with Heath Ledger in good form (though Im not a fan)  and Bryan Brown in great action as a gang leader.',pos
'For some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion . Someone makes a film about a killer shark then all of a sudden the film world`s oceans are awash with giant Squids  killer octopusses and sea monsters of every ilk . A man is stalked by an erstwhile lover from hell then every film character is stalked by a cop from hell or a flatmate from hell or a babysitter from hell . Then when a major Hollywood company produces a big budget FX laden blockbuster about tornados then other film producers jump upon the bandwagon  the fact that they don`t have the budget to pull it off doesn`t stop them. NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a case in point . What struck me about this made for television film is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting to the ad breaks . Everytime a tornado appears the camara locks onto the horrified expression of the actors as they scream things like  Oh my gawd it`s heading this way  and  Run for your lives  then the screen fades to black saving the producers the need to up the special effects budget . Unfortunately NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS budget should have been upped to include better actors . The cast are by no means bad but they are unimpressive and lack the skill to carry a film which is character driven . Where`s Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them ?<br /><br />And the last word on this being a TWISTER clone ..... Yes NOTT was released a couple of months before TWISTER but TWISTER had been hyped for several months as being the Summer blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT has a rushed feeling to it which leads me to believe that it was made and released to tie in with the hype surrounding TWISTER',neg
'Sam OSteen the film editor on the superlative suspense flick Rosemarys Baby from 1968 here directs a quickie TV-made sequel one in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin in for Mia Farrow) is shunted off early--and inexplicably--presumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about Satans son on Earth. Most interesting is the return of Ruth Gordon to her Oscar-winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland well-cast as her husband Roman) but she isnt given much to do--and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway. This script is strictly low-rent goods and must have shamed original author Ira Levin (who went on to write his own sequel). Fairly dim and pallid with poor photography and no suspense or scares whatsoever.',neg
'Im a massive fan of prison dramas which is reflected in OZ being my all time favourite American TV show . I guess the appeal lies in a type of smug voyeurism of wanting to see bad things happen to bad mens bottoms  but I found Don Siegels RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 to be rather disappointing . Okay I knew since it was made in 1954 it would be devoid of bad language  graphic shankings and gang rape but even so its a rather weak film compared to prison portrayal in earlier movies like EACH DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT . The problem lies in the preachy tone of the movie with riot leader Dunn being something of a prison reformer . Yeah that sounds ridiculous since hes a violent anti hero rather than some limp wristed tree hugging do gooder on a salary  but thats what he is in essence  he wants to see prisoners rehabilitated to rejoin society rather than being made to suffer . Theres also a problem of making a B movie with such radical themes ( Quite ironic that Siegel would later make DIRTY HARRY where the only good criminal is a dead one ) and that is the cast isnt very good with Emile Meyer as the warder being especially irritating in his performance . like i said a disappointing movie',neg
'Early in the movie Cagneys Johnny Cave character tells his gumshoes in the Office of Weights and Measures that in the previous year unscrupulous shop owners had cheated the American consumer out of more money than the aggregate National War Debt! Then he goes out and tickets a particularly greasy green grocer for short-selling him a bag of sugar that is four ounces off (oh the horrors!!) and one skinny chicken that his butchers scale has rather generously proclaimed to be six lbs. after which the fur--or in this case feathers--flies. Er fly. When a racketeer in politicians clothing attempts to derail an investigation into the paltry poultry purveyors practices our hero becomes a lone wolf waging the war of the weights on behalf of housewives across America. After all four cents here and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have anarchy! Word of his intransigence soon reaches both the Mayor and the Governors offices and Cagney becomes a marked man. If it sounds silly its not--the dishonest retailing practices are only a plot tool (or as Hitchcock would say the McGuffin) and while unfamiliar it works every bit as well here as any Treasury Agent or G-man anthology in which the fight is taken to shady crooks who are operating outside the interests of the countrys common good. The production standards are decidedly Grade-B but it is Cagney who makes this movie the delight that it is: this was his first film away from Warner Brothers after seeking release in court from his unreasonable contract and he seems to be at ease and enjoying himself tremendously--the performance turned in here is intelligent and crackles with his unique energy and surefire charisma. Mae Clarkes presence lends a definite Warners feel to the overall production. The supporting players turn in solid performances and the story moves along smartly after a rocky introduction that seems to begin three or four reels into the story--but sit back and enjoy it for the Cagney showcase and engaging Depression-era time capsule that it is.',pos
'Lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch Garfields gritty breakthrough performance (introducing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would carry over to the Brandos and Clifts and so on after the war) but all that sisterly affection is a bit suffocating. Priscilla Lane is a bright engaging performer but the other sisters dont really register (though theyre all allowed to be tart and witty) and I just had a hard time buying any of the other male characters besides Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant enough actor but he lacks the movie star weight to match up with Garfields hard luck Mickey Borden and that throws the film a bit out of whack. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart or someone in the part.) Also I was not convinced that Garfield would make the pivotal (to say the least) final decision that he made. The film needed another half hour of running time to better explain that action; it feels awfully rushed and under-motivated.<br /><br />Still its not hard to understand how anybody who grew up with this picture would remember it fondly. It falls short of being a classic but it does contain a few classic moments. The two gate swinging scenes are pure movie magic.',pos

'A space ship cruising through the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently adrift in space. The crew investigates hoping to lay claim to its cargo and acquire the ship. However once aboard the ominous vessel their own ship mysteriously disengages leaving them to fend for themselves and battle none other then Count Dracula or Orloff as this creature calls himself.<br /><br />Not a bad start. I mean it follows any number of typical sci-fi/horror plots. The genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably invoke comparison to some other film. But when you start with a fairly typical horror convention the legend of Dracula and vampires in general and combine it with a fairly typical sci-fi convention a crew happening upon something and becoming marooned to battle whatever theyre forced to confront the filmmakers better have some clever up their sleeve to imprint their own mark on the familiar genre staples.<br /><br />Director Darrell Roodt who also wrote Dracula 3000 with Ivan Milborrow is primarily responsible for this utter failure. So no Roodt and Milborrow have nothing up their sleeves but their arms.<br /><br />This film begins ominously enough with a very poorly delivered voice over by Caspar Van Dien essentially providing enough exposition to explain who the crew on his ship are. I should also point out that Van Diens character is named Van Helsing. And oh so very cleverly this Orloff character is from planet Transylvania in the Carpathian System. No kidding. I mean come on guys we get it. And again dont be goofy and use such names unless you got something special in store.<br /><br />So after Van Helsings introduction of the crew we have essentially a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking about.<br /><br />Im a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films. Occasionally they can be brilliant see Raimis first two Evil Dead films. Dracula 3000 had a decent budget enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of 3rd stringers like Van Dien Erika Eleniak Coolio etc. However unlike the EVIL DEAD flicks there is no talent behind the camera. In front of the camera the talent is marginal but Im going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt. It really seems like they dont know what to do. The best actor of the bunch Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld gets killed off quickly and the ever-enjoyable Udo Kier is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video journal. Grant Swandby is also okay as the Professor but its hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair. And yes its a WHEEL chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it. As for the rest of the actors well.Im sure Coolio really tried to be scary after getting turned into a vampire but well I dont think irritating qualifies as scary in most peoples book. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak dont really provide much either. Lister is never really more then the IL big brawny black stereotype. Eleniak actually appears unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard. Eleniak is a pretty girl even in her mid thirties but looks a little worn out and uninterested for the movies duration.<br /><br />This brings us to Count Dracula/Orloff played by Langley Kirkwood. To be honest I cant recall who exactly the vampire is supposed to be. He introduces himself as Orloff but at some point he acknowledges himself as Count Dracula as well. Go figure. In any case you will be absolutely astounded by just how lame this vampire is. Have you ever scene those cheesy horror show hosts local networks would have on their creature feature time slots? Yes its that bad. Langley Kirkwood the actor playing Orlock must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit. Im sure hes still getting hassled by his friends.<br /><br />There isnt much to the plot. The vampire is the last of its kind and wants to go to Earth for some reason and also there is some lip service about wanting to defeat Caspar Van Diens character Van Helsing. Most of the crew get turned into vampires including Van Helsing and the crew use conventional machine guns and pistols to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine. Yeah thats right bullets and yes the year 3000. Keeping in that baffling vein one of the main areas the crew hole themselves up in while battling the vampires or vampire since there is really never more then one threatening them is filled with old Soviet posters and insignia and such. What the? There are also references to God/religion being antiquated systems. But these references only confused me. Did the Soviet Union make a comeback? Is there some point Roodt and Milborrow want to make with this? It never really goes anywhere seems dumb and the posters etc. just look cheap.<br /><br />On the positive side the film is competently shot and edited. The cinematography is nothing spectacular but its clearly done by professionals and I had no problem with the special effects. The ships look like ships in outer space. Although as I write this I recall how god awful the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him. What were they thinking? Why didnt someone say something? See how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without falling back on the negatives? I guess ultimately thats the thing. Whatever positives you try and grant this sci-fi/horror debacle you become overwhelmed by its lack of quality.<br /><br />Poor Udo Kier.',neg
'This movie is not that interesting except for the first ten minutes. The pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece even better than say Gosford Park. Then it inexplicably slows down loses focus and starts resembling a traditional French movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story several threads started are not ended.<br /><br />*******SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relation between Antoine and Cécile. He has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago despite her remarrying and setting up home in Morocco. As builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of Céciles marriage. Having accomplished this he is buried after a freak accident (literally) and becomes a comatose. He wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that theyve reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together. *******END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />It remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of Iraqs former regime. Céciles child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) once he meets his boyfriend whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick (of that?). Her sister is traditional Islamic and enters a relation with Céciles husband. It portrays Morocco as unnecessary backward despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past. It portrays Islam as backward and prone to extremism which may sometimes be true but certainly not in general. In the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and lart pour lart.<br /><br />Deneuve and Depardieu are great. With this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene: lifting an eyebrow body language radiating pride awkward behavior. The movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of French cinema in the world nowadays. With some notable exceptions of course.',neg
'Really I liked it. The premise was good the story fit where both respective series left off and heres my favorite part. Mary and Valerie arent bitter! They arent like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey The Partridge Family). In fact Valerie was saying that shed be thrilled to do another movie and then Mary said the same thing later so I would be on the look for another...but if that doesnt quite work out then they can re-run this one.',pos
'This is one of my all time favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.<br /><br />I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie shes a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She really sucks you into her life. I also certainly cant fault any of the protagonists acting or anyone elses in the film.<br /><br />The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is really cute and didnt make me blush tooooo hard! One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor. Jess parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.<br /><br />Feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. Theyre funny theyre refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~',pos
'Made after QUARTET was TRIO continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by Maugham. Here the three stories are THE VERGER MR. KNOW-IT-ALL and SANITORIUM. The first two are comic (THE VERGER is like a prolonged joke but one with a good pay-off) and the last more serious (as health issues are involved). Again the author introduces the film and the stories.<br /><br />James Hayter soon to have his signature role as Samuel Pickwick is the hero in THE VERGER. He holds this small custodial-type job in a church but the new Vicar (Michael Hordern) is an intellectual snob. When he hears Hayter has no schooling he fires him. Hayter has saved some money so he tells his wife (Kathleen Harrison) he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop. He has a good eye and his store thrives. Soon he has a whole chain of stores. When his grandchild is christened by Hordern the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex-Verger. The payoff is when bank manager Felix Aylmer meets with Hayter about diversifying his investments. Ill leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting.<br /><br />According to Maugham he met a man like Max Kelada (Nigel Patrick) on a cruise. In MR. KNOW-IT-ALL Kelada is a splashy friendly and slightly overbearing type from the Middle East who is on a business trip (regarding jewelry) by steamship. His state-room mate is Mr. Grey (the ever quiet and proper Wilfred Hyde-White) who is somewhat silently disapproving of Max. Max likes to enliven things and soon is heavily involved in the ships entertainment. At this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non-Maugham story and film CHINA SEAS (1935) as Max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake (after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real). I wont describe the way Max rises to the occasion.<br /><br />SANITORIUM is the longest segment. Roland Culver plays Ashenden (the fictional alter-ego of Maugham - a writer and one time spy as in Hitchcocks THE SECRET AGENT). Here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health. He finds a remarkable crew of people including Jean Simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman Finlay Currie as an irascible Scotsman John Laurie as a second irascible Scotsman who is at war with Currie Raymond Huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up and Michael Rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness. Culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions. The last dealing with Simmons and Rennie is ironic but deeply moving.<br /><br />It was a dandy follow-up to the earlier QUARTET and well worth watching.',pos
'13 days to Glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the Mexican viewpoint. The major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor James Arness played the part of Jim Bowie persuasively the rest of the name actors in the cast Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were too old.<br /><br />Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle. The scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand. Failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military. Santa Anna was within his prerogatives to be angry. Raul Julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene.<br /><br />Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage.

'Paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. It does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.<br /><br />Unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife a conflict over a road construction project the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters a mysterious man who lives in the woods a bunch of racist hooligans at least three different carnivals the intricacies of local church politics and on and on and on. And all of that doesnt even include the actual central plot which is only about the hopes dreams and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. I was actually shocked when I realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours!) <br /><br />Ultimately the movie is melodramatic every plot point is predictable major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. Most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable twist) and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. Similarly a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another twist. Its all totally mechanical right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends (well not all of them just the ones the movie thinks you care about.)',neg

'I cant actually think of one good point in this film. The story is absolutely terrible. THe acting is as blunt as a carrot and the script is so bad it makes you want to kill yourself. OK fine if you love (and you have to love it to understand) snowboarding you might enjoy it microscopically better as it has large mountains and some cool moves but apart from that it is terrible. It has some absolutely stupid ideas and it is racist with both black and white people insulting each others races. The only time you will laugh is when you are laughing at the stupidity or you are feeling embarrassed for the film. I have seen a lot of films and i have to say that this is the worst film i have ever seen. If you have this film i would suggest you take it back to wherever you bought it from and get you money back.',neg
'How nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who marry in Las Vegas on a whim and then not only have to break the news to their kids but then have to try to meld their respective households (each has two boys and two girls)into a cohesive family unit. What transpires when the group which includes four teenagers two preteens and two younger children makes one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for Carrie and Jim. The fights between the kids (and one little love affair between two of them) make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along. More interesting than the Brady Bunch what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hours. Recommended as a feel good movie for all ages.',pos
'I watched this movie. To the end. And that was really not easy. It is so boring bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from BLAIR WITCH PROJECT that you cant believe the makers take this serious. Even harder to believe is how this product made it onto VHS and DVD.<br /><br />So if want to see a horror-movie just watch Scream but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability watch dark area.',neg
'At first I honestly thought it would be a corny movie. But after seeing this I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly funny along with the supporting cast (Especially that character played by Bullet tooth Tony from Snatch. What a contrasting role between those two movies!). Now im not one to say whether or not an actor is good or not but her act especially was thoroughly enjoyable. Even though the plot devolved into a teeny-bopper love triangle (though very funny) half-way into the movie I feel that this shouldnt discount what I think the movie really is: simply entertaining. So if you happen to stumble upon it whether by DVD or theater im confident that youll enjoy.',pos
'The Three Stooges in a feature length western comedy-musical? Perhaps Rockin in the Rockies was meant to combine the Stooges comedy short with the western musical in a matinée; if so this was a pleasant way to break up a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a handsome young hero; and Mary Beth Hughes (as the blonde June) and Gladys Blake (as the brunette Betty) are pretty women. The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group; their songs are quite tuneful; however this is the 1940s not the 1950s so the film doesnt exactly rock. There are a few laughs; but the Stooges brand of humor is more subdued than usual. The talking horse is also underutilized. <br /><br />**** Rockin in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard Larry Fine Curly Howard Mary Beth Hughes',neg

'Im a fan of good plausible action movies. And Im a huge fan of the elite military units such as the Navy SEALs. Finally Im a huge fan of Michael Biehn. Sadly none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time. I gave it another chance more recently when I bought the DVD. Heres the problems with this movie in a quick list: 1. Its a poor mans top gun for example including a virtual music video of the SEAL team playing golf with a soundtrack of The Boys are Back In Town which concludes with Charlie Sheen doing an inane chase to get his towed car back.<br /><br />2. This is quite simply a Charlie Sheen movie when Sheen was trying to be famous before he started doing stuff like Hot Shots. Reports Ive heard indicate that Sheen was a baby on the set and it affected the roles and Direction the rest of the actors in the movie got.<br /><br />3. Biehn is the head of the SEAL team yet Sheen seldom obeys him. Any SEAL showing the lack of discipline that Sheens character does or who endangered the team as he does wouldnt even have made it through BUDS training let alone gotten on a team.<br /><br />4. SEALs are cross trained on weapons. Yet in one part of the movie a SEAL has to figure out how to use a U.S. Stinger Missile.<br /><br />There are a few good scenes in the movie. The assault entry at the beginning Bill Paxton as God and some of the footage in what was supposed to be Beirut at the time. Overall though this movie is a loser.',neg
'Very funny film with some of the best swedish actors. Its all filmed in black and white with the true 40-ish feeling.

'This movie is not only a very bad movie with awful actors --or presumed actors-- a bored direction and a story unattractive it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent giallio Torso directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years before) one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of Italian cinema and a cult-movie around the world. In La Sanguinusa conduce la danza the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom. Naturally the scene in Rizzos movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in Martinos film. To put another black girl another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that Rizzos movie has no ideas no originality no taste and nothing at all. I think that such things are an offense to spectator.',neg

'This is my favourite Indian movie of all time. It is comic genius. Salman Khan is hilarious. But Amir Khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. Karisma Kapoors outfits tell a story of their own - makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier (at one point she looks like shes wearing a nappy). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. There is not one dull moment every scene is hilarious even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. I especially loved the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) regains his memory. Ive seen this movie so many times Ive lost count. And Im so glad to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as I know A.A.A it is not a replicate of a Hollywood movie (THANK GOD).

'This version did not move me as deeply as the later Hollywood version starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While it was beautifully filmed and superbly acted the BBC version was more packed with dialog that imparted information which I found fascinating. It gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual theological and moral considerations that motivated C. S. Lewis. It was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the Hollywood version but not nearly as visually stunning or viscerally affecting. Still while I did not leave a heaping mound of sodden Kleenex in the theater I did use one and at frequent intervals. I enjoyed this film every bit as much as the Hollywood version and was grateful for the increased understanding I gained.',pos
'Most Stoogephiles consider this to be the best Stooges short bar none and theyre right. Curly is a scream dressed up in drag as Senorita Cucaracha and Moe and Larry are in top form as Senor Mucho and Senor Gusto respectively. Christine McIntyres beautiful operatic voice is given full rein--she actually was a trained opera singer--and its wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is hilarious as a pompous Italian singer terrorized by the Stooges at a society party. Some truly funny gags good direction and very tight editing make this rise to the very top of the Stooges prolific output. Whats even more amazing is that Curly was having severe health problems at the time and in several of the shorts he made during this period you can see that he is obviously ill; his timing is way off he speaks very slowly and haltingly and has trouble getting around. Fortunately his health was in an upswing when he made this film and it shows. Classic Stooge comedy and enjoyed by even non-Stooge fans (I had a girlfriend who couldnt stand the Stooges but even she laughed at this one). A must-see.',pos

'Very Slight Spoiler<br /><br /> This movie (despite being only on TV) is absolutely excellent. I didn`t really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents so I can`t really comment on that. The acting in this was so good I had to pinch myself and say Remember it`s only a movie this DIDN`T REALLY HAPPEN. As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn talk I knew that it was exactly what John and Paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting. The offhanded comments and burns from John were right on with his character(especially in the restaurant!) as was his depression while Paul was very easy going and laid back. Both actors did and excellent job and I was thrilled to have seen this movie. It`s a wicked experience for any Beatles fan. And prepare for a few surprises!',pos

'I really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3. Its surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10 the other half 1. All the characters were entertaining and even talented but as a whole the film didnt pay off. Sebastian Hernandez is appealing; charismatic and likable (he even physically resembles Marc Anthony in a more approachable yet ultimately conscious sort of way...) but even he couldnt save this mess of a movie. Scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death. The banana scene fringed on self-absorption seemingly showing how much movement was in his boxers. But in his defense it was his first movie as director (that Im aware of) and I appreciate his labor of love. It just left me empty despite what was trying to be said. Ultimately I think the story would have been better handled by a more experienced director. From what Ive seen of the extras there is a real story behind this and perhaps when I finish watching them Ill appreciate this attempt more.',neg
'<br /><br />`<br /><br />5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters stories of war drag queens kangaroos and koalas and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land saying words like cobber and generally being the classic underdog.<br /><br />Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics such as Blackrock Moulin Rouge Chopper Yolngu Boy and Sample People.<br /><br />In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.<br /><br />Set in Sydneys Kings Cross Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town. Pando played by Bryan Brown is a Sydney Mob boss. Hes the king of organised crime wearing thongs carrying a stubby and helping his son with his origami. Hes vicious but real. As are his mob holding guns to someones head in one scene and then playing boardgames in the next. They are well respected and if they ask you for a favour you dont say no.<br /><br />Enter Jimmy played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is your average Aussie guy in his early twenties. Hes a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on anyones bad side so when Pando asks Jimmy to deliver $10000 Jimmy accepts.<br /><br />Things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal the money while Jimmy is at the beach. So now Jimmy is $10000 in dept to a major mob boss. From here we start to see all the interconnecting stories with Jimmy and his attempt at a bank robbery to recover the money Jimmy and Alex (the love interest played by Rose Byrne) Pando trying to find Jimmy and of course the two teenagers and their new found prosperity. The concept is deepened by the narrator Jimmys dead brother Michael who was killed by Pando and his gang years earlier.<br /><br />In the end all the storylines connected really well with a surprise twist to shock and stun the audience. I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />',pos

'I went to see this 3 nights ago here in Cork Ireland. It was the world premiere of it in the tiny cinema in the Triskel Arts Centre as part of the Cork Film Festival.<br /><br />I found Strange Fruit to be an excellent movie. It is a bit rough around the edges but for a low-budget movie that is to be expected! In general the acting (particularly from the main lead Kent Faulcon) is wonderful the cinematography and direction excellent and the script hugely entertaining and thought-provoking with some nice set-ups and witty dialogue.<br /><br />The ending was a bit sudden with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end ... but perhaps thats what the filmmakers were going for? It certainly did make the movie more unsettling. I did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen: it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will as in real-life sometimes these things are never settled. This was a good choice to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up!<br /><br />Taut and suspenseful throughout Strange Fruit is a hugely ambitious debut and I have high hopes for what the writer/director Kyle Schickner will unleash next. He - and his colleagues - are a talent worth watching.<br /><br />I hope Strange Fruit gets a wider release soon as more people deserve to see this movie an above-average thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in Americas Deep South.<br /><br />Highly Recommended: 7/10',neg

'How this has not become a cult film I do not know. I think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy!<br /><br />Runaway Car attempts to pass itself off as a fast-paced thriller but taking the quality of acting (good God its bad) the storyline the practicalities of the cars demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh. And laugh you will. Films are made to entertain us and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a films worth. This film is the pinnacle in entertainment I laughed from beginning to end. At one point I got short of breath and nearly choked it really is that funny at some points. When the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didnt rip the car roof to pieces I was laughing hysterically. But when the baby starting swinging around in the air nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree tears were running down my face.<br /><br />It also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played Jesus in Madonnas Like A Prayer video.

'Its one of the best movies that I have seen this year ! I dont agree with the person who said its boring. Of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all but personally I spent a very good moment. This movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes. There is also a nice touch of humor. For example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father and then her husband says how can someone abuse someone like you and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games :D Very funny !

'Bizarre. This movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer but everything that happens in this movie is fiction.

She seemingly becomes obsessed with him and falls for him. She puts her kids and husband second over the wolfman and even tries to incorporate him into her family gatherings. Some of the wolfmans freak show side kicks come over to visit and she mingles with them. The whole thing is very bizarre.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Nothing memorable. There is just something weird about a woman who gets her jollies from shaving the wolfman. I think you can find better films out there.',neg
'Where do I start? The box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt but Id been taught early on not to judge a book (or movie) by its cover so I ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway. But common sense should tell you that if they cant do a single still image properly then how dismal will the moving ones be later? Yeah. They were pretty awful.<br /><br />The actors in this flick appeared totally unaware they were being filmed as just any expression seemed to do fine regardless of the situation the characters were in or what they were reacting to.<br /><br />However a good story can offset the downfalls of low budget productions. Good dialog can carry a poorly-funded attempt at times. Unfortunately this was not one of those times as the story was as weak and nonexistent as the other required elements of good cinema.<br /><br />There simply arent words for how bad this was. <br /><br />Perhaps you can get the idea from my rating of -2.3/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.',neg
'I got this movie in a bargain bin hoping for an amusingly bad flick. Boy was I disappointed. (except for avon.) You see the movie is indeed horrible but so horrible it isnt even laughable. The plot oh wait there is no plot. I suppose you could say its about the main character rising up in the ranks of street fighting. At the end of the movie the directors decided to either not make any more sense or more likely died and had a monkey finish directing the movie. DONT READ IF YOU DONT WANT THE ENDING SPOILED! although the ending doesnt really spoil anything. The main character somehow ends up in a room filled with mirrors a la Enter The Dragon and then gets real angry has stupid flashback and hits a mirror. The end. Wheeee.<br /><br />The only redeeming factor of this movie was Avons scene. Hes talking to the rival street fighting boss and says something along these lines completely deadpan: Do not worry about him anymore sir. I have killed him in a sophisticated manner. I wined him I dined hm we went to a disco. We was havin a lot of fun. And then I killed him. at which point the boss says good work avon. Youre number 1. And avon says Number 1! Alllriiiiight! Alriiight! The scene continues with avon continuing to say alllrriiiight! over and over. The next scene is of a dead Avon floating in a pool. Intelligent? I think not.<br /><br />Lastly I own the Homeboy version of this movie meaning the title on the box I own is Homeboy. It shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and screaming. This never happens in the movie. This man is never in the movie. High quality.<br /><br />Note--I am new to this reviewing but hell yes I am going to keep it up.',neg

'Before I begin let me get something off my chest: Im a huge fan of John Eyres first film PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film a B-grade cross of both THE TERMINATOR & DIE HARD may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).<br /><br />Judge and Jury begins with Joseph Meeker a convicted killer who was sent to Death Row following his capture after the so-called Bloody Shootout (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  Meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store) being led to the electric chair. There is an amusing scene where Meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout) expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  Michael Silvano a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son Alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his sons coach). But once executed Meeker returns as a revenant (or as Kelly Perine calls a hamburger without the fries) whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making Silvanos life a misery.<br /><br />Let me point out the fact that Judge and Jury is not a true horror film. It is a supernatural action film with Meeker chasing Silvano using his ability to change form (which amounts to David Keith dressing up as everything from an Elvis impersonator a French chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache) a drag queen a clown & a stand-up comedian) a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesnt stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle) to pay Silvano back for killing Meekers wife.<br /><br />Director John Eyres does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of. But that is the films main flaw since theres nothing to connect the action scenes together. The acting is surprisingly good with Keith delivering the best performance supported ably by Kove as well as Paul Koslo who plays the washed-up cop quite well. Kelly Perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.',neg
'It was the Sixties and anyone with long hair and a hip distant attitude could get money to make a movie. Thats how Michael Sarne director of this colossal flop was able to get the job. Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film a terribly precious 60s-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon never mind a big-budget Hollywood film was in way over his head. David Gilers book is the best place to go to find out how the faux-infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyones eyes. If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another equally important vein. Watch this movie and youll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.<br /><br />Many reviewers have spoken about the inter-cutting of footage from other films especially older ones. Some actually liked these clunky comments on what was taking place in the movie others found them senseless annoying and obtrusive though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement. <br /><br />In my opinion the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say Sarne was so imagination-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They werent inspiration they were desperation. His writing skills were nonexistent and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie and he couldnt. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire films worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasnt able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the producers and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something some great spark of imagination a hint of originality a soupcon of wit to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus. Um oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye. <br /><br />As for myself I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarnes many betters poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them.',neg
'OK the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem i.e. the story started out in life as material for Buster Keatons silent classic 7 Chances. Comedy or acting in any genre for that much is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before if its not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget short time span of a film theyre handling things just fine. Regardless of what the credits say on their films real stooge-philes know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. Words spoken by Emil Sitka himself during a documentary about the boys. Here what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married is actually organized chaos. Every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. How many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery? Most obviously the Seinfeld crew but none others that Ive seen in the last 35 years of watching TV. The critics will always pooh pooh The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others but then again...who ever remembers the critics names or what they said? Simply watch laugh and enjoy!',pos

'I would almost give it 10 out of 10. However there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss-leading which hurt the flow/continuity of the film. The story line is great and well composed; you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it. The characters are complicated and so is the story line expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head its a film where all is explained in the end. The animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else Ive seen in animation. It is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so its worth watching it on a good T.V or plasma. The character voices do save this film in its English version but it would have been more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize that its happening Paris I enjoyed it more in French with English subtitles. One the whole its well worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it! And personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like; Waking Life & Ghost in a Shell 2 Innocence this is just a personal suggestion.',pos
'I had already heard of Ali G in Madonnas music video Music. I always think hes funny. (In fact he really is.) Just last year I always thought of buying a VCD of Ali G Indahouse. Thats why some months later I bought it cheap and I started watching it.<br /><br />But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy. It turns out that Indahouse is just a stupid piece of garbage. It was really really bad. It also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. It also didnt made me laugh even just a big smile. We definitely hate that movie. Oh by the way I have plans to sell it.<br /><br />Ali G was really different in his movie compared to his TV shows-- in such a negative way. Maybe he wasnt really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick. Just because theres some sex scenes in it doesnt mean its freaking hilarious (because sometimes too much isnt that laughable anymore). For the first time ever I was disappointed at him. That really made me sad rather and happy.<br /><br />I gave this movie 1 over 10. Actually I really want to give it a 0 rating. Its one of the worst movies Ive seen in my entire life. I wouldnt recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that arent too explicit or horrible.',neg

'The Couch Trip is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the 80s. In this case Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist and he goes to Beverly Hills to sub for Charles Grodin. Most of the movies humor springs from their satirical look at Beverly Hills and peoples empty lives there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid).<br /><br />Its the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time. Dont expect any kind of religious experience. But youll most likely laugh a lot at how the Beverly Hills people flaunt their wealth. Also starring Walter Matthau Donna Dixon Arye Gross and Victoria Jackson (of UHF).',pos
'This movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast a gripping story with a chilling ending great music and excellent visuals without significant special effects. It is interesting to note though that like so much science fiction its predictions for the future dont appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted. Thats not to say were out of the woods yet but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition. It shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: 1984 2001: A Space Odyssey (compare its space station with our International Space Station) and Isaac Asimovs I Robot (positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990s).',pos
'Admittedly when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie my expectations were pretty low. They werent low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow came into ownership of the rights to produce the Marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80s or early 90s and handed it off to Oley Sassone whose directorial work has largely been in campy TV series such as Hercules and Viper. With a supposed total budget of 1.5 million dollars it was produced shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of forgotten film. There it should have remained. However like a banana peel in a vaudeville act this Fantastic Four sits out in the ether waiting to cause a pratfall for those rare people unlucky and foolish enough to step on it. <br /><br />If you have ever heard of these comic book characters you know what to expect. The people who made this were very true to the source material and that is the only thing for which they deserve any credit in this fiasco. This presents the origins of the heroic group that develop superhuman powers when the shielding on their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes Mr. Fantastic. His girlfriend Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) can become invisible and her brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) can spontaneously cause fire to erupt from his body. Finally Ben Grimm (credited to both Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength when his skin mutates to a rock-like hyde and is then referred to as The Thing. There is a prologue that sets up a former classmate of Reeds Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) to become their enemy Dr. Doom who orchestrates the sabotage of the Fantastic Fours space flight as an act of revenge for injuries he blames on Reed. There is the set-up then the discovery of the powers the revelation of the villain and ultimately a climactic fight. There are more details to the poorly-written script but they are negligible.<br /><br />This is a movie that was made simply because the creators (I use that in the technical sense of the word. There isnt a whole lot of creative imagination at work here.) had the legal rights to do so. The plot will be undoubtedly mirrored in the anticipated big-budget release set to be directed by Tim Story in 2005 but tackling a massive special effects project like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of cinematic insanity. What special effects exist are mostly hand drawn or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original The Great Train Robbery. When half of the climactic fight reverts to full-on hand animation youre almost relieved to be watching a cartoon instead of the poor actors who were damned to be in this project. There is very little consistency of style in this mess as well. Most scenes are either shot flat in available light or wild primary colors and the only dressed sets are the obvious sci-fi pieces. There is camera-work but it is mostly just keeping the characters centered on the screen and minimal information flowing to the audience. Editing includes leaving in extra lines and using obvious wipes (at one point there is even a transition using the center of a number 4). Editing spins are even used to supplement the poor special effects when The Thing transforms. The one scene where morphing technology was put to use was shocking only because it was such a positive jump up in quality.<br /><br />Limited camera work is not unforgivable. In Clerks only the most basic camera movements are used and there is almost no style. It worked for that film because it was about people whose lives had no style and it was consistent. Kevin Smith never let his reach exceed his grasp. The Blair Witch Project caused some audiences to suffer motion sickness from the jerky hand-held stuff that put that pseudo-documentary together. When all was said and done it was an effective work about the terror of getting lost and being consumed by a frightening situation. There is no sense of story or theme here on either a spoken or visual level. With this Fantastic Four you never get more than an accidental laugh at the fact that the film makers and performers seem to be actually trying to rival other comic book movies with this poorly budgeted entry. <br /><br />Any film involves a great deal of time and work. It just so sad that so much of both was poured into a project like this. If youre one of the people who were involved with this it was most likely done as a stepping stone on the road of a (hopefully improved) film career. Everyone knows about taking jobs to make the most of what appears to be an opportunity. For those who are curious about watching this movie my advice is to only do so with a group of friends (so you can all point and say you watched it too) who have been forewarned about the experience (so nobody gets hurt from the shock) and maybe you can come up with a drinking game to ease the pain between the accidental laughs.<br /><br />1 out of 10',neg
'(Caution: several spoilers)<br /><br />Someday somewhere theres going to be a post-apocalyptic movie made that doesnt stink. Unfortunately THE POSTMAN is not that movie though I have to give it credit for trying.<br /><br />Kevin Costner plays somebody credited only as the Postman. Hes not actually a postman just a wanderer with a mule in the wasteland of a western America devastated by some unspecified catastrophe. He trades with isolated villages by performing Shakespeare. Suddenly a pack of bandits called the Holnists the self-declared warlords of the West descend upon a village that Costners visiting and their evil leader Gen. Bethlehem (Will Patton) drafts Costner. After much misery and numerous efforts to break Costners spirit he escapes thus ending a lengthy section of the movie that could have been told better in a three-minute flashback.<br /><br />We now finally get to the major premise: the escaped Costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town hoping to get some food under pretense of being a postman. A number of the village people led by young Ford (Larenz Tate) want to get in on this postman act which does not sit well with Bethlehem and his bandits and Costner finds himself the unwitting and unwilling leader of a band of postmen at war with the Holnists.<br /><br />The idea of The Postmen versus The Bad Guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds. The Holnists depend for their livelihood on the fact that the villages they prey on are isolated from one another; the Holnists can destroy any one village but could not stand against all their victims united. To unite the villages must communicate with one another and a working mail system would thus be a big step toward putting the Holnists out of business. So it really makes a lot of sense that Bethlehem would get medieval on our heroic mail carriers. Unfortunately Bethlehems eventual defeat is not the result of the villages uniting against him but instead your old standby cliche the one-on-one brawl between him and Costner. Nor is there even any real attempt by the communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems; all the mail seems to be the standard Hi Aunt Debbie stuff played for maximum sentimental value.<br /><br />THE POSTMAN is one of the most predictable movies shot for shot that I have ever seen. Now I dont purposely try to ruin movies for myself by straining to figure out whats going to happen next. But here were talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort; I just knew what was going to happen next whether or not I wanted to know. After a lion is prominently showcased eating people a Holnist bandit seeking the escaped Costner ventures into the bushes after a noise and we are then shocked when the lion eats him. A bunch of unoffending villagers are rounded up and shot by a firing squad and one of the villagers sings out some Famous Last Words right before being shot to my immense lack of surprise. A covered statue is unveiled to show exactly what everyone knew was going to be there: Costner bending to pick up a letter from a cutesy kid we saw earlier in the movie. A man tells Bethlehem that no sir you cant just take my wife; Bethlehem runs the unsuspecting sod through though he is the only person in the theater who is unsuspecting.<br /><br />But it is rank cloying sentimentality that really undoes THE POSTMAN. Olivia Williams playing Costners lover Abby is worst served. She pours her heart into the material and gives her very best effort to make it sound natural and sincere. She tries so hard its heart-breaking. But nobody could ever have made the lines I have a gift for you Postman . . . You give out hope like its candy in your pocket sound like anything but the syrupy pap that they are. Another example is the scene where a mounted Costner thunders past a little boy ignoring his proffered letter only to turn around stare at him for what seems like five minutes and then thunder back to pick up the letter. Why didnt Costner just pick it up the first time? No real reason; its just an artifice that tries and fails to give us a feeling of elation by dashing the kids hopes and then restoring them.<br /><br />Schmaltz and predictability unite at the end as the statue of the Postman is revealed. I sat thinking Please dont tell me theyre going to show the statue and then cut back to the scene with the cutesy kid. Surely that is too saccharine too obvious for even this movie. Then alas the music swelled and we did indeed cut back to the dreaded little boy smiling as his letter to his maiden aunt is whisked away and I held my head in my hands and thought Somebody shoot me. It felt like having thirty pounds of apple pie rammed down my throat.<br /><br />Gen. Bethlehem is a more humanized villain than normal. Your standard-issue post-apocalyptic villain is the meanest toughest S.O.B. in the valley. Bethlehem is shown to be a little nothing of a man inside who tries to make himself feel important by beating up on others. Although some menace is thereby sacrificed Bethlehem is credible in a way most villains arent. Unfortunately Will Patton overacts. And although we are told early on that Bethlehem utterly destroyed his last challenger in five seconds of hand-to-hand combat Bethlehems actual fighting skills shown at the end of the movie are absolutely ludicrous.<br /><br />The acting is otherwise pretty good. Costner has done better but his Razzie was an overreaction. As mentioned Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larenz Tate as Ford does a sincere and credible job. James Newton Howards score is competent though short of the epic standards the movie was going for. But its not enough to save this film.<br /><br />Rating: *1/2 out of ****.',neg
'The King of Queens could be divided into two eras.<br /><br />The first era constituted of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck.<br /><br />The second era increased the scope of the show addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin.<br /><br />But besides all of that...<br /><br />This show was freaking hilarious.<br /><br />Kevin James when not doing crap comedy films with Adam Sandler is a genius of laughter and his chemistry with Leah Remini was unparalleled on TV.<br /><br />Jerry Stiller as the psychotic live-in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor and Patton Oswalt as the man-child Spence Ulchin was amazing (hes a great comedian too) The King of Queens was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air and its a damn shame. Now all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of untalented actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance.

'CRY FREEDOM is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheids cruelty in just a couple of hours. Famed director Richard Attenborough (GANDHI) is certainly no stranger to the genre and the collaboration of the real-life Mr. and Mrs. Woods the main white characters in their book and in this film lends further authenticity to CRY FREEDOM. The video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part TV miniseries after the films initial theatrical release. While the added length serves to heighten the films forgivable flaws: uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular another possible flaw (the insistence on the white characters fate over that of the African ones) may work out as a strength. Viewing CRYING FREEDOM as a politically and historically educational film (as I think it should over its artistic merits) the story is one which black Africans know only too well though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact. It is the whites who have always been the films and the books target audience hopefully driving them to change. Now twelve years after the movies production CRY FREEDOM is in many ways a more interesting film to watch. Almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place 1987s CRY FREEDOMs ideals remain by and large unrealized. It therefore remains as imperative as ever for white South Africans particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it and absorb the films messages. In total contrast to American slavery and the Jewish Holocausts exposure South Africans struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories: CRY FREEDOM CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY (OK Count it twice if you include the remake) and SARAFINA (did I miss one?). All three dramas also clumsily feature American and British actors in both the white and black roles. Not one South African actor has played a major role white coloured Indian or Black!). And yes I did miss another international South African drama MANDELA and DEKLERK. Though this (also highly recommended) biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted MANDELA was played by a Black American (Sidney Poitier who also starred in the original S.A.-themed CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY) while the Afrikaner DeKlerk was played by a (bald) very British Michael Caine a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of Afrikanerdom is vehement anti-British feelings. Until local SABC TV and African films start dealing with their own legacy CRY FREEDOM is about as authentic as youll get. As villified as the whites (particularly the Afrikaners) are portrayed in the film any observant (non-casual) visitor to South Africa even now in 1999 not to mention 1977 when CRY FREEDOM takes place will generally find whites attitudes towards blacks restrained even understated. Looking at CRY FREEDOM in hindsight it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all and it is. But CRY FREEDOM at time shows not much has really changed in many peoples minds yet and that the Black Africans goal to FREEDOM and reconciliation is still ongoing. This is why if youre a novice to the situation CRY FREEDOM is your best introduction.',pos

'From the epicenter of the cultural globe four working class teenagers attempted to change the world through music and fashion. It was the final attempt to do so last century and they failed. Before the dust had cleared band manager and SEX shop proprietor Malcolm McLaren spent the money The Sex Pistols had earned to make a mockumentary about his own role in their success. The film was called The Great Rock n Roll Swindle (take the hint) and consists of very little footage of The Sex Pistols actually playing music and quite a lot of footage of McLaren effectively calling the audience idiots.<br /><br />Cod-surrealist nonsense in which guitarist Steve Jones is a detective on McLarens tail soon dissolves so he and drummer Paul Cook can jet off to Rio and spend time with great train robber Ronnie Biggs. Ready yourself for the spectacle of three very unappealing men dancing naked to a hideous irony-free version of Belsen was a Gas (a song about killing Jews for gold in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp) and another song sung in Ronnies tone deaf whine which includes the lyrics God save Myra Hindley God save Ian Brady (lyrics that Johnny Rotten would have considered distasteful). The Sid Vicious scenes are few and idiotic. Jumping out of bed in a thong with a swastika over the testicles to sing some bad boy biker song from the 50s. Playing into to the Punks a joke theme of the movie in an attempt to turn Sid into James Dean. Im surprised McLaren doesnt take credit for Siddys death too. The redeeming scenes are those of Sid in Paris and the infamous performance of My Way. The punk rock zeitgeist right there. Mocking an adoring audience before shooting them all. No need for an entire film just watch that clip on YouTube.<br /><br />From Julien Temples far superior (and more enjoyable) 2001 documentary followup The Filth and the Fury we were given a more balanced/honest view of what transpired in 78. But there were also a number of scenes that I would have liked to have seen in Swindle (as Fury was basically a reediting of the same material). One was an animated Sid complete with Sids voice acting; You f*cken betta watch out alright or Ill slice you open - a still of which appeared on the cover of the Something Else 7 inch - a snippet was shown in Fury but I dont know what context that originally appeared. Was it in original prints but removed after Sids death? Was there more? Fury also shed light on the film Who Killed Bambi which would have been the mock Hard Days Night movie McLaren was originally intending to make. It starred Sting(!) as a member of a gay New Romantics group and looked a damn sight more entertaining than Swindle.<br /><br />Sod Swindle tis a swindle. If you must rent The Filth and The Fury and revel in musics failure as a world changing polemic.',neg
'Nothing could be more appealing than the idea of a good love story featuring Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. The cool refined English beauty and the warm-blooded American male -- what could possibly be more lovely? Well this is not that movie. Right away they ruin it by casting Kristin Scott Thomas as an American Congresswoman. Thats like casting Hugh Grant as Babe Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is exactly the sort of woman you dont picture shaking hands with greasy ex-junkies in filthy slums or squeezing into smelly crowds and kissing babies. She would have been far better cast as the English born widow of an aristocratic Senator the kind who belongs to the hunt club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half lives.<br /><br />Then theres Harrison Ford as a regular guy cop. Certainly hes tough enough for the role. But the idea that hes going to romance this stunning high society beauty is a bit hard to swallow. Why couldnt he have been say a tough but wealthy reform politician with blue-collar roots who inherits Kristins late husbands Senate seat? The two of them are initially quite cool to each other but for dutys sake Kristin is cordial to him and he in return starts showing her some of the rawer side of life -- things her husband sheltered her from. Her political awakening coincides with the jolting passion of a newer more blue collar lover -- one who appreciates her polish and refinement far more than her aristocratic husband. Now thats a love story! Instead of that though you get a blank meaningless thriller where the action drags and nothing happens. Well there is one ghetto style drive by scene where Harrison almost gets killed but its so abrupt and unexplained its really more like welcome comic relief.<br /><br />The sky is always gray in this movie and our refined lovely Kristin always looks a little chilled. When shes supposed to be dreaming of passion she looks more like shes dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea! She also looks a bit sleepy most of the time like shed really rather be napping in the bed than screwing Harrison Ford.<br /><br />All things considered Id say you cant blame her.',neg
'More a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your typical dragged out biopic this fun and fabulous film has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indie-type film. I think the tendency would be to portray Bettie Page as some sort of sex vixen like a Jayne Mansfield. But if youve truly looked carefully at Betties poses she always looked happy. Not a you wish you could get with me haughty look nor the Im just doing this because my acting career didnt work out look of a porn star. And so the ladies involved with this film (three female producers a female writer/ director female co-writer and the lovely Gretchen Mol who Im sure helped shape this role with her own sugary influence) really captured the idea of a sweet somewhat naive southern girl who really enjoyed having her photo taken and hoped that good ol JC wouldnt be too upset with her. <br /><br />Gretchen Mol turns out a career high performance (she may just have the most perfect breasts ever) which I am happy about because she did have the curse. Several years ago she made the cover of Vanity Fair when no one really knew who she was touting her as the next It-girl. And lets be frank that was a bit presumptuous. I mean unfortunately she has never made it to Gwyneth status though not for lack of talent. Making a few poor film choices when you are a pretty blonde in fickle Hollywood renders you forgettable Im afraid. If this doesnt put her back on the A-list well Ill be a monkeys uncle.<br /><br />Intensely private Bettie herself has not seen the film yet. Bettie left the pinup party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame Jesus. Whatever floats your boat honey. You were one helluva woman. I hope youre happy wherever you are.<br /><br />Congratulations Mary Harron youve done our cult idol justice.',pos
'ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting Irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) went around claiming that he could beat any man alive. Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen.<br /><br />Raoul Walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of good humor. All the Warner contract players make up the fine cast--including the always reliable ALAN HALE as Flynns rambunctious father proud of his sons fighting abilities and ALEXIS SMITH who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking Flynn down a peg with saucy one-liners dealing with his conceited manners.<br /><br />All of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious B&W although its too bad Warners didnt have more faith in Flynn to do the film in color. He was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out.<br /><br />The fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen with Flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. And the scene where Bond turns over his award plaque to Flynn at a social gathering is one of Wards finest moments in a long career as a character actor.<br /><br />Summing up: Maintains interest all the way through whether youre a sports fan or not.',pos
'I am so happy not to live in an American small town. Because whenever Im shown some small town in the States it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless.

He meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her. But there is a tiny handicap she is already married to a very small-time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead.

'As an ordinary movie-watcher I cant say I enjoyed watching this one. Its not too emotional for a drama not too gripping for a thriller not too fast for an action. Plus some moments of the movie are hardly credible. OK I understand soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there but its hard to believe that a person would risk his life carjack into the middle of a hostile city and after being shouted at by a professors wife run away without having asked a question (in a proper way). It would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so but its supposed to be a SERIOUS film about war.. There are several episodes like this so the whole picture makes an impression that its just a raw preview of a movie and it needs considerable work.<br /><br />It feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier but all these curves of his psychology seem simply unnatural.<br /><br />This picture left a question in my head: WHY? Why they gave it an Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO its the most thrilling part of the movie :)',neg

'I was one of those few Americans that grew up with all of Gerry Andersens marvelous creations. Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action/adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it.<br /><br />I expected it to be a romp but I did not expect it to aim at such a low age group. Like Lost in Space this could have been both visually stunning and exciting. It should have focused on more action/adventure and the goal of the original series... saving people in trouble.<br /><br />Instead it focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers (who were cast too young anyway vs. the original). The breakout part was Lady Penelope and Parker. I didnt care too much for the characters in the original but I was grateful for them in the movie. They stole the show!<br /><br />I always enjoyed Thunderbirds more for the high-tech than the stories and even that did not get enough screen time as far as I was concerned.

'When Id seen the name of this movie Id always thought it was a musical. Like The Harvey Girls. Its not. Its a pudding that overcooked hit the kitchen ceiling and was pried off and cobbled together. No music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable.<br /><br />It starts with patriarch James Woods telling the eldest of his three daughters a small child who grows to be Barbara Stanwyck that she must maintain the family name and home.<br /><br />We thus think it is going to be a historical intergenerational tale. And it is for a brief time. Then it turns into the story of cold-hearted Stanwycks fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead set against him? Well why else? As we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by Stanwyck she had once thought she could inherit some money (for her sisters as well as herself of course) by marrying. She hit on someone she took to be a country bumpkin who was in fact budding lawyer Brent.<br /><br />Lest anyone think the child they had a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot is -- well you know ... They had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together he was conceived.<br /><br />One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young who is played by Gig Young. The other sister tries to take him away. Etc. etc.<br /><br />It is a shrill unengaging mess -- well enough acted but without a shred of logic or plausibility.',neg

I think that all the acting was well done the actors acted out their characters personalities perfectly. Everything fit together well. It really is a shame that their isnt a soundtrack.

On the outside these two man-hating mafia princesses (!) stop taking their medication and invite six slimeball ex-boyfriends over to their large country home for a party where theyre systematically slaughtered in very gory ways by a gloved leather-clad mystery killer.<br /><br />The hideous David Barton FX are so bloody but so unrealistic that they take on a sort-of surrealistic quality. Same goes for the movie. The dialogue is so strange and stilted the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so other-worldly youll start to doubt your own sanity. This film actually attempts to have a plot and three-dimensional characters but its all so poorly handled its almost like what would happen if Ed Wood did a rewrite of an Ingmar Bergman script! And like any good Bergman film this has a mature moral to abide by--Any good party needs a proper guy/girl ratio so there will be enough chicks to tickle your lizard. See it for yourself... or dont!<br /><br />Linnea (the only reason I was even interested in watching this to begin with) is very amusing in this one has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eye-popping nude scenes.

You dont get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters. And the plot evolvement is slow boring and yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins. Score/music is ultraboring imean there are alot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit but this is major crap. Some of the special effects are nice if it was made in early 90s. If you like Slimy Aliens chills and thrills dont whatch this movie. its a dull combination of the Thing Alien 3 Outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay production gone really really bad. Now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they where doing and the only ones on this production that knew that was no one.<br /><br />Though i have seen far worse i would not recomend this movie to anyone but if you are up one cold night and just wanna glanse at something it will pass the time slowly.',neg
'One of my favorite movies of all times have seen it three times already. It does a great job of summing up the Isrelai walks of life Israeli humor and seriousness and much of the problems Israelis go through. Universal theme of wanting to be accepted and be accepted for who you are. Good subtle humor and its the charisma of the characters that makes this movie magic and says a lot about Isrlaei culture and the irnonicness contradictions and humor with a great actor in it Oshri Cohen. I highly recommend it to anyone and its a movie perfect for practically anyone family movie boyfriend/girlfriend movie and also says apart from Israeli culture wanting to be accepted most of all how important family is with all its diversity and imperfections.<br /><br />Great great movie.',pos
'...and thats saying something. No matter how bad a movie gets Im normally able to sit through it so I can judge the full movie. Through this one I made it about 20 minutes.<br /><br />Maybe it was the DVD or maybe it was my laptop but I could not hear the dialogue even with the volume turned all the way up. Sound effects were fine so with the volume turned up to hear the dialogue I was blowing out my eardrums with the effects. As much as I wanted to see this thing through I wasnt going to sacrifice my hearing for it.<br /><br />From what little I could tell about the plot the movie was one big flashback by the main characters daughter. It seems the mother a military pilot had to flee her ship because the one person on her ship she trusted turned out to be one of the enemy and now he is pursuing her across a desert planet.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about the movie was the look of the main character; there was something I liked about her hairstyle.<br /><br />Oh well looks like this one is going into the dumpster...',neg

'My girlfriend and I have a thing for Robots. So I try to seek out movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Big ones. They beat the clang and bang out of each other with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. Its really cool. You have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. It is very hard to dislike this movie. Because of those big robots. They looked like Transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers! It made my girlfriend smile. And that is good enough for me. And special mention must be made of veteran character actor Paul Koslo: as the maniacal Russian Villain whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after theyve already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste like blood (a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-Bela Lugosi accent) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen. This is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation.',pos

I wasnt really sure if anyone could encompass all of the Popes many amazing qualities in a movie but the movie did his memory justice.

'This filmed presentation of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a most beautiful and interesting rendition of Coleridges haunting poem. The striking cinematography combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world famous artists and Michael Redgraves superb narration are very well worth the time to view this excellent visual work.<br /><br />In the age of television such work as this is an invaluable tool to induce young students as well as adults to explore and to learn the value of great poetry. To the best of my knowledgethis kind of work is indeed rare; that is regrettable. As a student of world literature and as a former college professor and academic counselor I feel that more great epic poems like Coleridges Rime of the Ancient Mariner should be so translated. Although not a movie critic but as an avid reader of classic literature I am glad to recommend this fine production without any reservations whatsoever.',pos
'Holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people. One of them I will name the other two are mysteries and will remain so. Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV. He is unlucky in life. Unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the Yelnats men and has been since exploits of Stanley IVs `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. Those particular exploits cursed the familys men to many an ill-fated turn. It is during just such a turn that we meet Stanley IV. He has been accused falsely of stealing a pair of baseball shoes freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction by a famous baseball player. He is given the option of jail or he can go to a character building camp. `Ive never been to camp before says Stanley. With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake.<br /><br />Camp Green Lake is an odd place with an odd philosophy `If you take a bad boy make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun it will turn him into a good boy. We learn this little pearl of wisdom from Mr. Sir (John Voight) one of the camps `counselors. We get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man. He at least wears his attitude honestly; he doesnt think he is nice. The camps guidance councilor Mr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson) is a different matter entirely. He acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor but he quick quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges. The Warden has a decided capacity for meanness but other than that she is a mystery. These three rule Camp Green Lake a place that has no lake. It is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes five feet deep and five feet wide. Its local fauna seem only to be the vultures and dangerous poisonous yellow-spotted lizards. Green Lake seems is in many ways a haunted place.<br /><br />Holes works in spite of the strange setting and the strange story because it understands people. Specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of Camp Green Lake. The movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly. It captures the way boys can bully each other they way they can win admiration the way they fight with one another and the way boys ally themselves along the age line. It is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable. What is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character. He does not believe in a family curse he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. In fact he loves hearing the story. Stanley IV is not bitter about the past and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather. There is at times a lot of sadness in the film but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness. And that is refreshing.<br /><br />Holes is an intelligent insightful and witty family movie. It entertains and not in any cheap way. It is not a comedy though it has its laughs. It dares to be compelling where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional. As such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy. I give it a 10.',pos
'I first saw Love in Limbo playing late on free to air TV about five years ago and since then its a movie Ill always remember warmly as one of those films you see and are forever influenced by.<br /><br />For the uninitiated Australian film has a long history of making off-beat comedies about lovable losers and Love in Limbo is a sterling example of this. Whilst Russel Crowe is the only name actor in it (although these days hes all a movie needs) the rest of the Aussie cast is good- he still steals the show as a nervous nerdy virgin loser though.<br /><br />The general premise is a lot like American Pie. A group of friends wanting to get laid and become men. As youd expect the entire movie focusses on this (with a sub-plot about the leads mother and various other incidents) and is full of humorous situations that push it towards the inevitably sweet ending.<br /><br />If you enjoyed American Pie dont expect this to be the same- but expect the same conventions to make appearances. Love in Limbo isnt a gross out romantic comedy- but it definitely has its share of laughs fist pumping moments when the good guy wins and the situations every guy Australian or otherwise can relate to.<br /><br />See it if you liked: American Pie Almost Famous. Strengths: Good Aussie cast easy to relate to good perve value. Weaknesses: Predictable at points. My Rating: 8 out of 10',pos
'I think every critic who panned Tommy Boy when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all. Every critic panned Chris Farley and David Spades movies. Yes Coneheads was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and Black Sheep I agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made. But Tommy Boy does not fall in the category of Coneheads which could have been a little funnier and Black Sheep which is a piece of tripe. It is very funny and entertaining. I do agree with the critics that Chris Farley was no John Belushi or John Candy as he claimed to have idolized those guys and those guys had a genius for comedy but Chris Farley was very funny and I wish he were around longer to prove to critics that yes he was no John Belushi or John Candy but he was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are side-splitting hilarious and the premise is also laugh out loud hilarious. It is very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like Tommy Boy to remember how truly funny he was. Tommy Boy is one of the 1990s best comedies.',pos
'A repressed housewife (an annoying lisping Angie Dickinson whose body double treats/horrifies us with an extreme closeup of her delicates) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch-out. This directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute (Nancy Allen clearly I am in the wrong business if SHE can bring home $600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you are going to watch De Palma rip off (excuse me pay homage to) Hitchcock watch Sisters instead of this. Dressed to Kill while loaded with style and technical skill is one of the tackiest thrillers I have had the displeasure of sitting through. The plot is absurd and tired. It does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan as long as they can get past the silly story line that must have been dated even in 1980.',neg
'One thing about Hollywood someone has a success and its always rushed to be copied. And another thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home studio.<br /><br />Rock Hudson got such accolades for his performance in the Texas based film Giant that Universal executives must have thought lets quick get him into another modern Texas setting.<br /><br />Similarly Robert Stack got great reviews for The High and the Mighty as the pilot who was cracking under the strain of flying a damaged aircraft that it was natural to give him another crack up role.<br /><br />Both of these ends were achieved in Written on the Wind. Before Hudson was the big ranch owner now hes the son of a hunting companion of Robert Stacks father who took Hudson under his wing. In other words the James Dean part without the James Dean racism from Giant. <br /><br />Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that Stacks Hadley Oil Company uses. Hudson likes her but shes dazzled by Stacks millions and when he woos a girl hes got the means to really pursue a campaign. She marries Stack.<br /><br />And last but not least in the mix we have Dorothy Malone whos Stacks amoral sister who has a yen for Rock but Rock aint about to get tangled up with this wild child. <br /><br />Dorothy Malone spent over 10 years in a whole bunch of colorless film heroine roles before landing this gem. She got a Best Supporting Actress Award for her part as Marilee Hadley and it was well deserved.<br /><br />If you like splashy technicolor Fifties soap opera than this is the film for you.',pos
'Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time and like that earlier film it has little resemblance to Burroughs literary character. But while the 1932 Tarzan was reduced to Tarzan - Jane speech this Tarzan played by Miles OKeeffe doesnt speak or even grunt. He does do the the Tarzan yell a couple of times which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier film.<br /><br />No Tarzan plays second banana to Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather as third banana to Bo Dereks left breast and her right breast. This movie has no point but to show Derek naked.<br /><br />The two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad. More evidence that no one cared.<br /><br />Bizarrely enough Tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film. Maybe he car pooled in from Sumatra with the Indian elephants that are also on display.',neg

'Director and auteur Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old during the spring of 1940 as Frances Third Republic disintegrated in a matter of a few weeks. It was a time he says when all the adults were a little bit insane. He and the production staff have lovingly and meticulously recreated that world in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional. The structure a classic farce is ideal for the period as multiple plot lines zip and intersect only to come together in a logical satisfying conclusion. The peg for this plot is Frederic played by brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere who is fully up to playing opposite Adjani Depardieu and Ledoyen. The real strength of the film is in its supporting performances. M. Rappeneau has cast the film exquisitely with actors who volunteered ideas for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with just two short sentences of dialogue. Though not yet as widely influential as Renoirs Rules of the Game Bon Voyage richly deserves to be a companion piece to that classic. Though it demands a lot of the audience it gives much back. One of its demands is tolerance for a certain coyness and misdirection as to the exact genre we are watching: a crime melodrama no a spy thriller ah a romantic comedy. Recommend it to cinemaphile friends. Just be sure to let them discover for themselves that it is a romantic comedy.',pos

'It must have been several years after it was released so dont know why it was at the movies. But as a kid I enjoyed it. I just found a VHS tape of Superman and the Mole Men at the flea market and decided to watch it again (its been a lot of years). I wasnt expecting much now knowing how the B movies were made at that time. But I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very watchable and the acting by all outstanding. Usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired. Surprisingly the writing wasnt bad either. Forget the fact that Superman went from sequence to sequence and could have kicked all their butts in the beginning because then the story would have ended right?! OK the mole men costumes were hokey and not very scary (they didnt even scare me as a kid). However making allowances for the probable low budget for background and costumes it was a job well done by all. I recognized the sheriff right away as The Old Ranger from Death Valley Days and plenty of supporting roles in TV westerns. J. Farrell MacDonald played old Pop and was always a great supporting actor in more movies than I can count. Walter Reed and Jeff Corey were familiar faces as well from other movies. Did you recognize the old doctor as the captain of the ship that went to get King Kong? Did you recognize the little girl rolling the ball to the mole men as Lisbeth Searcy in Old Yeller? Some of the mole men were famous too. Jerry Maren has played Mayor McCheese for McDonalds Little Oscar Mayer was the Munchkin that handed Dorothy the lollipop was on a Seifeld episode and a wealth of other work. Billy Curtis played an unforgettable part with Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter was one of the friends met by the star in Incredible Shrinking Man he had a part in a movie I just luckily grabbed at a flea market titled My Gal Sal with Rita Hayworth Wizard of Oz and plenty of other parts - great actor. John Brambury was also a Munchkin. Phillis Coates who played Lois Lane in this movie was without question wonderful in the part and George Reeves as Superman/Clark Kent WAS Superman. He did a great job of playing the strong man. Bottom line to all Ive said is that this movie is worth watching because of the cast and writing in dealing with a pretty flimsy idea for a movie. But it was the 50s and anything was possible from intruders from outer space to mole men from inner space. It is definitely worth seeing there isnt a bad actor in the group. Whomever put the cast together was very very fortunate to get so many gifted actors into a B type film. Some already had a wealth of experience and some were about to obtain a wealth of experience - but all were gifted. So if you get a chance to see the film forget the dopey costumes and just enjoy the excitement and acting. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No just a good old fashioned movie to enjoy!',pos
'In Crystal City a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them. When the Navajos cross their path they are invited to visit their hamlet for a dancing party. When the wagon train is near to their destination the Clegg boys threaten the settlers forcing Sandy and Travis to take an attitude.<br /><br />Wagon Master is another great western of John Ford. The sequences with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. The adventure of the group of Mormons is funny and very entertaining and the songs fit well to the plot despite being dated. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Caravana dos Bravos (Caravan of the Braves)',pos

'One of the most charming and for me at least the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghellas enthralling Best Picture-winner The English Patient is that in the mid 90s when Hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects a film was created that brought back tracesvery powerful tracesof the sweeping wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and The Ten Commandments (1956). The English Patient contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all and fascinating characters with pasts and stories.<br /><br />The English Patient based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje is like The Godfather: Part II (1974) in the sense of how its constructed. Its a blending of two stories: the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the post years of World War Two. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient who has been scarred for life by a plane crash and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced troubled patient Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other.<br /><br />Thats just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other one told in flashback is the patients past before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patients past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever.<br /><br />To be blunt The English Patient is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate how obsessive how enchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in love stories such as Minghellas later Cold Mountain (2003) the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love but still because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion we can believe that there is a sure true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of Vertigo (1958) in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other.<br /><br />Performances all around were great. I was especially enthralled by the performance by Juliette Binoche who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe playing the sort of cynical questionable character that hes always quintessential at playing. And of course I cant leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers.<br /><br />Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect film. There are two flaws that I cannot glance over. Number one it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and Im sure it worked perfectly in there but in the film it just seems a littledistracting and the relationship between the two characters didnt fascinate me. I was far more interested by Fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses.<br /><br />Nevertheless these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit. Those put aside The English Patient is an extraordinary achievement of film-making. To me it was sort of like an insane mix up between Casablanca (1942) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962) two remarkable and better films and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time. It is a real shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. For he was a truly gifted filmmaker. This is all the evidence anybody needs.',pos
'Chilly alienating adaptation of Rebecca Wests book about an Army Captain returning from duty in WWII with his memory impaired (now theres an original idea!). It seems he remembers old flame Glenda Jackson but not current wife Julie Christie which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks. This extremely well-cast soaper brings together leading man Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson Christie Ann-Margret and Ian Holm but the burners are all on low. There are a handful of good scenes (particularly whenever Jackson is on-screen) but Bridges pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the films dulled-out color is enervating.

'How does an usual day start in Point Place Wisconsin...<br /><br />First of all Red the tyrannical father of the Forman family and a WWII veteran sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife Kitty serves breakfast. Then comes their skinny son Eric he sits at the table as well and his father starts his daily yelling usually involving placing his foot in Erics behind if (insert reason here). If his promiscuous angel-faced sister Laurie is at home she comes along then Red stops yelling and kindly talks to her making Eric feel left out of the family.<br /><br />Once this daily (painful) ritual is over Eric rushes down to his basement where all his friends are already hanging out. And when we get to see them it becomes obvious Eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend next-door neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti are the sanest people around. Meet Steven Hyde the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and doesnt really care about whats around as long as its not funny to watch; Michael Kelso the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through his life only by his looks and that carrots grow in trees; Jackie Burkhardt the one who thinks of herself as the prettiest girl around spoiled kid of a rich father and of course cheerleader; and Fez a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and cant keep a secret. At first they simply hang out gossiping and making fun of Kelso but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin... before going out doing something theyll regret later.<br /><br />Meanwhile Red goes out and meets Donnas weirdo parents Bob and Midge. Hes rude but they dont mind as they think hes joking. Somewhere around is Leo an aging hippie whos constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing.<br /><br />Did you imagine that seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters? Of course most seem clichéd but the show takes the cliché to a new level. Now throw in some of the most wicked story lines a sitcom can offer sit down and enjoy one of the best TV shows ever.

NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family.

'Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard-earned dollars and lets just say that good old TheatreX took one for the team on this one. Guess what the plots about? Zombies taking over. This time though for the sake of originality (?) this film takes place in Rhode Island and to be honest Im not sure Ive ever seen a zombie flick based in Rhode Island. A TV station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal broadcasts so that any remaining citizens wont think that theres any problem in the world that is those that never look or go outside anyway. I will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film. There is actually somewhat of a story to this but Im not bothering with that because after a while youll either not care or have fallen asleep. At any rate this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the seen it all before stuff that gets trotted out before the camera.

'Fun entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) falling in love with American pilot (Rock Hudson) while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970--I cant see why. Its beautifully shot has wonderful costumes and interiors and exciting aerial dogfights. Also it has Andrews doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--Whistling in the Dark. The movie does have problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shooting of this--and it shows. Their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry. Still they turn in OK performances. The film is a little long (even in the 105 min directors cut I saw) and gets way too dark and serious at the end. Still worth catching. Try seeing the directors cut...the other one runs half an hour longer!',pos

'Just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty couldnt go anywhere we are given a treat a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by Emily Blunt a marvel in the leading role Paul Bettany Rupert Friend Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of Englands most powerful monarchs. The Young Victoria dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power.<br /><br />Emily plays the queen with a good combination of raw strength and innocence someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand but who possesses enough confidence to move forward. She is able to portray Victoria as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand.<br /><br />Victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown and even when she takes command of her new position she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course the right support. Luckily for Victoria there is Albert a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate. There is amazing chemistry between the two performers and theres little doubt what the outcome will be but there is the figure of Bettanys Prime Minister a man who provides Victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her.<br /><br />Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl. Every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by Blunt an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances. In here she is given the breakout role of her career a real life historical figure who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time. She shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years. She also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes.<br /><br />The Young Victoria is not a royal epic portrayal of Englands ruling class. It is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them. In the end the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction. In here there is a message that good writing and good mediation can take us very far and there is of course a good old fashioned love story.',pos
'George Sanders playing the Saint for the penultimate time does a good job out of a good script - with the usual good RKO cast around. Its a non-Charteris story too bristling with murders and good clean fun.<br /><br />Thread 1: In New York Police Inspector Fernack Templars friend is framed in a corruption scandal and disgraced - ST comes over from London to try to put things right. Nice and simple so far - but is there really more than $90000 in the world? Thread 2: Another tale of a woman taking revenge on the people who murdered her brother Wendy Barrie does well in bumping off some nasty men and having the Saint fall in love with her to boot. Including a baddie who was under their direct protection and in Fernacks cellar - theres a creepy shot of him (dead and staring) and them in a car when theyre taking him back to where theyd got him. Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates must have supposed to have been homosexual in this - witness the dressing gown at the beginning and the later beguiling comment by ST that he was thinking of keeping him as a pet - and did too for Palm Springs! Fernack was played by Jonathan Hale as usual but this time with such a beaten deflated attitude that what he really needed was a good slapping from Templar to liven him up.<br /><br />The Hays Office also made sure you got the picture right all threads are tied up with no straggly bits. Well worth watching for all of us who like this kind of thing but if Val Kilmers version is your yardstick then dont bother.',pos
'Based on the 2007 spy novel by David Ignatius Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA operative Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) who is sent to Jordan to track down an Al-Qaeda mastermind all the while treading a narrow tightrope of loyalty to his Jordanian hosts and his manipulative American boss Ed Hoffman (Crowe).<br /><br />Anybody whos seen the trailers could be forgiven for thinking the story revolves around double-agent action and the betrayal of Ferris by Hoffman but the actual story is much more mundane. Instead we are served a tepid broth of ridiculous subterfuge as white pretty boy American Ferris moves with virtual impunity through the teeming streets of Amman Jordan with nary a worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of attention from the locals. Only during a scene where Ferris takes his new-found Iranian sweetheart out for tea does reality intrude as the couple are bombarded with glares from Jordanian men.<br /><br />Compounding the films problems are plot twists and turns which seem designed as nothing more than padding. Ferris flies to Jordan Ferris gets expelled from Jordan Ferris flies to Washington Ferris flies to the UK Ferris flies back to Jordan Hoffman flies to Jordan Hoffman returns home to take care of his kids  an on it goes. This is the sort of stuff you expect to see in an episode of The Amazing Race not a spy thriller.<br /><br />In body-punishing loyalty to his craft Crowe gained an impressive 63 pounds of flab for the role of portly Ed Hoffman thus joining the small select club of actors consisting of Robert De Niro and Christian Bale as thespians whove subjected themselves to massive weight gain or loss for their roles. Its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share Crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.',neg

'Very good Precoder starring Dick Barthelmess which in a way kind of reminded me of Hawks Only Angels Have Wings (1939) in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture Wings.<br /><br />Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess brother appears in scene a triangular relationship ensues.<br /><br />Central Airport has many thrilling moments and some moving and touching scenes too thanks to the great chemistry that develops between Barthelmess and Eilers (who in my opinion in this film resembles very much actress Dorothy Mackaill). Tom Brown is good as Barthelmess brother fresh from his success in Wylers Tom Brown of Culver.<br /><br />Great special effects good flying stunts swiftly paced film; in all highly entertaining. Dont miss it when TCM airs it again.',pos
'Istanbul is another one of those expatriate films that Errol Flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the IRS. Its a remake of the Fred MacMurray- Ava Gardner film Singapore from a decade ago.<br /><br />Unlike that studio product Istanbul has the advantage of that great location cinematography right at the sight of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn who was aging exponentially before the camera in every film was way too old to be playing these action/adventure types any longer. His scenes with Cornell Borchers really do lack conviction.<br /><br />As for Cornell she plays Errols former sweetheart who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has amnesia. She both doesnt remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /><br />But Errols got some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are after some diamonds which have come into his possession. Got to deal with them too.<br /><br />Best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole sing and play the piano. Most people today dont realize that Cole was an accomplished jazz pianist they only think of him as a singer. Actually he was a pianist first the singing was an afterthought.<br /><br />Istanbul is a routine action/adventure film for those who are fans of that type of movie.',neg
'By now youve probably heard a bit about the new Disney dub of Miyazakis classic film Laputa: Castle In The Sky. During late summer of 1998 Disney released Kikis Delivery Service on video which included a preview of the Laputa dub saying it was due out in 1999. Its obviously way past that year now but the dub has been finally completed. And its not Laputa: Castle In The Sky just Castle In The Sky for the dub since Laputa is not such a nice word in Spanish (even though they use the word Laputa many times throughout the dub). Youve also probably heard that world renowned composer Joe Hisaishi who scored the movie originally went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements. Laputa came out before My Neighbor Totoro and after Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind which began Studio Ghibli and its long string of hits. And in my opinion I think its one of Miyazakis best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is a film for all ages and I urge everyone to see it.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Castle in the Skys story it begins right at the start and doesnt stop for the next two hours. The storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted you see Miyazakis true vision. And believe me its one fantastic one. The film begins with Sheeta a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship. Sheeta holds the key to Laputa the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization. The key to Laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many namely the government the military and the air pirate group the Dola gang (who Sheeta and Pazu later befriend). Soon the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid. She falls a few thousand feet but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant. As she floats down from the sky Pazu an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines sees Sheeta and catches her. The two become fast friends but thanks to her pendant the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the Dola gang and government try to capture Sheeta. One action sequence after another we learn all of the characters motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with its fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue. Plus somewhat twisty surprise. I think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time. The story is wonderful as we peak into Hayao Miyazakis animation which has no limits. The setting of the film is a combo of many time periods. It does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons. Laputa is also surprisingly a funny film. The film has tons of hilarious moments almost equal to the drama and action the film holds. I think the funniest part is a fight scene where Pazus boss faces off against a pirate and soon after a riot breaks out. Its funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly.<br /><br />Now lets talk about how the dub rates. An excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life. Teen heartthrob James Van Der Beek plays the hero Pazu who has a much more mature voice then in the Japanese version where in the original he sounded more childlike. Either way I think his voice is a nice fit with Pazu. Anna Paquin the young Oscar winner from The Piano plays Sheeta. This is also a nice performance but the voice is a bit uneven she doesnt stay true to one accent. At times she sounds as American as apple pie but at other times she sounds like someone from New Zealand. The performance I most enjoyed however was of Coris Leachman who played Mama Dola. Not only is this an excellent performance but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life. If there was ever a live action Laputa movie (G-d forbid) she would be the one to play her you can just imagine her in the role (well somewhat). Luke Skywalker himself Mark Hamill is Muska and this is another top rate Hamill performance. You may be familiar with Hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original Star Wars movies but he renders Muska to full evil. His voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the Joker who he played for many episodes on the animated Batman series. Rounding out the cast is voice character actor Jim Cummings who does a great gruff job as the general and Andy Dick and Mandy Patakin as members of the Dola gang.<br /><br />Now let me talk about what really makes this dub special Joe Hisaishis newly arranged music! For those who have never heard of him Mr. Hisaishi does the music and like all of Miyazakis films the music is very memorable. Each of his scores has its own personas which fits the particular film perfectly. Now these new arrangements he has done are more American like which I think was the goal of the new recordings. Dont worry the classic tunes of the Japanese version are still here in great form. The score to me sounds to be arranged like this is a Hollywood blockbuster. It has more power it has more emphasis its clearer and deeper. The films prologue the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships has some new music (I am not sure but I believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all). But a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy. Things seem very enhanced. In a powerful scene the music is more stronger then in the original versions. In a calm scene its more calmer. Overall I think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes I highly did myself and personally think it helps improve the film. I prefer the new score over the old one and I hope Disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack.<br /><br />Another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful and much of the original Japanese lines are intact. In Kiki Im sure a few lines where changed and this is the same way lines have been changed. But a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue Miyazaki has written. I was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered but they were there intact. Some new lines have been added as well which help out. But I am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing Disney DID NOT translate the ending song it was in Japanese. I was mortified when they did completely new songs for the Kiki dub but with this version its the original song... in Japanese. So I guess its good its still the original but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak English.<br /><br />There is a big down side to this dub and it deals with how the voices match the characters lips. Of course in any dub it wont be perfect but I think in Kiki and Mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed (and Disney had a little bit more time with this one...). Some of the time everything matches perfect some of the time it doesnt completley match and in a rare case someone says something and the lips dont move at all (theres a scene where Sheeta chuckles and her mouth doesnt move one bit).<br /><br />As far as things about the film itself these are my thoughts. I thought the most amazing part of Laputa was the animation. From the opening sequence to the ending the animation is so lush and detailed you just have to watch in awe. You see the true nature of each character true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action. You have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film. Everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn its like a moving piece of art. And to think this was done in the mid 1980s. The animation is quite different from Disney Ghibli has its own distinctive flare which is very different but very good. And after all these years the colors look as vibrant as ever. Laputa also has tons of action sequences lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground. These sequences are so well done and so intriguing its scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film. And the finale is just something you MUST see. The sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions guns firing and everything else well. And like all Miyazaki films each one focuses on a different theme (i.g. Kiki: Confidence). This one has a great a lesson on greed and power. People dont realize how greed can take over you and how having too much power isnt good. People are obsessed with power and are greedy and the main villian Muska greatly shows this.<br /><br />All in all Laputa: Castle In The Sky was a great film to begin with and is now improved for the most part. I am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all its glory. With a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from Joe Hisaishi Disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy. Though I think the voices matched the mouths better in the Kiki and Princess Mononoke Disney dubs Castle In The Sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film.',pos

'This movie starts slow then tapers off. After watching for about an hour and seeing absolutely nothing happen I walked out. I mean nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a motion picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same story with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. Its just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching Love In the Time of Money but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to walk out but I waited a bit too long. Instead I watched about 20 people walk out before me.',neg
'Nuri Bilge Ceylans 2002 film Distant (Uzak)- his third feature film (his first was 1997s black and white The Small Town- Kasaba) is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film Clouds Of May (Mayis Sikintisi). The earlier film had potential but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways- plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs. That Clouds Of May succeeded on any level was a testament to Ceylans talent as a budding filmmaker. However Distant is Ceylans arrival on the international scene as a great artist one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (although his screenplay is not as dialogue-heavy it is just as brooding and he lacks Bergmans penchant for close-ups- his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation Ceylan reconfigures). The bulk of the film takes place in snowy hibernal Istanbul (the fact that it snows in Turkey will likely surprise some) which lends the film a definite Bergmanian feel as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from Krzysztof Kieslowskis The Decalogue. The natural images invoke the best of Werner Herzog- as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would dictate- which is what makes them even more memorable while the urban landscapes range from the nearly Precisionist compositions of Michelangelo Antonioni to the cultural hagiography of Woody Allen- one shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quotation (read steal) from Manhattan save the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene Ceylan similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from Ozus Tokyo Story. Yet like all great artists Ceylan makes his appropriations his own art by slightly altering them and keeping them apropos to his own films needs. Distant is a film whose title suffuses the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them but it does not describe the film itself for scenes stay with one long after the film ends. Perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when Mahmut stalks his ex-wife at the Istanbul airport and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever. As he watches her from a distance we see her catch just a glance of him watching her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this film. He pulls back behind a column and Nazan merely turns her head back to her future. Mahmut is her past and she knows how to best move on- just keep moving. Mahmut will never get it. Most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life. That some viewers will get the film and that Ceylan gets his own powers of creation shows that ignorance can teach as long as one moves about it. Distant does albeit it at just the right length.',pos
'This isnt so bad its good--Its so bad it violates the Geneva Conventions prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment! Only by reading the Synopsis can you even figure out the plot of this Straight to Video disaster. Its a hodge-podge of grainy stock footage spliced together with some of the all-time worst acting youll ever have the misfortune to see. Comparing this incompetent turgid humorless mess to Dead Men Dont Wear Plaid is like saying that Gigli is like Citizen Kane. The talentless cast are costumed in cheap J.C. Penney Goin to Church clothes and there isnt the slightest attempt at period hairstyles or make-up. If you really want to see how this sort of homage can work check out The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra--Its clever well-written and best of all performed by actual actors who arent such agony to watch. For that matter seek out the work of Phoenix artist Paul Wilson whose Sci-Fi short The Attack of the 70 foot Courtesy Lady leaves this film in the dust. The people in Terror In the Tropics look and sound like they were pulled off the street and given their scripts to read during the one and only take. This is an insult to Bela Lugosi Boris Karloff Lon Chaney and anyone else involved in the films they cannibalized to make this schlock-fest! Money isnt the problem--A lot can be accomplished with very little expense. A good script decent actors and above Z-Grade costumes and production design should have been a given before the so-called director created this stinky pile of cinematic offal. Lets hope the promise of a sequel doesnt come true--That was by far the scariest thing shown in the whole movie!!',neg
'Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually a lot of people do. And Ill start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and wow....<br /><br />SPOILERS FOR ANG LEES HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK <br /><br />Was it boring! I almost didnt make it through Ang Lees Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless Nick Nolte was horrible Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and thats no fun hes usually a cool character). In fact I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.<br /><br />But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say the CGI was quite good. Thats not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didnt require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. And thats quite a feat.<br /><br />Of course the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banners father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Mans brief heroics to shame. And overall apart from the animated mutant dogs it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected.<br /><br />OK but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... Its boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and heres the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lees version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that didnt even look like a living creature just some sort of computer-generated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting environment and facial effects didnt look 5 years newer than Ang Lees they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director actor or cinematographer ever could.<br /><br />Worse the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lees failure. All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly though both are quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte even though hes only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really doesnt do much in this movie certainly not any more than in Ang Lees version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast-paced but since nothing really happened anyway thats not worth much. Oh yeah the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. Hes actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. <br /><br />This is how I can definitively say Ang Lees version was better: if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lees version again I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely Id just fast forward to the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lees version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle of course).<br /><br />It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lees Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. <br /><br />It is to Edward Nortons credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film.',neg
'This movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone such as The Robe Quo Vadis and Samson and Delilah unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isnt a Jew or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on biblical-related stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned nothing good came from pagan Egypt Greece or Rome.<br /><br />Any movie that preaches about the one true god gives a short shift to freedom of religion. The movies ignore the fact that ancient Judeas lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism. Most 1950s religious movies also overlook the loss of freedom the occurred after Christians assumed political power in the 4th century.',neg
'Stephane Rideau was already a star for his tour de force in Wild Reeds and he is one of Frances biggest indie stars. In this film he plays Cedric a local boy who meets vacationing Mathieu (newcomer Jamie Elkaim in a stunning nuanced ethereal performance) at the beach. Mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother demanding aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). Soon the two are falling in love.<br /><br />The films fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs bits and pieces of the present and real-time forward-movement into the future -- is a little daunting. Director Sebastien Lifshitz doesnt signal which time-period we are in and the story line can be difficult to follow. But stick it out: The films final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you wont be able to take your eyes off the screen. By turns heart-breaking and uplifting this film ranks with Beautiful Thing as must-see cinema.',pos
'I do not like Himesh Reshamiya. I do not like his singing too. But his songs are a craze in India especially among commoners. Now when he ventured to become an actor  that was a big joke! What guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time. I did never want to see this movie. But one thing changed it. The movie becoming a super-duper hit! After 2 weeks Aap Ka Saroor has raked box office collection of 14 crores  compared to Apne that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. If I can sit through Apne and Rajnikants absurd Sivaji  I should give this movie also a try to understand what stuff this movie has got that made it such a big hit? The story is about the real life singer Himesh Reshamiya (HR) who has gone to Germany for a concert and falls in love with Riya (Hansika Motwani). A German lawyer Ruby (Mallika Sherawat) loves Himesh. Now Himesh is arrested for a murder. The mission of Himesh (in last 40 minutes) after he runs away from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murderer.<br /><br />Let me say that Himesh has nothing in him to become a hero. He tries hard but fails miserably. He is pathetic. I was thinking what could have made the movie click so much? Let me find something positive.<br /><br />First the saving grace of the movie is the script till the point Himesh runs away from the jail. (But after that the movie nose dives into unbearable stupid limits) Second the songs of the movie are good catchy crowd puller numbers. Third Mallika Sherawat  she looks gorgeous and acts well too as the second lady. I can imagine fans of Mallika coming to see the movie just for her. Fourth the cinematography of the movie is pleasing  especially the German locales are a treat to watch for the eye. Fifth the major portion of the story is a love story between Himesh and Riya  with clichéd dialogues that would probably connect to young crowd. Sixth the Director Prashant Chadha has done a decent job in covering the pathetic acting skills of Himesh as much as possible with shots that dont need Himesh to act much.<br /><br />The heroine Hansika Motwani looks like a small budget film heroine. Raj Babbar is wasted in a small role. Overall the movie is a below average.<br /><br />I was thinking throughout the movie  what if the same movie script was done with Salmaan as the main lead.

I know that the wanna-be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat so the expectations for this film ran pretty low.<br /><br />Still after sitting through this crap theres one key thing I cant seem to get out of my head:<br /><br />I just sat through an 80s Rob Lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them.<br /><br />The acting is awful the characters boring and flat the portrayal of Oxford an absolute insult and the rowing scenes unexciting uneventful and inaccurate.<br /><br />Unless youve got some wierd Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I guess Rob Lowe) fetish theres really no reason to see this one.',neg
'When I saw this movie I heard all the hype and I heard how people said that Denzel deserved the Oscar alongside his Golden Globe and I believed he must have done an outstanding job considering Kevin Spacey was excellent. I was wrong. I realize that people say this not to anger the African American community (if they are not African Americans themselves). I always hear complaints on how African Americans are never nominated and how they should have won. Sometimes this is true (not as much nowadays) because Whoppi Goldberg should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture. The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was is because people see a movie about the (*SEMI-SPOILER*) hardships of an African American during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is an outstanding actor but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever. I was bored with him in the movie and his acting here was quite similar to his role in Malcolm X but not as good. The audience is supposed to leave believing this man Rubin Carter is a saint. People left the movies worshipping this man this hero and they went out and bought his book making this hero of a man rich.<br /><br />*SPOILERS* This movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit. Of course the crimes he did commit (stealing mostly) was only to survive nothing more. People felt sorry for him even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society. Everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint (except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife) but why wouldnt it-after all it is his point of view. I do not like movies (especially Hollywood interpretations) that are based on true stories because they usually distort the true parts into something else something not so true. This was his point of view and a Hollywood construction yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably. Well I researched his past a bit before making any assumptions and he was a very violent man. Not only that there is still a possibility that he did murder those people. If you do not believe me search for him on the internet and read the articles some people have of him. The boxing match he claimed to have won so easily was actually won by his opponent Joey Giardello and there are tapes to prove it. Besides that there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie. The supporting cast were the nicest people I have ever seen on the face of the Earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up.<br /><br />This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully. Denzels acting is stale and the supporting casts Mickey Mouse attitudes are annoying. The movie also begins very slow paced and is boring.',neg
'So many of these types of movies out these days. This zombie flick falls into the major cheese category unlike the far more polished dawn of the dead and day of the dead. In all fairness those 2 movies were major studio releases with big budgets behind them. But they were also good movies. A low budget movie can still be good if only they would stop accepting and using the worst scripts around. Whoever wrote this movie must have been drunk the whole time.<br /><br />This movie had so so special effects and a very un-even plot line. The one major difference from other movies of its type is the time it takes for people to transform into zombies. In this one it seems to take just seconds for them to die and then turn into a zombie. Yet with the ease this infection spreads you can have zombie blood all over you and not even seem to be at risk for infection and believe me the people in this one get covered in blood.<br /><br />The main problem I had is that our 2 main stars at times were walking around dozens of zombies and didnt get bit. When everybody else turns into zombies amazingly quickly these 2 were swarmed by zombies when they were even unarmed and were able to come out of it without a problem. Our hot chick star even survived a missile strike on the building she was in. I was laughing out load at that point. Unarmed having like 10 zombies on her and a missile hits the building yet she manages to get out without a scratch? OK sure....<br /><br />Also whoever advised these people on how special forces behaves obviously never spent any time in the military. They should have watched a movie like Blackhawk down first to get at least an idea of how they behave in combat situations.<br /><br />One soldier was a fat overweight SPECIAL FORCES private. LOL that was a good one. Another kept going up to zombies thinking they were survivors even putting his weapon down at one point. These guys are in there to fight zombies and they were acting like the soldiers from the movie Stripes. Special Forces lol...<br /><br />Then they get to the point at which they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and the whole thing gets very confusing. The explanation is muddled and does not even follow the first movie. It made no sense at all.<br /><br />The only thing I liked was the Anti Bush jokes. The military lady at the beginning told them that the order came down from the Vice President to the President and at the end it was the Vice President from an undisclosed location giving the orders. That was the best part of the movie for me.',neg

'Sadlythis is not the best British gore film since hellraiser though the DVD cover claims this which is what tricked me into buying it. It is however an homage to many of the great horrors of old films from most notably the Amicus stable.<br /><br />Cradle... is shot on mini dv which though we all know has more of a TV feel than a movie can be done so much better. Every scene set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way (standard key fill rear setup) which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece. The gore content is quite frankly laughable. From the opening shots where we see a mans obviously foam rubber head torn apart through to tacky cheap prop hammers the creature effects and the terrible cg there was nothing in there that impressed me at all.<br /><br />The acting is abominable from the near-comatose detective to the brummie dwarf via Dani Filth the least convincing horror movie bad guy I have ever witnessed. Each of the substories is more formulaic than the last and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs. Look out for the Mental Asylum - a Georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside and the most bizarre (and not in a good way) padded cell I have seen.<br /><br />It took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering (nay running) away at any available opportunity. I actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running.<br /><br />It does however mark one of the last known appearances of Emily Booths breasts which I guess is one (um two) things it has going for it. Once thats out of the way though it is all downhill.<br /><br />Ive heard people say good things about Alex Chandon and I would love to believe them but on this evidence Im not likely to. If you want a decent homage to Amicus avoid this and go for the League of Gentlemen Christmas special instead.<br /><br />Currently battling it out with Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of worst film I have ever seen.',neg
'This was included on the disk Shorts: Volume 2--a rather dull collection of short films. Shorts are among my favorite style of films but somehow the people assembling this second collection had a hard time finding quality content--and it wasnt nearly as good as the first volume or other shorts collections. <br /><br />This short film feels like its woefully incomplete. There is a story but so much in unanswered that the viewer like me feels a bit left out and unfulfilled.<br /><br />The film begins with a woman her boyfriend and her Westie (thats a dog by the way) going to a lonely beach. The lady speaks with an accent that at times is a bit difficult to follow. Given that I am hard of hearing I sure would have loved if it had been closed captioned. Anyway the boyfriend goes for a swim while she naps. When she awakens her dog is gone. She panics and makes the guy follow her all about looking for the dog. They spend most of the time arguing and being disagreeable. Then out of the blue they stop to have sex. Later they find the dog--end of story.<br /><br />As far as the characters go both seemed rather dysfunctional and unlikable. She was a fussy and demanding lady and he seemed to have contempt for her. When you wondered why they were together their little sex break showed what bond kept them together.<br /><br />Some might like the characterizations--I kept finding the people irritating and unreal--more like caricatures than people you might meet or know. Also the payoff for all this just isnt worth the wait (unless you want to see the guy naked).',neg

'Maybe like most others who have seen this film long after its premiere on television I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form which is exactly what Slow Burn is. Except aside from the nostalgic value the movie itself is not very good.<br /><br />Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash hired by a Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry) a rich artist to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son Brian who had been living with his mother Laine (Beverly DAngelo) for the past few years. In a Phillip Marlowe-esquire fashion Jacob Ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of Brian. But once Jacob tracks down Laine his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble. Perhaps because events in the film move too slowly there is never much suspense to this little thriller not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives.<br /><br />However as said before this movie is probably one that will draw attention for its then-relatively unknown cast of actors which include both a very young Eric Roberts as well as the adorable Johnny Depp who plays Laines stepson Donnie. That may be reason enough to give it a try...if you can find it.',neg
'This film is dreadful. It has absolutely zero laughs. Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) sets out to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise. While there are some (far and few) nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent it is laboured hackneyed and ultimately mindlessly boring. This despite the fact that Goldberg Dick and Greer (Hammers client/love interest) all have quite considerable screen presence. Despite being played for what might be described as whacky over-the-top gags this film is consistently middle-class middle-of-the-road muck. DO NOT waste 85 minutes of your life on this.

'This series is formulaic and boring. The episodes are the same thing every week simply with slightly varied settings. Some purely evil character does some dastardly deed Walker goes after him and it ends in a Karate match. The villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains the good guys are all pure honest and saintly and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. After about 2 episodes the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. Certainly not Norriss best work. His other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks. If you enjoy formulaicboring repetitive clichéd snooze-fests then this is for you.',neg
'Then you must see this film to understand the reality. Having read the book Ms. Duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with bipolar disorder; formerly labeled manic-depression.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that in this day and age people still critique others with emotional problems or those who seek psychiatric help. Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists and this is unfortunate.<br /><br />In this film the audience sees the pain and suffering Ms. Duke had been through especially as a child. Many of us may remember her from the teenage Patty Duke Show. She was a household name in America by age 15.<br /><br />You learn of her exploitation by the Ross(well played by Howard Hesseman). As she was growing up in the 1950s the stigma was in full-force. However we see as she advances in her career yet the illness becomes worse. She goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity; even marries someone whom she divorces the next week; and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother. All these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy and medication.<br /><br />A recent survey released by NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) recorded that a majority of US adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder. It also was released that one in five respondents to the poll believed that people could CONTROL their illness without medication if they wanted to. (bp Magazine Winter 2006) If you watch this film you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not pull herself up by her bootstraps and get well until she was educated about her disorder and received proper treatment. Thank you Ms. Duke for being an advocate against ignorance and prejudice.',pos
'Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) an exchange student in Japan who is just beginning to do some social work is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman Emma (Grace Zabriskie) after her previous caretaker Yoko (Yoko Maki) disappears. Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emmas home and she attempts to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.<br /><br />Maybe its a delayed influence from the success of M. Night Shyamalans films but slower-paced understated horror films are a recent trend. In some cases such as Hide and Seek (2005) the approach works remarkably well and in others such as White Noise (2005) the pacing tends to kill the film. I didnt like The Grudge quite as much as Hide and Seek but this is still a very good film--it earns a 9 out of 10 from me.<br /><br />The Grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend however. One it is well known that this is a remake based on the Japanese film series that began with Ju-On (2000) (in particular its extremely close to the first half of Ju-On: The Grudge aka Ju-On 3 from 2003). Two as with many Japanese horror films the slower pacing here isnt so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism. As is also the case with a large percentage of European horror The Grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare.<br /><br />Director Takashi Shimizu also the director of the five Japanese entries in the Ju-On series to date (the fifth is currently in production) and writer Stephen Susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story. The idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes with dream logic where the focus is atmosphere creepiness the uncanny and for many viewers--scares. How well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to or are used to this different approach to film-making (although admittedly some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the Ju-On series). Traditionally American audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning rules for the monster. A more poetic metaphorical surreal approach to film isnt yet accepted by the mainstream in the U.S.<br /><br />However even if youre not used to it its worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give The Grudge a shot. This is a well written well directed well acted film filled with unusual properties such as the story interweaving a large number of main characters (which is done better here than the more episodic Ju-On 3) good cinematography subtle production design touches (check out Gellars clothes which match the color and texture of the exterior of Emmas house when Gellar first approaches) and beautifully effective horror material.<br /><br />Even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past the pacing usually enhances the eeriness and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained. The supernatural premise of the film is absorbing and based on interviews on the DVD with Shimizu have prodded me to pay more attention to Japanese beliefs and folklore. Although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture its interesting to ponder why so many Japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children.<br /><br />I subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery/thriller territory with a heres what really happened flashback but even that was fairly well done and otherwise this would have been a 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Now that Ive said all of the above let me finish with a mini-rant: Its not that Im anti-remake but it is ridiculous that U.S. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption. The original versions of these films should just be playing in U.S. theaters in wide release. There is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white American actors for non-white or foreign actors. Yes The Grudge is a fine film but ultimately Id rather see something original using this talent and be treated to the latest foreign horror films--not just Japanese but also Indian Spanish Chinese etc.--at my multiplex. In the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this it is also more cost-effective to do this as (1) you can completely avoid production costs and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit and (2) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film DVDs in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions.',pos
'I had high expectations of this movie (the title translated is How We Get Rid of the Others). After all the concept is great: a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the right-wing governments constant verbal and legislative persecution of so-called freeloaders and the left wing in general and decided to just kill off everyone who cannot prove that theyre contributing something to the establishment (the establishment being called the common good but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology).<br /><br />Very cool idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only this movie completely blows its chance. The satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity but this satire is not sustained; it is neither sharp nor witty. And for an alleged comedy the movie has nearly no funny scenes. The comedy I assume is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over-serious rather than evoking either laughter or thought.<br /><br />The script is rife with grave errors in disposition. The action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing but instead oodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun and whos trying to save everybody by organizing a resistance that ships people to Africa. All this is beside the point! A movie like this should not pretend to be so serious! Its a satire! A political statement. But it doesnt even begin to actually address the problem its supposed to be about. Maybe it was afraid of going too far? How cowardly. Thats not art. Its not even real satire.<br /><br />Søren Pilmark a very serious and by now one of Denmarks absolutely senior actors was very good. He largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had. Everybody else: nothing special (well perhaps except for Lene Poulsen who did supply a convincing performance).<br /><br />In fact a problem with most Danish movies is that the language never sounds natural. Neither the formulation nor the delivery. Why is it so difficult to make it sound right? Why must it be so stilted and artificial? I hope when people look at these movies fifty years from now they dont think that this was how people talked in general Danish society.<br /><br />3 out of 10.',neg
'I felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined IMDb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a while.<br /><br />The acting/direction/other-areas of the movie are fantastic. I love brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The witty banter was still there too from the first movie. My question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? I thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth. I have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life. Here i was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry good acting good direction amazing plot) only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it.<br /><br />The part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars.<br /><br />In summary I felt that this movie insulted my intelligence. I still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.',neg
'I havent seen Henry Fool but after watching Fay Grim Im not sure I want to. Maybe Hartley aims to be the anti-thriller director---he sure succeeded with this yawner. Based on the official description---woman discovers that her dead husbands manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security---I expected a taut geopolitical drama. Instead I got flimsy structure goofy dialog flabby characterizations a convoluted plot and a tone that shifts so often it suggests that Hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time. I can hang for a long time with a frustrating hard-to-follow plot (e.g. Duplicity) because I figure that the loose ends eventually will come together. Even when they dont or they do but they leave lingering questions (e.g. Duplicity) sharp writing and acting can hold ones interest. But half-way through Fay Grim I reached a deadly realization---I didnt know what was going on and I didnt care. Too bad because I really like Parker Posey reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent estranged wife and indifferent clueless mother to tough shrewd international player capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists. Theres also bad casting. Jeff Goldblum can be very good but hes not capable of overcoming miscasting as a CIA operative. He looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as I was watching him in it. His CIA sidekick is worse; he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of American Idol (are there really young CIA agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads?). Then theres the sticky question of the characters ages. Goldblum was 54 when he made Fay Grim; Thomas Jay Ryan who plays Henry Fool was 44. Neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages. Yet a key point in the story is that they served as CIA agents in Nicaragua back in the 70s. Goldblums character wouldve been in his 20s then; Henry Fool wouldve been a teenager. Was Hartley being quirky or lazy? The problems are too numerous to list...',neg

'Greta Garbo stars in Anna Christie a very early 1930 MGM talkie the first time Garbo Talks. Anna Christie is a powerful movie but not for everyone. The movie is filmed like a stage play short on sets and cinematography long on dialogue and dramatic characterizations. Eugene ONeil who wrote the play Anna Christie is known for his dark work and Garbos character Anna Christie is a bleak figure with a tortured past.<br /><br />The sound quality on the DVD was mediocre. Not helping matters is that George F. Marion who plays Annas estranged dad Chris Christofferson is verbally hard to understand. Marion gives a good performance as the old drunken seamen who’s teetering on insanity with his fixation of the evil devil sea. But his dialogue is written with a very heavy Swedish accent this is true to ONeils original play. Marie Dresslers dialogue as Marthy Owens is equally hard to understand. Dressler believably portrays a broken down old drunken women a wharf rat. Her dialogue also is true to ONeils original play as is Charles Bickford as the Irish seamen Matt Burke who pursues Anna in a troubled relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand.<br /><br />The films strong point is Greta Garbo. She delivers a gut wrenching performance as the victim of neglect and abuse leading to a life of prostitution. Garbo was a huge star at the time and considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Here her look isnt glamorous its tortured. Her body posture nearly doubles over in agony. She scrunches her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. Garbo conveys these angst-ridden feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery.<br /><br />This is dark subject matter and Garbo brings it to life. It’s not light fare not fun not for everyone. ‘Anna Christie’ is strong emotions dredged up from the depths for examination this is one helluva ride.',pos

Well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through. The actors played there roles perfect especially Mark Wahlberg John C. Reilly and William H. Macy. The sex scenes of course are terrific but mainly focus on the characters hype in porn films until there struggles. Excellent film one of the best! <br /><br />Hedeens Outlook: 10/10 **** A+',pos
'This was a flick doomed from its conception. The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie. I wasnt the least bit interested. Then came the trailer. Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and Im not exaggerating - every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer. Its like a 3-minute Cliffs Notes version of the flick. So obviously I wasnt gonna pay to see it but once it hit DVD I thought sure Ill watch it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save it.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />Im still baffled as to why he signed on for this. He must have owed someone a favor. The jokes were all so flat and obvious and the director obviously asked him to go for very broad comedy style like the original Bruce Almightys Jim Carrey. But its just not funny. The studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40-Year-Old Virgin complete with several of Carells past co-stars a reference to the flick on a theater marquee and another musical closing credits sequence. But even the talented Carrell cant save this. His co-stars dont fare much better with people like Morgan Freeman Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just wasted. Wanda Sykes isnt wasted shes just a waste in anything she does and her horrible one-liners and reactions just make you wish people would stop giving her work.<br /><br />The story itself is just predictable and lazy. It pounds you over the head with obvious foreshadowing like Evans disregard for the environment (drives a gas-guzzling Humvee opts to use wood from endangered trees for his house hates animals...) and by the end its just over-the-top preachy on both faith and the environment.<br /><br />Why the movie was made at all is puzzling enough but I really dont understand how it reportedly became the most expensive comedy ever. The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work Ive ever seen. Maybe the rental of the live animals on set cost a fortune. Who knows. But whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure. But hey it wasnt the worst film of the year by far. Theres still plenty of worse duds like Norbit and Death Proof.',neg

It doesnt try to teach you anything it shows you how life works in nature.<br /><br />I wont talk about the quality of the pictures because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched.<br /><br />Earth is funny tense and sad. It can make you laugh it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first movie that made me cry not because you feel sorry for the animals but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with yet we dont appreciate it one bit.<br /><br />This movie should be shown obligatory in schools. It is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it. Who knows maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this...<br /><br />10/10 but I would easily rate it more if it were possible.',pos

'I often wonder why this series was slammed so much. I thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and performed. I think in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves that is if they ever issue it. Many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and all went on to greater things. Maybe this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued. Sally Phillips Simon Pegg Peter Serafinowicz and not least Julian Rhind-Tutt of the hugely successful Green Wing. The writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the finest comedy writers of the modern age. Anyone that can produce comedy like Father Ted couldnt be capable of writing something not worthy of publication. If it is ever issued I will certainly buy it.',pos
'Jackie Chans classic directorial feature POLICE STORY (1985) is among the most influential and over-the-top modern day police actioners ever to come out from Hong Kong. Jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other urban action which would later become very popular and typical among HK directors like John Woo and Ringo Lam. POLICE STORY mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds.<br /><br />Jackie plays Chan Ka-Kui a police who gets to protect an important witness (Brigitte Lin) who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity. Jackies girlfriend is played by young and sweet Maggie Cheung who isnt as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like Heroic Trio (and the sequel) by Johnnie To Savior of the Soul by Corey Yuen and David Lai and many many others. The plot in POLICE STORY is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place.<br /><br />Jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which Jackie hits his head (near the eye) through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass. Also Jackies stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film. The scene in which a bus stops right before Jackie spitting the kidnappers through the windshield went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didnt fly as they were supposed to. They were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries. During the end credits there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely.<br /><br />The action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by (action) director Chan. The now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver. Jackie always tells how important editing is (which is true) and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to Hollywood efforts for instance. Theres hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch.<br /><br />But there is again one negative point which I cannot stand in HK action comedies which is this comedy itself. The comedy isnt funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay arent there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue. I mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare and he is there to murder that girl. This kind of acting is stupid and inept and I wouldnt like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre. Characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those loud thoughts are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and light. Even if the film is comic and not so serious these kind of stupidities should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily.<br /><br />POLICE STORY is a fast speed full impact balls to the walls action adventure miracle from Hong Kong and from the time when Jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the US produced The Protector as he didnt have the same thoughts about the film as director James Glickenhaus had and thus the result didnt please audiences and Jackie and he returned to Hong Kong to make more personal and inventive film. That he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80s. This is among the most insane action films ever and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws I mentioned. 7/10',pos
'-love is hard to find in this fast food society that we live in so man called Hitch makes it duty to help men find love with women that they are beyond madly in love with. his rules are that he only helps you find love and not just some casual sex which seems like a great deal but soon word begins to spread around and people begin to get the wrong idea about what he does which begins to complicate the relationship with woman he just met that he is madly in love with.<br /><br />-I have to say its really nice to see Will Smith in a movie that doesnt have him trying to save the world from aliens or robots. There are no jaw dropping effects nor is he showing off his beefed up body. Hes just a normal human being in this movie which was really nice. He doesnt necessarily stretch his acting muscles in this movie but then again the story doesnt call for that but all the same it was nice to see him relaxed and not showing off his ripped body to make those of us without six packs jealous. His character here is as with all his characters likable witty and very charming which is something that almost all the characters in this odd love tale seem to share. The Kevin James character is just a regular guy that needs help hooking up with the girl of his dreams which really makes you feel for the guy and root for him every step of the way. the only character that was a sore spot for me was the Mendez character because shes so cold and calculated that its hard to believe that Smith could fall for her. He must love a challenge I guess.<br /><br />-now this is the part of the review in which Ill make a joke about how I would never need Hitch because Im such a player but I just got through writing about 16 reviews for another web site plus Im still working on a little project so Im a little jaded right now. whiles the movie is packed with enough charm and likable characters with funny lines it slowly but surely falls into the sea of formulaic romantic movies in which after the big scene where the terrible secret comes out everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before. But hey theres like 4000 movies about the underdog overcoming adversity so I guess one more movie having a predictable ending thats been done to almost death doesnt cause much harm. I really like the message of the movie as well because in the end you dont need a formula to get the right girl just be yourself and all will fall into play which is theme of the movie and why it works so well. Im sure if it had turned out that the James character gets the girl after following everything that the Smith character said then it would have being a pretty empty movie but as it stands it works really well.<br /><br />-despite being predictable this is a PERFECT date movie. Its sweet its funny and its romantic so anyone that watches this movie on a date should be getting some after its over. and by some I mean sex',pos
'This is a great movie if viewed in the proper context - It was meant to be a parody of teen-horror-devil-worship movies (and the 80s saw plenty of them)! I saw this movie when it first came out and instantly liked it. Being a big fan of KISS it was great to see Gene in the movie. And anything with OZZY as a metal-hating preacher cant be all bad! Also Fastway was already a favorite of mine so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack.<br /><br />The original VHS (this was pre-DVD) cover for Trick Or Treat featured an illustration of Sammi kneeling playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a demon looking on. It was a special order and the price for the VHS copy at the time (circa 1987) was $90! I really wanted the movie but not at that ridiculous price. The OZZY-Gene cover was only created for the $5 re-release. The company releasing it probably figured Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the movie so they had better put em on the cover! Same thing with the original Little Shop Of Horrors - Jack Nicholson was in it for all of five minutes but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star.<br /><br />I have a Trick Or Treat web site and its surprising how many people believe Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to Sammi Curr.<br /><br />All-in-all it was just a good time rock-n-roll movie. Definitely not to be taken too seriously but just enjoyed!',pos
'There is nothing like an Oscar Wilde comedy and this movie is nothing like a comedy. The melodrama labors from scene to scene and the comedy is completely absent. In the original story the humor comes from the Americans who are oblivious to the ghostly traditions of Canterville Chase. The American father even offers some oil to the ghost to quiet the creaking chains. Read the book!',neg
'This is actually a very good surreal mystery movie despite the description that tries to sell it as a Sci-Fi movie. Balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together. She spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions. Very atmospheric and effective. It is true that Kinski does not appear very much in this film but the staring actors are very good. There is only an English dubbed version available in the US and the dubbing leaves something to be desired but the actors do a very good job. The cinematography by Academy Award winner Vittorio Storaro is excellent. An earlier Giallo by director Bazzoni THE FIFTH CORD is also excellent and also lensed by Storarro.',pos

Embarrassing situations are funny; first time i see this series i was in the video store people around me started laughing doesnt matter the age or gender. A teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending shouldnt be obvious by just reading the last page. During the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car during the last moments of the series the same car appears.. Episodes had a touching and funny ending specially last one.

'I understand wanting to make a movie that is edgy and different. I understand the previous reviewer comments that this is a miss-understood movie. My point is as soon as this movie ended my first comment was:  this is what happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent.....she uses daddys money to make a movie she wrote directs and pays for.....obviously to close to the movie to realize there was no character development and no directions such as a beginning middle and ending.....the voyeur part was good and edgy but what was the point? I saw a women go to a house find some pictures screw the caretaker come out side on a very cold night (not believable) to check on noise and runs over her caretaker lover....movie ends......some one educate my ignorant arss?? I really want to know what the point is....what was the directors vision.....why no development of the dead lover? Why no background on the caretaker? What is the point of the night vision? What is the point of the lipstick on the car? Why a dead caretaker? Why tell us about an escaped mental patient/peeping tom? Whats with the urn? Oh and the lamp is that suppose to signify whose house this is? Territorial? Why? Why would the caretaker feel like its his house? that aspect was never pursued......as for William Defoe...I rented this movie because he was in it and known for edgy characters.....write back and do tell me what I need to learn....I am just a mom in middle America who loves movies....Chris....',neg
'Everything that you need to know about the pornography of the late 70s and early 80s is all wrapped up in Paul Thomas Andersons BOOGIE NIGHTS. Although the film is completely fictional it is actually supposedly based on the story of porno kingpin John Holmes.<br /><br />In Southern California in 1977 Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) is working as a busboy in a nightclub. One of the regular customers is pornographer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and two of his starlets Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack and Eddie meet and Jack realizes that Eddie is well...a little...gifted.<br /><br />So Eddie stars in Jacks films under the pseudonym of Dirk Diggler. He becomes a big porno star (no pun intended) and seems to be on top of everything. Then comes the 80s when video replaces film and Jacks porno empire begins to collapse along with Dirk Diggler and everybody else working in the field.<br /><br />BOOGIE NIGHTS is a really well-filmed drama. There is a little bit of violence but P.T. Anderson makes it more stylized. And it kind of is a scathing approach to the degradations of pornography especially when VHS became the standard medium for making pornos.<br /><br />A lot of bizarre and unique characters are introduced. William H. Macy has an interesting role as someone working on the films whose wife keeps having sex with everybody. I especially liked Don Cheadles role as Buck the stereo salesman. The best performance is BOOGIE NIGHTS was definitely Burt Reynolds. A 90s classic!',pos
'This is one of the very very few films that are so overwhelming that you are very unlikely to watch it more than once or twice in your lifetime (other examples are Claude Lanzmanns documentary Shoah and Come and See by the directors husband Elem Klimov - which covers much the same unbearable territory but in a very different way).<br /><br />I suppose this is just as well given the difficulty of ever seeing a print.<br /><br />Apparently its extraordinarily overt Christian symbolism and admission that there were active Russian collaborators ensured that it was hardly ever seen in the USSR - and of course post-soviet Russia has very little interest in films of that era.<br /><br />The one time I saw it in London was in a festival of Russian movies shown during the Glasnost era (i.e. probably c.1988) - however it apparently has been shown several times in the UK more recently so at least one subtitled print must exist here.<br /><br />As far as I know it has never been released in the west on DVD or video so if you havent seen it your best chance is probably to join a film society and endlessly nag them to find a print and screen it.',pos
'When I saw this documentary I was disappointed to see Serbian Propaganda in action once again. Even though Serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of Yugoslavian breakup it is not mentioned in this documentary which is made by Bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective. It is one in the set of lies pushed by Milosevic regime. Everyone else is guilty only Serbians were right and victims even though most of the War Criminals tried in Hague are Serbs even though Serbs are one who have committed genocide against Bosnians  and attacked Slovenia Croatiaand Bosnia all independent nations recognized by the UN.Breakup of Yugoslavia was not avoidable because Serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on Federal Yugoslav government so SLovenia Croatia Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests.If you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of Yugoslavia and fact led documentary this is not it . You should watch Yugoslavia:Death of a Nation Made by Discovery channel and BBC.',neg
'Superhero Movie (2008) is the most recent in the long line over parody movie movies which I despise so much. I wish this movie could be the death of the genre but I know that it isnt awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin.<br /><br />If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as Hollywood movies go than Superhero Movie is probably near the top. Unfortunately Meet the Spartans was actually miles below the barrel and this movie just barely makes it in.<br /><br />Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebs. Its got Drake Bell (the kid from Disneys Drake and Josh) Leslie Nielson (Airplane!) Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock) and a few others scattered throughout. Although it has the star power to light a 40-watt bulb the movie fails to utilize any humor.<br /><br />This movie is about 80 minutes long most of which is dedicated to following the Spiderman plot and not one single joke is funny. I didnt laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire time.<br /><br />Dont see this movie. Dont even think about it. For the love of cinema just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another one.<br /><br />...oh who am I kidding? Theyll probably come out with another one by fall.',neg
'One of my favorite movies. Great cast lead by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with brilliant comedic punches. An exact mixture of character and story. Real people with real problems and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Sensitively moves from slightly-sad to hilariously-funny. Read the quotes. This is the best adaptation of a Neil Simon play.<br /><br />If you wanna see more of Eugene check Biloxi Blues (starring Matthew Broderick who played in both stage versions) is OK a bit on a darker side. Get away from the made-for-TV Broadway Bound.',pos

'Twisted bizarre enchanting and hilarious! I couldnt stop laughing watching this film. Darren Stein presents the movies he made on the family camcorder growing up in Southern California in the 1980s. Its an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate for the camera. Manipulation is a strong word however dont we all watch movies to be manipulated in some way or another? <br /><br />From the beginning I was amused at the fact that the boys in the films seemed to appear shirtless whenever possible. Later Darren comments about his budding homosexuality and you can see it from the hints (big hints!) of flamboyance at an early age. Maybe it was just the warm Southern California weather who knows? As a gay man who also grew up in a nurturing environment its great to see that his parents supported and loved him and that his friends seemed to be entranced with his nascent talent behind the lens.<br /><br />Put the Camera On Me offers a look back to the 80s untouched by commercialism. Youll remember the hair the music and the fashions. Im the same age as Mr. Stein so the trip back to memory lane was welcome. His solo lip-syncing dance number is priceless enhanced by the Frankie Goes To Hollywood t-shirt.<br /><br />The films deal with dark themes at time. Child abuse the Holocaust nuclear war sexual fantasy and social dysfunction. No childhood is completely carefree and the way Stein deals with these subjects is interesting to say the least and hilarious to behold.<br /><br />Watch at your earliest convenience!',pos
'This is the most stupid movie ever made. The story is laughable. His wife and kid think hes insane. Then they dont. Then it turns out he is and I think they knew it all along. There is a dog named Ned that causes some problems and I think its all his fault...so does Jim Carey. God only knows why Virginia Madsen took this role...this is a career sinker. I think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 year olds. And that adds up to 23. Or maybe its for 8 and 10 years olds which also adds up to 23. Or maybe its for really dumb 23 year olds. Or maybe really dumb 32 year olds because thats 23 in reverse. Or maybe 46 year olds would enjoy it because half of that is 23. I think looking up things on the internet about the number 23 would be more entertaining than this movie unless you wanted to see a comedy.',neg
'Richard Chamberlain is David Burton a tax lawyer living in Sydney Australia who is drawn into a murder trial defending five Aboriginal men accused of murdering a fellow native in Peter Weirs apocalyptic 1977 thriller The Last Wave. Taking up where Picnic at Hanging Rock left off the film goes deeper into exploring the unknown and in the process shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions. Weir shows how white society considers the native beliefs to be primitive superstitions and believes that since they are living in the cities and have been domesticated their tribal laws and culture no longer apply. <br /><br />From the start Burton is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and dream time evaporates. Water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to Burtons discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps. As violent and unusual weather continue with episodes of black rain and mud falling from the sky the contrast between the facile scientific explanations of the phenomenon and the intuitive understanding of the natives is made clear. Burton and his wife Annie (Olivia Hamnet) study books about the Aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in the tribal traditions. When he invites one of his clients Chris Lee (David Gulpilil) to his home for dinner he is disturbed to find that he is the subject of an inquiry by Chris and his friend Charlie (Nadjiwarra Amagula) an enigmatic Aborigine sorcerer involved with the defendants. As Burtons investigation continues his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murder.<br /><br />After Chris starts to appear in his dreams Burton is convinced that the Aborigine was killed in a tribal ritual because he saw too much though Chris refuses to acknowledge this in court. Burton becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he cannot unravel says to his stepfather priest Why didnt you tell me there were mysteries? This is a legitimate question but according to the reverend the Church answers all mysteries. Burton knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves. Though we do not know for certain what is real and what is a dream he comes face to face with his deepest fears in a haunting climax that will leave you pondering its meaning into the wee hours of the morning.<br /><br />In this period of history in which native Hopi and Mayan prophecies predict the end of history and the purification of man leading to the Fifth World The Last Wave though 25 years old is still timely. The Aborigines are portrayed as a vibrant culture not one completely subjugated by the white man yet I am troubled by the gnawing feeling that we are looking in but not quite seeing. Weir has opened our eyes to the mystery that lies beyond our consensual view of reality but he perpetuates the doom-orientation that sees possibility only in terms of fear showing nature as a dark and uncontrollable power without a hint of the spiritual beauty that lives on both sides of time.',pos

Then hes scared that someones going to barbecue his bull so he kidnaps it and heads home with it. I was really excited when I first saw this film in the theater and was surprised to see George Strait Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little film.

After that everything change a child was born and all the rest usually happen in a couple. It is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple and normality is the center of this movie. It doesnt want to show us something particular there is nothing new it is just a normal love-story the story of a couple and being normal it become different from the rest. It is also a flashing movie everything is short every scene is long just some seconds. It is a reported story many things are known because friends and parents talk about that and their opinion is central the opinions create the story and destroy it. It is a simple story of a couple as I said but it is not boring it just show a couple should be everything known it is but I am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen so dont forget to watch the end!',pos

'Being a fan of the series I thought how bad can the movie be? Well I got my answer. Some movies should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters. The Pete character in the series wasnt a whiney little baby as portrayed in the movie. The only good thing in this movie besides the music and that Clare Danes is pretty was that it was short. Whats with that dance scene??? The only reason I didnt walk out of this film was because it was so bad it got funny. Maybe that was the plan! Its really bad when a cheap 60s TV show is better then a 90s 20 million dollar film. El Mariachi cost only $7000 and is a much better film. Dont even waste your money when it comes out on tape its not even worth renting.',neg
'You Belong To Me was the final teaming of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for Fonda to Columbia Pictures. Fonda had signed a contract with 20th Century Fox in order to get the Tom Joad part in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at Fox.<br /><br />But the rule was broken here. Though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to Charles Pike from The Lady Eve this film isnt anywhere near as funny. In fact feminists would probably be aghast at it. <br /><br />In fact Barbara Stanwyck herself didnt like it at all. She liked working with Henry Fonda right enough but thought this film was ridiculous. As well she should have.<br /><br />Fonda is another millionaire playboy who we would now call a trust fund baby who doesnt really do much with his life. Hes sort of lovable lunkhead who meets Stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls for her trying to show off. Turns out shes a doctor and they have a whirlwind courtship and get married. <br /><br />But it turns out Fonda has a jealous streak especially when it involves Roger Clark another millionaire patient of Stanwycks. And hes not understanding as to her professional obligations.<br /><br />Stanwyck like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn was and is a feminist icon. When she tells Fonda that he ought to go out in the working world and live on a salary and see if he can do it Fonda goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store. Shes so proud of him that she actually is going to give up her medical practice and live with him on his salesmans salary.<br /><br />Today NOW would be picketing the film. Stanwyck did not have too much conviction in her performance probably because she didnt believe any of it. I certainly couldnt. <br /><br />I dont think even back then audiences believed it either. But the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best but this one was a Thanksgiving special.',neg
'<br /><br />If youre at all interested in pirates pirate movies New Orleans/early 19th century American history or Yul Brynner see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it. Dont be put off by various lacklustre reviews. My reaction to it was that it is entertaining well acted (for the most part) has some very witty dialogue and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer Jean Lafitte. While not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?) I feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role Lafitte played in New Orleans history and the love-hate relationship between the respectable citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the citys favorite sons. Dont worry about what the film doesnt do but watch it for what it does do i.e. for its study of one of New Orleans and Americas most intriguing historical figures.',pos
'Wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan but what happens when the mustachioed Latin son falls for a certain Crawford with bright eyes blonde hair and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. It is very heavy on the frenetic gymnastic-like dancing exceedingly thin on story. Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives it a boost even though shes paired with leaden Don Ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair). Also good: Charlotte Greenwood as Bettys pithy aunt a limousine driver whos constantly asleep on the job and Carmen Miranda playing herself (who else?). The stock shots of Argentina far outclass the action filmed on the Fox backlot and some of the supporting performances are quite awful. By the time of the big horserace finale most viewers will have had enough. *1/2 from ****',neg
'Claire Deniss movies seem to fall into one of two categories: the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate. LIntrus definitely falls into the first category but its not so awful as Trouble Every Day or Jai pas sommeil.<br /><br />Now ever since I saw Chocolat Ive made it a point to see every new movie Denis makes. And I have always been disappointed. LIntrus was no exception. She has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one. <br /><br />You get a lot of the Denis regulars: an older but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips the gap between her teeth her ample cleavage and a couple of nice coats; the black guy from Trouble Every Day and Jai pas sommeil Grégoire Colin and that Lithuanian or Russian girl. Michel Subors character was interesting enough but the camera lingered on him at such length that I got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when somewhere in Korea I think he finally got it cut. <br /><br />There was certainly some action--gruesome murders a mans search for a son--and there may even have been a plot but one viewing wasnt enough to figure it out and two viewings are I fear out of the question. For one thing the score was jarring and obtrusive (as in Beau Travail). For another the seasons changed too abruptly leaving you even more confused about what was going on. Oh there were a few pretty shots and if you liked Friday Evening with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets you might appreciate the aesthetics of LIntrus. Otherwise steer clear. <br /><br />I saw this movie in French and its possible I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages double spaced and with ample margins. In Chocolat the silence is sublime; in LIntrus its just dull.',neg
'Okay so the previews to this film only tells you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to straighten out. That is actually not the case! Its about a young rebellious 17 year old girl who reveals a secret and its up to her mother to believe if shes telling the truth or not.<br /><br />To be honest I really enjoyed the concept of this movie. They had a really good plot and a really good theme of a love/hate relationship between mother and daughter. I did not however enjoyed watching Lindsay Lohans acting. In reality this movie would have been GREAT if they had someone else perhaps a better actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and it sort of reminds us of the real Lindsay so it takes away a lot from the film.<br /><br />I do however think that if you put Lindsay aside you will enjoy this film. The ending is pretty great (and sad).',neg
'Im shocked that there were people who liked this movie..I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny. I felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience but honestly the plot to this movie needed MAJOR revision..it didnt even make sense one second the characters question what exactly it is that theyre snorting..the next scene theyre hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it?? Also the ending just took the cake..Im not going to spoil the magnificent conclusion..but it pretty much blended right in with the rest of the horrible plot/script...see this movie for comedy if you must..',neg
'Heartland was in production about the same time as Michael Ciminos Heavens Gate - Heartland cost a fraction to make but is 10 times the piece of film.<br /><br />Heavens Gate was the biggest and most expensive ($40 mil in 1980!) Hollywood flops of all time its failure resulted in the sale of the United Artists studio to MGM -imdb entry <br /><br />Heartland cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing direction photography and acting. It easily draws you into the beauty joys hardships and sorrow of pioneer life.<br /><br />Its sad that Hollywood sometimes would pour millions into turkeys (based on a directors single big hit) and neglect such a wonderful story.',pos
'The Waiting Womans Ward of a large lying-in hospital with all its joys and sorrows is the place where LIFE BEGINS.<br /><br />This nearly forgotten drama is a fine little soap opera replete with comedy and tragedy all tied into the lives of the maternity staff and their patients. The frankness with which the subject matter is handled points up the movies pre-Code status.<br /><br />Marvelous Aline MacMahon as the sympathetic head nurse is the calm center of the film the rock around which all the currents flow. Able to handle any crisis or emergency she is the mothers best sometimes last friend. Surrounding MacMahon is a bevy of excellent costars: Loretta Young as a convicted murderess released from prison long enough to give birth; Eric Linden as her frightened young husband; brassy Glenda Farrell as a dame who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother in for her sixth birthing; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as thoughtful compassionate doctors and Frank McHugh as a comically frantic father-to-be.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize Bobs Watson as a wee tyke who wants to see the Stork; Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a `little soldier; Gilbert Roland as a distraught Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as a snooty doctors wife interested in adopting Farrells son - all uncredited.<br /><br />There are a few absurdities in the plot - some of the mothers are obviously much too old; Farrell becomes blatantly drunk in the Ward but none of the staff seem to notice; an obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will - but this really only enhances the quirky entertainment value of the film and keeps things from becoming too serious.',pos
'Election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by Johnnie To.<br /><br />To marvellously casted Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for Ho Sing society a 100 year old trial society.<br /><br />While Lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times Big D is not only impatient but also thinks that he is on top of everything. Lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years. To have the total control of the gang the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a Dragon Baton which represents power and authority. Big D was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members. He ordered his man to get the Baton before it falls onto the hands of Lok.<br /><br />While Big D is getting the Baton Lok has other plans for him.<br /><br />This is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed. Johnnie To puts the greed of the human beings in the movie where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one. However no single bullet is used hardly any gangfights are involved in Election. Its the battle of the wits that makes Election stands out of the rest.<br /><br />Apart from Maggie Shiu the only actress in Election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie masculinity rules the whole movie. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung who was seen in Tos previous film are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively. Together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script it makes the only HK movie to represent Cannes Fil Festival 2005.<br /><br />Election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie.',pos
'Marlon Brando had long since lost interest in acting when he made this film. His performance as The Swede is the worst of his career and that is precisely what he intended it to be. He doesnt overact. Instead he simply acts in a bizarre fashion and pokes fun at his embarrassingly gargantuan girth. The scene where Brando climbs over the toilet stall is probably the worst funniest moment in the history of cinema. As we witness him fall head-first into a toilet it is hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who starred in A Streetcar Named Desire On the Waterfront and The Godfather.<br /><br />I guess the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in his later years. Was he sick of the movie business? Did he just like making a complete and utter fool out of himself? I guess well never know. But this film serves as a fascinating study as to what bad acting is all about.<br /><br />On that note watch fellow acting veteran Donald Sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines embarrassed at himself for agreeing to participate in this travesty.',neg
'Dogmatic as another reviewer described this film is a fitting word. The directors idea was to present Bach without plot acting fun theatrics dialog narrative or drama. Mission accomplished Monsieur Straub. Pretentious? Yes. Cinematic? No way. This is anti-cinema. No one moves. Hardly anyone talks. The camera holds static shots for 10-12 minutes at a time: very very occasionally the camera will dolly in. You may catch a glimpse of Gustav Leonhardts fingers moving over the keys. Thats it.<br /><br />If you like the idea of staring at the back of a harpsichordists (bewigged) head for 7 minutes at a stretch while listening to Bach this is the film for you. Id rather listen to Bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.',neg
'Some time ago I saw this when HBO was showing it and from what I saw of it it seemed like a good movie. so Im in Blockbuster today and I see it there with the DVDS and I decide what the hell. So I rent it. After I finished watching it I was in shock of how good it was.<br /><br />This movie just touched my heart. Everything in it was so amazing. The stories the actors the dark humor the MUSIC!!! Oh dont get me started on the music in this film. PT Andderson is one of the greats. Definitely the best thing to come out since Quentin Tarantino(a god.)<br /><br />After I finished the first viewing I watched it again with Andersons commentary (I was suprised on how such a cool guy he is.)<br /><br />Anybody who is interested in movies at all should watch this movie if they havent already. Anderson is obviously a film lover. In the movie he rips off so many other directors tecniques. Such as the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water. Obviously ripped off from I Am Cuba. But I have no beef what so ever with that. The film is very respectable with its ripoffs.<br /><br />I recomend this film to anybody who can deal with some of the content of the film(porn.)<br /><br />10/10',pos
'With an interesting premise (in the conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear) this should have been a good film. But the story is sabotaged by the directors overriding infatuation with his own cleverness twinned with a very poor script.<br /><br />Yes the natural setting is beautiful and yes the movie is authentic to its 19th century historical setting. But the filmmaker keeps gilding the lily over and over again adding layer upon layer of over-the-top musical accompaniment not to mention a completely unnecessary voice-over to the soundtrack that ultimately overwhelm the viewer and by calling attention to themselves take away from the story.<br /><br />To me it was clear the director with his microscopic closeups and the endless recurrence of the musical motif of Danny Boy (of all things!) was trying to make a New Zealand version of an epic Sergio Leone film something on the order of Once Upon A Time In The West. But given the earnestness of the story (most of Leones westerns were tongue-in-cheek) not to mention that its no longer 1968 he succeeds in making a parody of one.<br /><br />Too bad.',neg

They bumble around fight to stock banjo musicogle women and act like pathetic excuses of humanity. The characters are so bad they should count as a crime against humanity.',neg
'If you havent figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes. Lilia is a widow. She has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out. She has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger. While checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared...the cabaret where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her. The film is very misogamist. Its portrayal of men is dismal. Which is rather odd as Lilia stoops to jiggle around for them not for money but just for the hell of it. When she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again. She does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention. The other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short-lived. Not short enough I say. She does find romance however brief  with you guessed it....No surprises here we didnt see coming. Though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way. Maybe this film just isnt targeting my demographic- 30 Male',neg
'I saw the German version of the movie in German television and I was really amazed. I generally like to see documentaries but I cant remember to have seen one that is better than Earth. I knew some of the scenes from Youtube videos that I found by random browsing. I also remember to have seen parts of the film on multimedia stores running on the displayed high definition TVs. After seeing the movie its obvious to me why the footage is so popular among Youtube users and multimedia retail managers: Its just so awesome and spectacular that you cant help but stare on the screen no matter if youre generally interested in nature documentaries or not.<br /><br />Without hesitating a 10 out of 10. For sure there are more thrilling movies but in regard of documentaries Earth is definitely one of the best of its genre.',pos

'Ive read up a little bit on Che before watching this film and you wanna know something he was a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other Latin Americans in general! Now I dont know about others but to me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay their fair share. However the powerful elite obviously werent going to go for that. So rather than understanding what Che Guevera wanted they were forced to kill him in attempting to suppress the revolution. It didnt work since there were too many of his other followers who only picked up where he left off. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As far as Im concerned and as Che said it himself right before he died: If you kill me thats fine. But youre only killing a man youll NEVER kill the cause! I couldnt have said it any better myself.<br /><br />But ... ANYWAYS.... thats why I give this film a 7 out of 10.',pos
'TWINS EFFECT is a poor film in so many respects. The only good element is that it doesnt take itself seriously. Other than that this is not really a movie but rather a merchandising tool for the films two stars popular pop idols in their native Hong Kong.<br /><br />The film itself is poorly constructed and acted. The direction offers up some silly martial arts which is odd since the action director (and supposedly co-director) is Donnie Yen. Like many Hong Kong films geared for the teen audience the major fanbase of actors like the Twins (the two girls who stars in this film) and Ekin Cheng there is so much bad music to prod the audience into believing certain scenes are funny clever etc.<br /><br />The final conclusion: Its all for naught. Even as a fan of Hong Kong movies this is a poor film. Not funny enough not serious enough and just generally too bubble gum fake for its own good.<br /><br />3 out of 10.<br /><br />(Go to http://www.nixflix.com for a more in-depth review of this movie and other foreign films)',neg

'I think a person would be well-advised to read or see (I favour reading) Twelfth Night before seeing or re-seeing Shes The Man. The movie is good on its own but comparing the two and looking for the in-jokes makes it a lot more fun. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think hed give a thumbs-up.<br /><br />Harld Bloom said in Shakespeare The Invention of the Human that most of the people in Twelfth Night need to be locked up. Malvolio the person Malcolm is based on is-for no good reason. People in Shes The Man are sane in contrast. For instance Duke Orsino is far more leval than the Duke of Orsino. He also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay. He displays a lot of self-control.<br /><br />Its a teen comedy (a clean one) so it doesnt have the dark edges of the play. For instance Olivia in the play is mourning the death of her brother. In the movie she has been dumped.<br /><br />If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the play they dont have the same attention in the movie.<br /><br />The in-jokes are quite often quick. The hairdresser Pauls last name is given once. It is Antonio. Lots of people whove read the play say that Antonio has more love for a man than is just friendship. Deep love between men was noted in those days. Some see a sexual side to it-homosexuality was illegal.<br /><br />The only line from the play I caught is where Duke Orsino quotes the coach on greatness during the soccar game. In the play it is said by Malvolio quoting Maria).',pos

'This is a film that was very well done. I had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and have been waiting for its release! Cheers to the director and all the actors. The supporting cast gave Eva Mendez what she needed to take this to the top. As everyone else here states the latter portion of the film is riveting. Katie Cassidy did an amazing job with her character being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made. She has quite the career ahead of her. I was amazed at her performance. I completely enjoyed the film questioned my values in life and priorities and am a better person for it! A great message lies within the film. Release it so all can enjoy!',pos
'I passed this one on the shelf a few times looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes (with tiny names) on the front and wondering if I was missing something. The other night it was on one of the movie channels and I tuned in. I missed nothing.<br /><br />I must admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that. Given the slow plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 I seriously doubt it.<br /><br />The lead character starts the movie in classic I dont know how to start my movie style with a long tiresome monologue about how he doesnt want to get sued. Its not funny. Its not even remotely funny. Others have commented on the San Franclisco bit; ok a small chuckle the first time he says it. Then he grinds it into the ground smiling at the camera like its the funniest thing ever written. Get over yourself. In fact I think the talking to the camera bit was the reason I instantly disliked the film. Dont assume familiarity with your audience. Familiarity is _earned_ much like respect.<br /><br />From there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp. I didnt realize hes Jewish; its a discredit to Jewish comedians to call this Jewish humor. Its just unfunny humor. Just because youre Jewish doesnt mean you have a knack for the comedy. A WASP Spalding Gray does a better job of self-analytical humor than this guy so obviously its not about ethnicity.<br /><br />If one of the bits I had seen had worked I might have stuck around. But some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with then listing them for five long minutes doesnt make a great movie.<br /><br />This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Office Space. Dont let yourself become a victim of target marketing. Just say no to Haiku Tunnel.',neg
'I actually first watched One Dark Night in the theater & wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper. I loved it then & I still love it. The storyline revolves around two people. First of all one woman learns that her father has telekenisis after his death. She then has feelings herself about the strange powers of her father even in his death. The mauseleum hes buried in plays host to the other main person a high school girl doing anything to get in with a group of girls that just want to torment her & dare her to stay in the mauseleum all night to join their group. They go back in the night to scare her & find scares for themselves. The cast is led by Meg Tilly with supporting roles by Adam West and one of my personal favorites Elizabeth Daily aka E.G. Daily.

'As a member of the cast I was a member of the band at all the basketball games I would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot. Seems that the U of O sign was shown. While we were shooting we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff. Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men I have ever met. Quite a time for a young 20 year old. BUt certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60s and early 70s despite what Hollywood may think. Trombone player from Oregon',neg
'CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; an Italian crime drama partially filmed in Hamburg Germany. An easily forgotten movie. Even in spite of a good car chase sequence this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly. A new Don takes over a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. Unwritten laws and ethics of the Mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence breed the same in return. This can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics. Just the look of the film brings back memories of American drive-in fare. Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas cant boost the calibre of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also stars with:Paola Tedesco Guido Lollobrigida Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.',neg
'About 15 minutes in my wife was already wanting to leave. Not so much because of the material but the lack thereof. They decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff shouldve been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could. When this would let up (very rare) wed sit back and watch (not laughing mind you) and wait for the next gross-out or offensive remark(s). After about 35 minutes we both got up and left. Everything wed read said how great this was. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert actually called it intelligent and said it wasnt a crude sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Along with Be Cool its the only other movie Ive ever walked out on...and I have no regrets. Im sick of trying to go see comedies in America.',neg
'Erika Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. At the start of the film we see her arriving home late. When her older mother protests Erika goes into a frenzy attacking the older woman without pity. Erika as it turns out is a musical teacher of a certain renown in the conservatory where she teaches. When we next see her she is the model of composure but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels he is wasting his time and hers. The same goes for the insecure Anna a talented girl who Erika hates maybe because she sees in the young woman a promise that she is not willing to promote.<br /><br />At the end of the day we watch Erika as she goes into an amusement area and proceeds to one of the cabins where pornographic material is shown. Erika is transfixed as she watches the things that are being performed on the screen. On another occasion Erika comes to a drive-in where a movie is in progress. Her attention goes toward a parked car in which two lovers are performing a sex act. The camera lingers on Erika as she is lost in reverie watching what the two lovers are doing until she is surprised by the young man inside the car. Erika flees horrified shes been discovered.<br /><br />When a wealthy couple invites Erika to perform in a recital in their opulent home she meets an eager young man Walter who is related to the hosts. Walter is immediately taken with Erikas playing; the young man is a talented pianist himself. His eagerness to compliment Erika is met with skepticism on her part. Walter decides to audition for Erikas master class and is accepted.<br /><br />Thus begins Walter pursuit of Erika who is taken aback when she realizes what the young mans motives really are. In turn Erika begins to fantasize about Walter in ways that only her mind could imagining what she would like him do when and if they get together. Walter gets turned off by the letter Erika has written to him detailing sexual acts that are repugnant to the young man.<br /><br />The films ending reminded us of the last sequence of Mr. Hanekes current Cache. We are taken to a concert hall where Erika is going to perform. She is seen stalking the lobby looking for the arrival of Walter who goes on into the hall without noticing her. Erikas expression to the camera reveals a lot more of her state of mind in that last minutes of the film. As she flees the lobby area after inflicting a wound on herself the camera abandons her and concentrates on the buildings facade that seems to stay on the screen for a long time.<br /><br />La Pianiste is a personal triumph for Isabelle Huppert. This magnificent actress does one of her best appearances on the screen guided by the sure hand of Michael Haneke one of the most interesting directors working today. Ms. Hupperts works with economic gestures yet she projects so much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika.<br /><br />The supporting cast does wonders under the directors guidance. Annie Girardot always excellent is perfect as Erikas mother. She seems to be the key of whatever went wrong with her daughter. There is a hint of incest that is played with subtleness in the context of the film. Benoit Magimel is perfectly cast as Walter. This young actor does a wonderful job in the film as the young man so in love with a woman that is possessed by demons that hell never be able to chase away or get her to love him in a normal manner.<br /><br />Michael Haneke films are always disturbing to watch yet they offer so many rewards because he dares to go where other men dont. The magnificent music heard in the film are mainly by Schubert and Schumann two composers that are Erikas own favorites. The movie is helped tremendously by Christian Bergers cinematography.',pos

'Several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film. First the scenery and special effects are incredible -- the best and if everything else worked as well its austere presence might have made it a great film.<br /><br />But as soon as the actors open their mouths you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie. The story itself is full of cleché and melodrama and the dialogue is some of the worst Ive ever seen.

'Luis Bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was obscure to me. My first experience with him was The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie often considered his greatest work with which I became so frustrated and bored that I eventually shut the tape off. Likewise Belle de Jour which is almost certainly his best known film and also generally considered one of his many masterpieces didnt interest me very much at all. I didnt hate it like I did Discreet but I didnt like it. Third I saw LAge dOr. Finally I had gotten somewhere. Fourth Los Olvidados also good. Still neither LAge dOr nor Los Olvidados blew me away. Great films but not masterpieces.<br /><br />Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel and I like it just a tad more than those other two. It is about a priest from Spain now in Mexico who refuses to live in the kind of luxury most priests live in. He wants to be more like Jesus leading the meekest life possible. Hes also willing to forgive everyone for anything and to suffer without protest. Im pretty sure Bunuel does not sympathize with the character and sees him as rather self-righteous. However I only assume that because of my knowledge of the director whose most famous quotation is Thank God Im still an atheist which he apparently said in an interview over this very film (I get this information from John Baxters book about Bunuel if youre interested). The interviewer who dragged those words from Bunuels mouth must have been himself confused about Nazarin. One who was more predisposed to believe in religious conviction who also knows nothing about Bunuel might see the priest as a heroic figure. This is especially true if that viewer has his/her own criticisms of organized religion. The priest may be somewhat self-righteous but he seems to be basically a good man. When he harbors a violent prostitute in his room in order to protect her (and presumably to save her soul) people begin to find out and assume that their relationship is sexual. His superiors assume the same and punish him for it. Later on he suffers even worse punishments from clerics.',pos

'Divorced single mom in picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur into action her dormant love life. Pet project for actress/co-producer Kate Capshaw who gives a warm nicely-modulated lead performance yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so erratic that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in. Initially Capshaws Helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her (an interesting visual joke) but the first person they do this ploy with is Ellen DeGeneres who doesnt play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick. Different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick and the continuity is extremely choppy. Supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott who mostly acts with his shirt off) is very good but they cant save the final act which is disappointing. Low-keyed in a quirky pleasant way but it is blandly good-natured nothing more. **1/2 from ****',neg

Im not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers...and I always feel bad saying that because I know how hard it is to do both...but it was basically a two-hour waste of my life.

'Though not a horror film in the traditional sense this creepy little film delivers the goods. It seems a vampire is loose in a small German town draining its victims of their blood. Police Inspector Karl Brettschneider Melvyn Douglas in one of his early roles is skeptical believing a crazed killer not a vampire is running amok. The only one who believes him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray) the inspectors girlfriend and lab assistant to Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who though apparently an eminent scientist goes along with the vampire theory. The townspeople suspect the weirdo Herman Gleib played with his usual frenzy by Dwight Frye who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role. The film contains quite a bit of humor which helps relieve some of the intensity involved with all the murders being committed. One funny part has Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne) Ruth Bertins aunt thinking weird Herman has turned not into a bat but into a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a good comedy team.<br /><br />This budget movie brings in elements from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari with Dr. Niemann using the power of suggestion to make a somnambulist carry out his orders from Frankenstein by using the human blood to help create life in the laboratory and Dracula since the murders are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a bloodsucker. Thses elements are mixed well by director Frank R. Strayer with a little comedy thrown in for good measure. The concoction works. The restored version I viewed used tinting to increase the spooky atmosphere. So try to see the this version if possible.',pos
'<br /><br />Back in his youth the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin but his family forbid it. Many decades later the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon the sister is bored with brother #1 and jumps in the bed of brother #2.<br /><br />One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.<br /><br />Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.<br /><br />The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him but no -- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.',neg
'As Muppet movies go this is easily and clearly the best. It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age a solid script and some great Disneyesque songs and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Hensons talent. The story is basic and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable.<br /><br />This is simply fun but it is also a well made well written beautifully endearing classic.<br /><br />It rates an 8.9/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.',pos
'The 1970s opened the door to the largest most diverse era of film in the history. Some films were great (The Godfather The Conversation Mean Streets Chinatown The French Connection Five Easy Pieces Jaws McCabe And Mrs. Miller) Others were not so great (The Getaway The Outfit Badge 373 Joe The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three Brewster McCloud Castle Keep) And others were barely worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Yet every one was a fresh breath of air compared to todays Corporate Hollywood. Where every film is given a Big Weekend to recoup its cost. Or go straight to HBO and rental.<br /><br />What Decade does so well is to relate the sudden and rarely experienced sensation of freedom to be given money to make and direct a film. Perhaps personal. Perhaps not. Sometime with a clutch of extras. Sometimes in the middle of a busy street before the cops show up. Long before the Corporate Overseers Suits Committees and Lawyers ever became part of The System.<br /><br />The commentaries are superb. Especially Julie Christie and Dennis Hopper. Though as you listen youll slowly discover just how many Big Directors today (Coppola Scorsese Ron Howard Dennis Hopper Peter Bogdonovitch) got stated as Roger Corman Commandos. Working long hours with short pay. Shooting a film in under a month. Learning all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it themselves. Turning in product that was on-time and under-budget.<br /><br />See Decade for its message. And for a long and varied list of films to watch made through those wondrously turbulent years.<br /><br />Though I would not complain if IFC decided to devote another documentary solely to that most under-rated Grand Pioneer of film Roger Corman.',pos
'Allen and Julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night. No one knows who killed the little girl but its why they moved to the mountains. So the couple moves into this cabin and its haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it.<br /><br />This movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump. Some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part I didnt expect. It was a pretty good movie that wasnt the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good.<br /><br />I also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends. It is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie.',pos
'As other reviewers have noted this movie is a cross between (i.e. stolen from) stories we have seen before. Specifically this looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter inserted into Mad Max. Remove Clints cigar and replace with a cigarette; remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle and voilà an updated drifter. In this movie the hero is even more blatantly a Savior than High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair suffers a wound to his left side and his entry into town is preceded by a plea for salvation by the surviving townspeople--a pretty transparent reference to a Second Coming. I watched the movie on a hot humid morning. Sleep was impossible and upon arising at 4:30 am there was nothing else on TV. So the movie served its purpose. While unoriginal with characters that are almost comic caricatures the movie is still somewhat entertaining...at least at 4:30 in the morning.',neg
'Early heavy war-time propaganda short urging people to be careful with their spending practices in effort to prevent any runaway inflation.<br /><br />Using scare guilt and patriotic jingoistic rhetoric which was normal for the time the government was concern that the sudden war-time production and therefore wage increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the war.<br /><br />It truly is a window into the past historically and culturally.',neg
'Opie Tom Gilsonwas my brotherso I went to see the movie and I never looked at it again in all these years. Sorry! it was bad. Im told I have to write 10 lines so Ill put a little trivia in. Tom and Tuesday Weld were to be  introduced  in this picture and Tom was told to take Tuesday to the premiere but Tom said no he was going with Joan Collins and he did and because he did only Tuesday Weld was Introduced. I found this very funny back then and still do. The movie while the concept was a funny one and the actors in it were impressive but some how it just didnt come out funny.The continuity was abstract at bestit was like I was watching 2 different movies at the same timeeach running into the other.

'Now I flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you watch a car crash...<br /><br />I appreciate the fact its a spoof but that should not stop me from criticising the god-awful directing acting and dialogue. Seriously this rated as one of the poorest movies I have seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper and a poor one at that...<br /><br />Okay - a few criticisms (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attack him so we assume its a heart attack) the army then launch shells rockets bullets at the monster - which was feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive (2) the army attack from about 100 yards away and we see a flame-thrower being used - geez those things have a range of no more than 30 metres! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling; the monster drops the kid and the soldiers dont try to shoot the monster??? come on! (4) the monster looks like it something out of Power Rangers! (5) there is one scene where the five good guys (the priest the girl the doctor the reporter and the kid) all look shocked and we get reactions (along the lines of hand to mouth) one after the other - so natural! (6) the general just runs away time after time (7) the general refuses to try electricity and wouldnt listen (8) the acting is awful (9) did I mention the rubber suit monster???? (10) that god-awful music non-stop!',neg
'An okay film with a fine leading lady but a terrible leading man. Stephan Jenkins who plays the husband is a truly bad actor. Joyce Hyser on the other hand is the movies saving grace. Shes the best actor of the bunch.<br /><br />NOTE* the first comment by the fellow who heaped praise upon the movie (and according to his IMDB.com account has only written ONE review -- and guess for what movie?) is obviously a plant. While the movie is nicely shot its by no means subtle or great or whatever other hypobolic descriptions the reviewer used.<br /><br />Art of Revenge is a fair movie but its a big tease. It offers up all manner of sexual situations but never goes through with it. Like watching a Skin Flick on Cinemax but with all the naughty bits edited out.<br /><br />The film as a whole is a bit unfocused and the ending and much of the third act is really a big mess. Theres a twist ending of course since every movie nowadays finds it necessary to have a twist ending.<br /><br />A 4 out of 10.<br /><br />',neg
'Empire of Passion starts out deceptively - that is if youre immediately expecting it to be a horror movie. Its like a riff on James M. Cains The Postman Always Rings Twice at first: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful hard-working wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when hes not around and shes at home with the baby the feisty and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes around to bring some goodies for Seki... and a little extra. Theyre soon sleeping together but after he does something to her (lets just say a shave) he knows that hell find out and immediately proposes that they kill Gisaburo. They drink him up strangle him and then toss him down a well. Naturally this will come back to haunt them - but that its literally at least to them (at first super-terrified Seki and then only later on skeptical Toyoji) changes gears into the Kaidan a Japanese ghost story.<br /><br />This is a film where the horror comes not simply out of oh ghost ah but out of the total dread that builds for the characters. In a way theres the mechanics of a film-noir at work throughout if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century Japanese village as opposed to an American city or small town (i.e. the snooping cop the evidence found possibly by another word getting around suspicions aroused etc). Its compelling because Seiko actually was against the plan from the start manipulated by the lustful but ill-prepared Toyoji and her reactions to Gisaburos re-appearances are staggering to her. Take the one that comes closest to poetry: Gisaburos ghost pale-blue face and mostly silent chilling stare motions for Seiko to get on the rickshaw. She does reluctantly and he pushes her around on a road she doesnt know in the wee hours before dawn surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric.<br /><br />While it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end theres so much here that director Oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work. After hitting it huge in the international cinema world with In the Realm of the Senses (which ironically got banned in his own country) he made something that he claimed was even *more* daring that Senses. Maybe he was right; Empire of Passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor (also starring Tatsuya Fuji a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range) but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread. You can believe in ghosts in this story but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two would-be lovebirds will go. The snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries: the fate of their very souls is at stake.<br /><br />And Oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp (sadly it wouldnt surprise me if an American remake was already in the works) and crafts shot after gorgeous shot with repetition working its way into the mis-en-scene (i.e. the shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking on that road the camera at a dutch angle the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue) as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after I finish typing this (i.e. Toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion or how Seikos nude body is revealed after she becomes blind). Its daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit- not to be confused with the spiritual though there may be something with that as well- about life and deaths connections to one another inextricably. Its a classic waiting to be discovered.',pos
'In the title I write that the story is ludicrous. below Ill elaborate and tell you why it in my humble opinion ruins this movie.<br /><br />Gere and Danes are doing their jobs and while its not their best work its quite OK. The rest of the cast though is doing a really poor job. Mind you this is not entirely the actors fault. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth. All other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth or the character is such a cliché that it doesnt matter how hard the actors try.<br /><br />The director has a bit of a Se7en complex but looking merely at the direction I think he does an OK job.<br /><br />But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways. First of all its a bad movie script. The characters are shallow (except for Geres and Danes characters) the villains are clichés and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable. Besides this the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years. Its the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them. Its also the kind of movie that says albeit only between the lines that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial judge or jury. And of course according to the movie everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance.<br /><br />So if youre going to film school and need an example of a bad script or if youre writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost. See it. For everyone else I recommend another movie.',neg
'Really I think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film. In fact the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining.<br /><br />Yes the script is a little convoluted but thats the genre. The film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. Just like all the old noir classics this too has a screenplay that twists you around so that you dont always know how to make sense of it at first and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together. Thats the genre. In general the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and in turn surprised without abandoning the viewer.<br /><br />Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is she looks great and she speaks her double-entendre laden dialog in such a way as to zhuzh it up into something mysterious sexy and fun.<br /><br />The direction is more than passable because lets face it--you have to keep an audience interested in the did she or didnt she? question for two hours. In addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by Stone this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time with straight industrial lines to go along with Stones sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful--press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye.<br /><br />The film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real particularly the sex. Katherine Tramell is bisexual...how shocking! becomes treated more matter-of-factly here and typically the sexuality of the film is used to better effect. It is still titillating but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first. I wont say that it isnt still somewhat of a gimmick because lets face it this film is supposed to be fun.<br /><br />And a fun film it is. It may be an easy target but if you watch it for what it is: a noirish femme-fatale driven twisty sexy did-she-or-didnt-she who-dunnit youre bound to enjoy it (no pun intended).',pos
'I found Dominion to be a lousy attempt to continue the success of the story. The original movie was a story about evil and how it can infiltrate our lives.<br /><br />Schraders version is lacking in evil. Viewers do not get an overwhelming sense of dread fear or even foreboding. Harlins version offers evident evil shows violations of the churchs sanctity and builds a convincing story that is plausible given Father Merrins background. Schraders story leaves one wondering exactly what happened. Dominion does not evoke the emotions of the viewers to empathize with Father Merrin and leaves the viewer wondering exactly why he was troubled in the first place.<br /><br />Anyone interested in seeing a sequel which lives up to the original should see Exorcist: The Beginning.',neg
'FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! Ive been waiting for this film to come out for almost a year and finally saw it at the premiere in SB. I met a few of the actors who were really nice and who were great in the movie. i watched the trailer so many times that i didnt know what to expect but got totally sucked in. the film was really beautiful to look at it and the music was good too. i recommend it to anyone whos a ryan donowho fan and dominique swain was good in it too. the other actors were good also great. I hope it comes out on DVD soon!!!!!<br /><br />i first got into ryan from watching the OC and then saw him in a bunch of good indies like Imaginary Heroes.

'An anthology is always risky business and I think this endeavor should be praised. Theres a lot of talent involved here. A great many talented actors directors and writers. Unfortunately I couldnt really enjoy this movie based on three issues I had.<br /><br />First of all the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality. And unfortunately some of them clash with the others. <br /><br />Secondly several segments feel underdeveloped to me. Like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition. Im not talking about happy endings here (or even an ending period) but rather they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in. <br /><br />Last but not least I did not feel New-York and its inhabitants were properly portrayed.<br /><br />What youre left with is high-brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied.',neg

'I can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978. HBO would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence. Back then it was UNRATED and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay television...especially back then. I would love to see it now as an adult where I would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it. It was probably the closest thing I had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8. Luckily I had stupid babysitters and party-going parents on the weekends. Most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking into houses to sniff underwear feeding on a strangers breast milk on a public bus and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off. A very racy film for the early 70s. Until I checked IMDb I had no idea this movie had such a following. Most people I talk to have never heard of it.',pos
'i like Jane Austin novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies and Im half way through Mansfield Park. But i couldnt stand Emma. I gave up on the book after 2 chapters and by the end of the movie i couldnt care less about Emma. She didnt seem to change at all. Maybe it was Paltrows acting (which as excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest for the movie. Dunno. <br /><br />The costumes are nice but the dancing was clumsy compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.<br /><br />I gave it a 2 basically for the fact Knightly is bloody gorgeous and although it as a rather patchy performance for Ewan McGregor i liked his singing.',neg
'This was one of the best movies I have seen. The movie relates to real life and how drugs CAN play a major part. Although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget I found it to be exhilarating to watch.<br /><br />Some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction. However when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters there is no direction is life. I feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptations.<br /><br />Most of the cast are newcomers to the industry. However they all pulled it off very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately.<br /><br />I think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control. This movie might just scare them enough to change their ways.',pos
'This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years. His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it. I HIGHLY recommend this one. The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow but the ending jokes in French are quite good because you dont have to speak French to get it (although if you do it is still hilarious). Also the parts about being a transvestite are quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great but funny the first time. Skip over those if you can. Its almost not worth watching. However this really is a funny funny stand-up show that everyone should see. I was dead at the time!',pos

'This movie should have ended as soon as the joke about Bebes Kids is told in the opening.

Liken it to taking the point of one of Jerry Seinfelds jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie. This movie had to be self-serving because I can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar. Whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.',neg
'This splicing of THE SEARCHERS is one of the weirdest films Ive ever seen filmed by a Briton in a strange unfamiliar Mexico. Its often said that the best films about America are made by foreigners who can approach the familiar with an outsiders eye. But this crackpot film is something else. Though set ostensibly in post-Civil War America this isnt an America recognisable from myth cinema TV etc. The film has an air of timeless fable about it while dealing specifically with Western mythology.<br /><br />Director Harvey uses the title horse as a focus for interconnecting stories all dealing with the traditional Western clash of the primitive and civilisation. The former seems to have the upper hand. The vast scrub and desert of the films landscape is unbroken ripe for allegories of the mind. The only brief sites of civilisation are a stagecoach of missionaries and landowners and their hacienda from both of which derive behaviour that is anything but civilised.<br /><br />The basic story intercuts three stories. In one an aimless deserter Pike having lost his trading partner steals a miraculous horse Eagles Wing so-called because of its grace and speed. In the second an Indian White Bull owner of this horse waylays a stagecoach and kidnaps one of its female occupants. In the third the Spanish men sent to find her ignore this quest in favour of a murderous plundering spree.<br /><br />Although a revisionist Western the treatment of the Indian is problematic. Unlike Pike his character is never explained forever inscrutable denied a voice except for an excruciating snatch of song. When hes not a strange Other hes a symbol whose role isnt entirely worked out - at one point a savage brute at another he epitomises nature and freedom.<br /><br />But Pike notes at the beginning that the film will attend to the period of primitivism before civilisation. In many ways the film resembles 2001 - A SPACE ODYSSEY especially its opening sequence. Part of the films power lies in the connections made between the three disparate characters forcing us to view the mythic struggles and quests in a different light. Indian culture and Catholicism is linked by superstition ritual greed and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic. White Bull is demonised by both Pike and the abductee as a bastard unwittingly revealing the tactic of illegitimacy used by colonising whites who infantilised the natives becoming themselves necessary fathers.<br /><br />Unlike a traditional Western concerned with making history civilisation and progress this film is a double detective story interrogating the past tracks remains.<br /><br />What gives this film its remarkable uniqueness I think is despite Maltins racism its Britishness. The climactic stand-off is more like an Arthurian joust. The film itself bravely eschews dialogue for the most part creating the kind of visual and aural tapestry Malick missed in THE THIN RED LINE and something few Hollywood directors would have dared. The existential doubling and quest motifs are more European myth than American (resembling another British Harvey Keitel movie THE DUELLISTS).<br /><br />Most astonishing is the use of nature. Most Westerns use landscape as an awe-inspiring backdrop: there is little sense of actually living in the West. In many ways EAGLES WING is like a Powell and Pressberger film with nature a powerful pantheistic character in its own right - alive dangerous hostile beautiful. There is a sublime scene reminiscent of A CANTERBURY TALE when jewellery left as a trap by White Bull in the trees is suddenly blown in the wind: there is a haunting tingling magical thrilling effect more reminiscent of the Arabian Nights than a horse opera. Heartstopping.',pos
'After Garbos introduction to sound in Clarence Browns Anna Christie Jacques Feyder made a German version of the movie where all of the cast except for Garbo were different. While the American version is still more available in the USA and most of the American viewers have primarily seen this version the Germna Anna Christie is more likely to be viewed in Europe. As I have seen both films I feel the right to compare the two closely-knit productions. Is Jacques Feyders film different? Is it better than Clarence Browns? <br /><br />In this analysis I would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common. They have identical sets very similar scripts and the same chronologically presented scenes. Here you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life. Here you also have the humorous though a bit shorter sequence in the amusement park. However when emphasizing Garbo herself I address the first difference. She does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking. The viewer concentrates more on her acting than on the way she speaks which occurred most probably to 1931 viewers. Garbo was very good in American film and she is also very good here. Yet to me she seems even more genuine in the German version. It is noticeable that Garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much (the effort that was artificially created by the sensation: GARBO TALKS!). Her German is not very well pronounced; yet no one cares: everything is perfectly understood. Therefore I can easily say the same I did in my American version comment: Skaal Greta Garbo! <br /><br />Yet the film differs in one very important issue: the rest of the cast. Here comes the question: which portrayal seems more captivating which one is better for sure? The differences are filled with varieties. Salka Viertel (or Salka Steuerman) Garbos lifelong friend does not do the equally great job as Marie Dressler in the role of Marthy Owens. She is not bad she is different sometimes overacts (from todays perspective) but is no longer that genuine in the role as Marie Dressler who still amuses us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time. Some people even claim that Dressler was better than Garbo in the film and that opinion though appears to be questionable of course carries some truth. Theo Shall is more sympathetic as Matt than Charles Bickford but when applied to him this is not the matter of performance so much as the mater of looks.<br /><br />Who shines in the German Anna Christie who is really worth greatest attention is Hans Junkermann in the role of Chris Christopherson Annas father. George F. Marion vs Hans Junkermann is like a day vs night difference. Junkermann portrays a real alcohol addict a man with hopes with fears who overdoes the care of his daughter. The scene of Annas first meeting with her father is truly magnificent the opening moment of Chris conversation with Marthy is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance. Junkermann is the Chris whom you like who you sometimes laugh at whom you sympathize with who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic sailor in your mind. Great! <br /><br />If you have seen the American Anna Christie and have a chance to get the German version I would highly recommend to you this movie because its a slightly different look at the story a nice and accurate way to compare a fine enrichment to Clarence Browns movie and foremost a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance: Hans Junkermanns. Skaal or Prost Hans Junkermann!',pos
'This film pulls you in from the get-go because it grabs our attention by acknowledging yeah that this story is opening with a cliché  a funeral.<br /><br />In hands other than Judis I wouldnt have given it an 8 as this material has been done over and over again: The great reunion of a once famous pick one please team army platoon theatre group singers band.<br /><br />But this movie never stoops to cheap sentimentalization and when you think it is going to it swoops off in another direction. A case in point is the flowers that are sent by an admirer to Judi.<br /><br />The band members are an interesting group and ride above the clichés too. One is in jail one has found religion one is an alkie and one has sunk into dementia. But the joie de vivre rediscovered by Judi ignited by her granddaughters interest carries us along and makes us overlook the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot.<br /><br />The cast are a whos who of talent Leslie Caron the incomparable jazzist Cleo Laine with her amazing high notes a last performance from Joan Sims brava Joan a cute as a button flirtatious Ian Holm having a ball and Olympia Dukakis as a money-grabbing divorcée living in the highlands of Scotland with her ghillie and her whiskey The closing scene is standard Hollywoodland fare the judgmental children of the star converted to fun-loving supporters the old lovers reunited the youngsters swept up in the old timers music.

'Ossessione<br /><br />Luchino Viscontis debut film this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement--well it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes penetrating sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy an assortment of supporting characters--including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Viscontis compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same its incisive and essential although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.',pos

'Yes...Im going with the 1-0 on this and heres why. In the last few years I have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget. Then I stumble upon Nothing. Looked interesting wasnt expecting much though. I was wrong. This was probably one of the funniest movies I have ever had the chance to watch. Dave and Andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember but not over complex to the point of missing the joke. I dont want to remark on any of the actual scenes because I do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once. With more and more pointless concepts coming into movies (you know like killer military jets and fresh remakes that are ruining old classics) This movie will make you happy to say its OK to laugh at Nothing.',pos
'^^contains spoilers^^<br /><br />This movie is utter crap. Do not watch.<br /><br />There is no one in this movie to root for or even like except for the wife and she wins by default. Everyone is selfish and many things happen that make no sense.<br /><br />The acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything. No one can even cry believably.<br /><br />If you leave the room for even a second then something totally out of left field will happen and it will make NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.<br /><br />For example I left the room for a second while Jennie Garths character was sleeping with her manager. I come back seriously about 4 minutes later (also Im pretty sure there was a commercial somewhere in there) and shes sleeping with that Berko guy. <br /><br />I gave up on this movie around the time that Berko was being an ass to his fiancé in the car because she didnt want to call off the wedding.<br /><br />I wasted 2 hours of my life.

'Skippy from Family Ties plays Eddie a wussy metal nerd who gets picked on. When his favorite wussy metal singer Sammi Curr dies he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall. But when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead metal idol. He first gets sucked into ideas of revenge but then he doesnt want to take it as far as Sammi does. Which isnt really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital. This movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say Rock Star. OK maybe a tad more than that piece of junk but you get my point. And how ANYone can root for a guy played by Skippy from Family Ties I havent a clue. The cameo by Gene Simmons is OK and Ozzy Osbourne reaches coherency I applaud him for that but otherwise skip this one.<br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Eye Candy:Elise Richards gets topless an a topless extra at a pool party',neg
'It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact Even by todays standards the film is interesting and provocative <br /><br />Therese and Isabelle are both attending the same girls school Therese is energetic intelligent and becomes a mentor for the innocent naive sweet Isabelle She guides her through a number of exotic experiences including a trip through an exclusive brothel into her first lesbian liaison and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience <br /><br />The film does not exploit any sex nor is there an abundance of nudity... The imagery is effective but sometimes the camera lingers too long and the story goes slowly <br /><br />The director Radley Metzger went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of Henry Paris He always has extremely detailed stories good acting and very high standards of cinematography...<br /><br />Artistically however this is perhaps his most complete His later attempts supplied for entertainment whereas Therese and Isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism...',pos
'Like TALK RADIO THE BOOTH is actually kinda predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened going in THE BOOTH because of- lets face it- the genre and the basic set-up). Thats not necessarily a bad thing in this case. It means in essence that the filmmakers dont punk out in the end the way they mightve in say an American version of this story. THE BOOTH moves inexorably toward its (foregone) conclusion but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of (very scenic) road. It reminds me of Harlan Ellisons spooky short story FLOP SWEAT. The claustrophobia is at times almost palpable. Worth a nice long look.',pos
'So the WWE has done it. They have poured over into film;their first one being See No Evil starring their very own Kane. I caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film...It just seemed to cliché and looked like nothing new. To my surprise it actually wasnt half bad. A viewer stated above that it is good B-horror movie fun and honestly thats the best way to describe it. Now the question I was asking myself was how was Kane going to hold up...Well lets just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the Jacob Goodnight character. He sold the role really well and really did look menacing. But what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around 320 in solid muscle. The acting was decent and the story was nothing new of course but we all know that. The directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done. Considering this was directed by a porn movie director I was quite surprised. Id recommend this movie if youre looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun. Think of this movie as a modern day latter Friday the 13th film. And save room for the ending too cuz its a good one. And stick around after the credits too...',pos
'Sandra the Making of a Woman is a standout among exploitation films and is so for two reasons: (1) an excellent yet effortless performance by Monica Gayle and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the helm of the project. These two talents both of whom are quite underrated make Sandra a film that should be seen.<br /><br />Another key element of the films success is its realism -- there is nothing fake or Hollywood about this set-in-California film. It is truly a slice of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film the simple dresses worn by the character the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bouncing at her front door and Sandra sits on the couch without make-up while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics looking truly as if she just woke up (but nevertheless beautiful) the harmless weirdo Sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra the one-room apartment into which Sandra moves --all of these elements of the film seem totally real and as such the viewer is drawn into Sandras little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class.<br /><br />This film could have easily failed in less competent hands and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions but the Garver/Gale team see to it that Sandra is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film.',pos

The ridiculous. lame swipes at WalMart non-union workers George W Bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional GWB accent that Balwins character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen. As the credits roll the sour grapes continue as Special Thanks are given to Ken Lay and other CEOs from Enron Tyco WorldCom and IMClone. Let me clue you in to something - if you put all your money into one companys stock YOURE AN IDIOT. We dont need this excuse for a movie to tell us that. What a waste of Jim Carreys talent - from the trailer I expected a completely different movie - what I got was a 90 minute DNC commercial on how to scare people into not investing for their own future keep them stupid and keep them dependent on government. No wonder Hollywood is in trouble and cant make a decent movie anymore - maybe you guys could get an original idea and put it on screen for once...although I shouldnt be surprised since Jane Fonda was cast in the original.',neg
'From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of cinematic sludge. Supposedly based on the work of H. Rider Haggard the only similarity it bears to anything Haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in Africa (albeit an Africa that has dinosaurs - which our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes!) and has some characters with the same names.<br /><br />Our heroes (David McCallum Patrick McNee and John Colico) set out to seek treasure armed only with a medallion and end up precisely where the treasure is purely by chance. On the way they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monsters pick up a French chef and McCallum has an affair with the Queen of Phoenicia.<br /><br />Its so ridiculous its a hoot.

'If we compare the movie industry with an ocean we have the tendencies to observe only the surface. Driven by the strong Hollywood marketing force we all saw war movies like Saving Private Ryan The Thin Red Line Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. But underneath the splashy waves grow in silence from time to time less known pearls. When you pick one and look carefully at it you wonder why this pearl lie almost unknown and why its not already on the crown.<br /><br />Stalingrad is such a gem. Why it has a bunch of multi-million dollars rated actors? No. It have thousand of extras? No. It have breathtaking spectacular shiny computerized visual effects?. Not at all. So whats so special? Well in one word its pure past reality recreated and transposed to celluloid fifty years later. The tragedy of the most bloody battle in the history is here. Filthy wounded soldiers Russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion burning villages collapsing buildings decayed suburbs gunfires explosions tanks in flames soldiers shot burned alive ground by tanks in their pits or shred to pieces - you got all. But the real horror is elsewhere. People are reduced to simple pawns without the power to change anything. The soldiers we follow in film try to leave the combat zone and they fail. The civilians stay in prostration in the middle of nowhere only crying for their children killed. Mercyless the huge grinding machine of war melt together humans equipment villages cities - and ask for more victims and destruction over and over.<br /><br />In all this collective insanity a group of German soldiers struggle to survive and to keep at least a minimum level of normality. They do their duty and fight bravely. But as everyone know a battle is almost lost when people start to loose confidence and faith. We see how all those people are abandoned how they plan to desert how they struggle to catch the very last plane to Berlin (full of wounded) how some very bad injured soldiers were treated as simulants and shot how they were forced to execute a small group of Russian civilians including a young boy how they later discovered a place literally full up to the ceiling of food and drinks - destined only for some superior officers of course. One by one they drop dead. The end of the movie is one of the most bitter depressing and touching ending I ever saw all on the magnificent score of The Munich Philarmonic Orchestra. The war destroyed everything in its path.<br /><br />This movie is a must-see for everyone. A true movie-lover should have it in his/her collection. The strong anti-war message must be a warning for all of us. Unfortunately the mankind never learn nor the politicians. Self-destruction is in our DNA and the human pain seem to last forever. Can we be enough reasonable to stop THE WAR?',pos
'This was truly a great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the entire baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very likable actor that is very enjoyable to watch. The chemistry the team had once they got things together was spectacular it just goes to show what you what can accomplish when minds unite as one with one goal. This team came back from the brink having multiple losing seasons to winning just about everything. I love movies like this as they really are very inspirational.<br /><br />On top of that Dennis Quaids character getting a place in the major leagues. You cant do anything but root for this guy. It just seems like when someone is supposed to do something they are going to do that. Things just happen to fall into place and makes everything click.<br /><br />Based on a true story this film will really make you think about the fact that nothing is impossible.',pos
'I disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance. I cant imagine this as even approaching stoner classic. That would be like calling Singles a grunge film. The movie definitely plods along with a murky plot. At times I wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me of watching children play-acting and making the story up as they go along.<br /><br />The characters are wooden the dialog is taxed and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. Who got killed? When? What? And this is how you act when your friend overdoses? Complete lack of emotion and utter disconnect from reality.<br /><br />As for the droning guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene: enough! It was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track loops endlessly in the background neither moving forward or back.<br /><br />I kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall in to order the acting and dialog would improve or something somehow would focus this mess in to a coherent movie. After 112 minutes it never happened.',neg
'I always said that the animated Batman movies were much better than the live action films.<br /><br />Ive seen all of the animated films but out of the bunch this is the poorest and its rather disappointing.<br /><br />Mask of the Phantasm would rank as the best then Worlds Finest then Sub Zero then Return of the Joker and finally this ranks last.<br /><br />In this newest animated movie theres a mysterious new batgirl in Gotham and Batman is intent on discovering whether shes friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeance.<br /><br />But as Bruce gets involved with three young women he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirl.<br /><br />The tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak which was rather disappointing. Bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time the villains are re-used from the last films and while the action scenes are exciting theyre really nothing new. It also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have especially that of Sub-Zero which was heavy in drama and character development.<br /><br />Everything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting for.<br /><br />All the while I really enjoyed this I had a blast and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising but this wasnt as exciting as Id hoped.<br /><br />(**half out of ****)',pos

'Thursday is a good movie but we recognize too much from other movies in its genre and therefor it lacks originality. If you have seen Goodfellas Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction and a bunch of other movies that were inspired by that last one you have seen almost every part from Thursday. There is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in Tarantinos Reservoir Dogs.<br /><br />Still it is a good movie. Because not every part is taken from the same movie the complete thing has some new ideas and some nice touches. The opening sequence to begin with is quite impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart) Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They get into a fight with a clerk in a gas station over a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a cop. Weve already glimpsed at a suitcase with a lot of money in it.<br /><br />Then we meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall) but used to be working with Nick. She doesnt know a thing. Then Nick gives him a call and says that he is coming. We learn that he has screwed his friends over and the problems are about to start.<br /><br />What happens exactly is not for me to reveal but we meet some other characters all interested in the money or the drugs Nick also had with him. Casey has flushed those down the drain.<br /><br />Very funny moments a lot of blood a very funny sub-plot involving actor Michael Jeter and some surprises (although if you really think about it you see them coming) this is a good movie with some very fine performances nicely directed by Skip Woods.',pos
'How often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen with torrid affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never if what I see as normal life around me is anything to judge by. Romances as previously stated are hardly ever earthshaking affairs that leave you at the top of the world or batter and bruised.<br /><br />Romance in its every day form as lived out millions of times over around the world is a slow subtle and quiet affair. Something that grows in you ever so slowly probably without you even noticing it slowly taking over your being. No one can tell me when I am in love. For if someone did I would not believe him anyway for no one but me would know. And even then it is just a feeling a certain knowledge that you are feeling this exalting emotion. That you want nothing but the best for someone that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness. That you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them. I would not go so far as to say be willing to die for your loved one for we are all human and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us.<br /><br />Is the love between the main characters of the film ever so subtle and understated no less noble than that between Romeo and Juliet? The unstated emotions the unsaid feelings convey far more than any repeated shouts of I love you. The restraint shown by the lead actor displayed ever so poignantly in the scene where he watches his love interest through the cafe window yet never did he move to make himself known to her was simply heart-wrenching to watch. Would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden knowing that her emotions and feelings could not possibly be reciprocated?<br /><br />On another note how will I deal with my own certain death? While I can claim I have been seriously ill I can not in all honesty say that I have ever come close to death. Will I be so calm putting all my affairs in order and leaving instructions for others to take up what I leave behind? I suspect I will be calm for I will have little choice in the matter. Can I be so selfless? Again the answer will have to be in the negative. I can empathize with the anguish knowing that your life is forfeit that fate has dealt you a fatal blow and that future events however little there are of them left are no longer under your control.<br /><br />Life is nothing more than a series of small events the culmination of which may seem great for some in retrospect. But only very rarely.',pos
'Well its safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is one weird film! Supposedly an insight into the human mind Subconscious Cruelty is comprises four macabre and bizarre tales of the extreme. The first segment entitled Ovarian Eyeball is really just a warm up but its good in that it gives the viewer an idea of what to expect from the next three segments. It simply sees a naked woman laid out on a table while another woman cuts into her abdomen and pulls out a human eyeball! Ive got no idea what the point is but it certainly makes for visceral viewing. The following story is the best of the bunch and takes in the old favourite sick movie theme of incest. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. Hes repulsed by her pregnancy - yet he wants to have sex with her anyway and naturally he gets his way. This story stands out because of the monotonous and matter of fact narration as well as the ending - which doesnt fail to deliver the shocks. This segment is well acted well filmed and easily the highlight of Subconscious Cruelty.<br /><br />Naturally the next two sections arent as good as the second one; so the only way from there is down but director Karim Hussain still manages to pull something out of the bag before the film ends. He doesnt do it right away however as the third segment is the weakest of the film and simply sees a lot of people have sex with the ground. Its very surreal and therefore memorable for that same reason; but there doesnt seem to be a lot of point to it and I was in the mood for something a bit more morbid after the second section. The film ends on a high however as while Im not entirely sure what the point was - the final segment features the films best imagery. This segment focuses on religion and certainly isnt for anyone that values it! Director Karim Hussain has achieved something here - as while this collection of four extreme stories doesnt come together as a complete whole the film almost feels tasteful as its shot in such an eloquent and eye catching manner. The director would seem to have been imitating the highly respected surreal director Luis Buñuel albeit with gore rape and incest; and if you ask me he hasnt done a bad job at all. Not for everyone but certainly worth a look for extreme fanatics!',pos
'Some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing. Such is the case for CAROLS JOURNEY (EL VIAJE DE CAROL) a beautifully crafted 2002 film from Spain based on the novel A boca de noche by ?ngel García Roldán who also adapted the book as a screenplay. War and its consequences are not new subject matter for films but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters (especially children) who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre.<br /><br />Carol (Clara Lago) is a 12-year-old Spanish American youngster from New York who with her critically ill mother Aurora (María Barranco) returns to her Auroras home in 1938 at the height of the Spanish Civil War a home that has been left deserted by her father Don Amalio (?lvaro de Luna) since his wifes death. Carols father Robert (Ben Temple) is a fighter pilot who has sided with the Republicans against Franco and is rarely with his family. Aurora has a past: she left her lover Alfonso (Alberto Jiménez) to marry Robert and Alfonso in turn married Auroras cold sister Dolores (Lucina Gil). Carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather Don Amalio until she meets others her age but not of her class: Tomiche (Juan José Ballesta) and his two friends at first resent Carol but as events develop Carol and Tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love. When Aurora dies of her illness Carol must live with Alfonso and Dolores and their daughter Blanca (Luna McGill) yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mothers best friend and teacher Maruja (the always radiant Rosa Maria Sardà) to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side. Through a series of incidents Carol and Tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime. The ending though sad is uplifting as Carols journey to maturity is complete.<br /><br />The film is shot in Galicia and Portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer Gonzalo F. Berridi and enhanced by the musical score by Bingen Mendizábal. Director Imanol Uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war. The cast is exceptional: the stars clearly are young Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles. This is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date. Grady Harp',pos
'I have read reviews of this film that found it disappointing and confused. I am at a loss to understand why this should be so. From the beginning I found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to watch.<br /><br />Spoiler: The opening titles overlay a beautiful visual of the evolutionary process and this introduces the story with a serene and sweeping style. The film isnt about the process itself though it concerns Charles Darwins struggle with his conscience his love for his wife his deceased daughter and his search for truth.<br /><br />The appearances of his daughter are the manifestations of a tormented mind that knows it has killed God. The daughter is an adult making adult comments about his work and torturing Darwin with personal doubts. Was he in some way responsible for her death? Husband and wife in real life Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give truly wonderful performances as Charles and Emma Darwin as does Martha West as Annie. Bettanys size and awkward gait give Darwins character a genuine sense of reality whilst Connelly seems very comfortable with her English accent and occasionally somewhat severe persona.<br /><br />Its easy to misunderstand the times in which this film resides. The grip that religion had on society and the inner struggles that a man like Darwin must have endured to seek the truth in what he witnessed. Science and religion have always been awkward bedfellows and although it didnt cost him his life as it did with so many earlier men and women science put a barrier between husband and wife fact and faith. This film portrays that barrier supremely well.<br /><br />I give Creation ten stars because I think its beautiful profound superbly well acted and a genuine no-extraneous-frills-required look at one of the worlds true geniuses.<br /><br />What seems obvious to everyone today (well almost everyone... see Bill Mahers wonderful Religulous) was hidden for millennia. The truth once it was discovered was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines that pain and the realisation that we are all that we possess.<br /><br />A wonderful cinematic experience.',pos
'I must admit - the only reason I bought this movie was because I am a big fan of Gackt and a *huge* fan of Hyde. I was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were shall we say pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story. I mean the synopsis sounded really out there. And now that I have just finished watching it - I feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance! Hyde and Gackt both gave heart-wrenching performances and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie. You get sucked into the story and you really feel for the characters by the end. The element of vampirism - which I love but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with - is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic normal to this setting rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story. I ranked it at a 9 out of 10 at first...and then I went back and tried to think of why I wasnt giving it that last point. Came up with nothing. So a ten out of ten it is. After all - Im not much of a critic - the fact that Im bothering to write a review at all means I either really hate the movie or really love it. You can tell what side Im on with Moon Child.',pos

'Im fond of this film and it vexes me that so many reviewers rank it below the Peter Jackson trilogy. A filmed novel is always interpretive; in particular an animated film relies on the artists vision and should be judged on its own terms. Speaking as a purist this is a finer homage to Tolkien than the updated version. While this film has its flaws it stays truer to the source especially so far as the characters are concerned.<br /><br />In the Jackson version Tolkiens Frodo is barely recognizable: from the first scenes he is portrayed as a weakling constantly wavering manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet (this is physically and metaphorically true.) You wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the Cracks of Doom. Jackson unforgivably rewrites Tolkien and robs Frodo of his finest moment when he allows Arwen to rescue him from the Ringwraiths...Bakshis version respects the original presenting a Frodo who demands the wraiths Go back and trouble me no more! Bakshi sustains Frodos character as Tolkien conceived it. We see his decline as the weight of his burden increases. Frodo is so pivotal to Lord of the Rings you wonder why Jackson took such liberties (he does so with numerous characters)since character development propels the plot to its inevitable conclusion. Bakshis film better explores the companionship between Legolas and Gimli in a few judicious scenes that are completely lacking in Jacksons version. Similarly we see Boromir horsing with Pippin and Merry furthering the idea of fellowship. For my liking the camaraderie is more developed in the animated version than the live action.<br /><br />Tolkiens poetry is an important ingredient in the novels and Bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes: when Frodo sings the Merry Old Inn song minutes before stumbling into Strider. The cheery tune is chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later invisible to his friends but visible to the wraiths Frodo is dangerously exposed. This is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever I see it.<br /><br />The well documented budget/time restrictions limit this films final impact but had it been completed it may have resonated with more viewers. As it is its worth a look. Even its detractors admit that Peter Jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype.',pos
'At first I didnt didnt like it that much although I did. They didnt include the third Trueba generation the love between Blanca and Pedro wanst well explained and some actors were too different from what I had imagined.<br /><br />Later I realized that had the movie been more loyal to the book it would have been like five hours long and would be kind of tedious. Now I like it very much because my favourite characters are there as I portraited them. Clara really looks like an Angel in live and her introduction to the story at the beggining of the film was fantastic loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I pictured her just like that only not in mourning throughout the whole thing. Esteban is find enough. I never really liked his character and although I was interested in him I hated him a lot more specially when he hit Clara. As in the book the very last part is the most exciting one and it has real history too there.<br /><br />The movie is really good specially considering that it was a gringo film based upon a latin american book.

How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? Were talking Oscar winner turf here. It had good special effects. It even had some really good tits! And I mean nicely shown full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver. But it didnt compensate for the one missing ingredient - a story! The plot was ludicrous. I dont mean the solar crisis sun exploding stuff but that was bad enough. It was the rest of the stuff - the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff. Man that just STANK! No amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that one.<br /><br />I have seen the same cast members be incredibly good. I have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets. All the difference is in the writing.',neg
'I was raised in a very Christian household since birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church. This movie was highly disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years. I used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my moms footsteps upstairs. If I didnt hear her footsteps I would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadnt been raptured. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I was terrified of Jesus forgetting me. This is definitely not something I will show to my kids until they are much older if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.',neg

I found that at the end of any episode I watched; I walked away having been both entertained and informed. I am actually dumber now that Hack is gone. I no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate. Since Hack has been gone I see them as eyesores and an unneeded strain on taxpayers. So for the love of God we need to bring back Hack!',pos

'Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director but he has made some undeniably important films. Kids Bully and to a lesser extent Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose: shock revulsion and even disgust. These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. Kids exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young. Bully touched upon similar issues. Ken Park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui. Irrefutably all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Hispanic skateboarders from South-Central Las Angeles who go to arbitrarily go to Beverly Hills to skate. Thats it.<br /><br />Wassup Rockers is nothing.<br /><br />It has no substance. It has an essentially nonexistent narrative. And like Kids it features a cast of first-time actors who were drawn out of the films setting. However unlike Kids none of them have any semblance of talent. There is better acting in porn. This film features without a doubt the most terrible performances Ive ever seen in a feature film. One can respect Larry Clark to exposing these young men to the film-making process but these kids are absolutely cringe-worthy folks. Might I add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk youll ever hear- my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater or youll regret it afterward.<br /><br />But then again its not like they had much of a script to work with. Every line that is uttered is a contrived pathetically-delivered and irritating beyond all measure. The story itself is ludicrous. It starts out reasonably enough but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity. This begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls followed by a series of clichéd National Lampoonish encounters characters being killed off for no reason and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti-climax. Shots go on much longer than they need to. Be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight overlong lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets. But then again with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible. Perhaps Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film.<br /><br />Anyways I could go on like this. This is the worst film Larry Clark has made yet. For those of you who are interested in seeing a Clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics look elsewhere. This is by far the tamest film hes made yet and its also the worst. Its flat out horrible. Like Uwe Boll horrible. Definitely the worst one I saw at the festival.<br /><br />1/10',neg

'THE MATADOR is hit-man movie lite....if you can say that about a hit-man movie. The violence is never really shown but often introduced. At first I was scared I was in for another retread of mid-90s gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy BUT was happily surprised when I realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship. Nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning. The three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together. The writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes. This is a good film that I probably wont remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy. Good film.',pos
'Genre: Dinosaur animation New York time travel circus.?<br /><br />Main characters: Rex the Tyrannosaurus rex Elsa the pterodactyl Dweeb the Parasarolophus Ooo the Triceratops a boy called Louis a girl called Cecilia and Captain New-eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex) Yeardley Smith (Cecilia) Martin Short (Stubbs the clown) Felicity Kendal (Elsa) etc.?<br /><br />What happens: Four dinosaurs (see above) are fed some brain grain cereal and are now cuddly friendly dinosaurs who are going to be nice to children. They go into New York with big plans<br /><br />My thoughts: This is a cute animated film. The animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and not-so-good but they look pleasant all the same that way. I like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly they are nice friendly and good. I like (almost) all the characters featured especially Elsa and Cecilia but of course I like the others as well. Overall I like this film a lot! :-)<br /><br />Recommended to: People who like good childrens animated films people who like dinosaurs John Goodman and people who think that circuses arent always what they seem Enjoy! :-)',pos
'Who Will Love My Children Saddest movie I have ever seen. Definite 10/10. Released on TV in 1983. Movie has been released on VHS. DVD release is a must sooner rather than later. Mother dying of cancer must find homes for all her children before she dies because her thoughts are that her husband and father of the kids is not capable of caring for them once she has died. She manages to find homes for the children except one a young boy whom is not wanted because he suffers from epilepsy. Very sad when your not wanted. In for a real good tear jerker get your hands on this movie. Im a male even I cried when I watched this movie. Not to be missed.',pos
'Notwithstanding that The House of Adam is meant to be a mainstream gay movie; that Anthony (John Shaw) who is gay curious and a major cutie-hunk and Adam (Jared Cadwell) who is openly gay and a close second in looks; that there is a whole minute of wonderful convincing and naked lovemaking (sorry no frontal) between Anthony and Adam 41 minutes into the movie (that alone may be sufficient for many of us) --- notwithstanding all that (to which I give a thumbs up) The House of Adam is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard. A big thumbs down.<br /><br />Shaws and Cadwells acting abilities are either sophomoric or else truly suffer from the bad script direction and editing or rather the lack thereof. Their lovemaking scene is nevertheless convincing and may have more to do with their really being into each other considering the rest of their scripting and acting.<br /><br />Writer-director Jorge Amers (Bonus Feature) self-congratulation as to his movie making skills is off the wall.<br /><br />So the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down. Overall the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for Shaw and Cadwell. Alexis Karriker as Nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above. Far and away the absolute worst and insufferable acting was by Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross Anthonys father having not even of elementary school acting quality. He truly represents a colossal casting failure.<br /><br />The actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as well.<br /><br />If only the production editing and post production were as good as the trailer this movie would have been quite something else. The trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place. That and the hope that this gay-centered movie was supposedly prominently played and touted at gay film festivals.<br /><br />Overall the movie is a big thumbs down.<br /><br />Is it worth buying/renting and watching it? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love making scene and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies.',neg
'MASTER PLAN: have the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous Enter the Dragon from 73 this one is an effort from South Africa. The villains stronghold is a bit different appearing as a white castle-like fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance. The villain himself a Baron or general is a slightly more perverse version of the Dr.No or Han mold of master villainy having strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany. He does wear the full regalia Nazi uniform at some points. His main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition/tournament against his Japanese rival an extension of their complicity in the 2nd World War (my army is better than your army). It sounds silly and it is though the suggestion of madness and crazed machismo almost works. The central hero Steve Chase (Ryan) resembles a white Bruce Lee character having a similarly lean lithe physique though obviously not on the same level of martial arts expertise. I thought he would be some secret government agent here but apparently not. He and his girlfriend have joined the Barons team of fighters but decide to quit (what did they think they were getting into?). Of course its not that easy. Theres an odd sequence of them escaping through the desert using a wrecked car with a rigged sail - those desert winds can do wonders for travel it seems.<br /><br />The plot kind of meanders in the 2nd half as the hero joins the team of the villains competitor and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell under threat of rape by the heros rival. The most interesting character turns out to be Chico a dwarf who is the villains assistant; hes loyal to the Baron but is sympathetic to the plight of the hero. Much of the fighting utilizes the ballet-like capabilities of the hero with a lot of leaping and slow motion. The sound FX are also amped up and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the blows. There are a few good fights during the tournament towards the climax but none really stand out. If one had to pick I suppose the best involves the brutish muscle man-henchman of the Baron introduced late in the story (he lifts the back of a car at one point). You wonder how the hero will take him out at the end since the brute seems to shrug off most of the punches. The acting is very mediocre descending into camp as far as the girlfriend who tends to laugh for no reason as if shes high on grass though she is very cute. Some of the training scenes are also campy especially all those guys running over or rolling down the desert sands. And with such a title theres surprisingly few actual killings. Ryan as Steve Chase returned as a traditional agent in the sequel Kill and Kill Again.

'I just got done watching The Edge of Love (by the way this is one of the worst titles so far this year) and it felt like a chore. Watching Keira Knightlys unlikable skeleton-looking character made me cringe even more throughout the coarse of the film.<br /><br />It took me four nights to watch this it was so boring. The only good thing about it was Cillian Murphy. Hes always good/believable and is severely under looked in many films. This however was just not good enough for him.<br /><br />Apart from the unlikable characters boring storyline the plot was also emotionally unsatisfying. I felt like I spent my time watching this for nothing (which I did). I should have done the smart thing and turned it off but I kept it on out of respect for Cillian Murphy and the great cinematography.',neg
'Oscar-caliber performance by Peter Falk in an Oscar-caliber-written role. I loved the nuanced balanced exploration of a long-time marriage - how often do we get that in films where usually the movie ends when boy & girl get together? This is a movie for adults a complex view through the eyes of all parties - husband wife son - how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story. On top of that it gave me about 10 major belly laughs and Im one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing. This was one of the few truly funny movies Ive seen. Great original jokes.',pos
'Closet Land tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements. You could read lots of stuff about the movies plot before hand but you dont really need to. All you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation. Along the way we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated. We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. Especially when you have absolutely no control over it.<br /><br />In the end the movie amounts to a warning (really though the movie has several different aspects to it) about what happens to peoples freedoms when they look the other way and ignore injustices happening to those around them.<br /><br />If youve got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this I strongly recommend that you do so.',pos
'I remember reading all the horrible horrible reviews for this film when it came out. I meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks. The only other movie to manage that is Gigli. <br /><br />When the movie came out on DVD I bought it to see how awful it was. I couldnt think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible. After seeing it I can understand. <br /><br />First off let me say that this film is not without some cool shots. Theres a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun which I thought was neat. And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /><br />Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad acting was a sin then Hell wouldve chucked Tara Reid right out since shes so unbelievably awful in this movie its unthinkable. And of all the roles she plays a curator. Now if she played a dumb empty- headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character. Apparently Uwe Boll didnt realize that although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie people would see it. He just didnt realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad. And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping? I couldnt tell. <br /><br />Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills youll ever see in a movie. I mean Id give House of the Dead an F (and I only do that for very few movies) but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk. The movie starts off with a very very long narration that causes immediate confusion (and read by a horrible narrator) and from there the cuts are really really dumb. Theres this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building thats been destroyed and the screen blackens out. When it comes back Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly an entire army has joined them. Huh? <br /><br />And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie. At one point a team breaks through glass but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reids earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead comrade you can see her begin to get up. <br /><br />As for the story... I was really lost. Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone opens the path or something and all the evil monsters pop out. Its just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film) that get quite simply BORING. <br /><br />I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I didnt laugh but I still think its stupid. Very very very stupid.',neg
'This movie is a must-see movie for all. Congress should see this truthful documentary from the point-of-view of the soldier as should everyone in America. The previous reviewer totally missed the point--the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists but who just live in our enemys territory and what it does to the soldiers. We must support our troops by bringing them home IMMEDIATELY before another person is killed or injured.

'Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and dabble in horror. The result Dead Above Ground is an abysmal piece of junk. Now had I noticed his name in association with THIS particular film Id have put it back but no I didnt have my glasses on and therefore I missed it damn I really do need to bring those with me while video shopping. First question would be who the heck is the target audience for this? Its almost like a scary kids movie but then again theres topless babes and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone anyone go after them with farm implements of SOME kind. Seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past a child-murdering witch that collected childrens teeth lived there. Probably something the real estate agent failed to mention. Of course now in the modern day theres a little girls ghost around to warn the real-live little girl that now lives there that something bad is going to happen. It does and theres also two Bubbas that were squatting on that property when the new owner took over so theyre out for revenge too. This whole thing has the feel of some made-for-cable junk thats for the kids at Halloween except for of course the things that arent suitable for little kids so not only is this mediocre its confused too. A big boo and hiss to Anchor Bay for putting this out too considering their usual track record with fine releases this is a new low. The UK gets a Phantasm Box Set we get The Tooth Fairy.

'Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub-par performances phoned-in by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr. and will perhaps be utterly perplexed by Bodrov Sr.s hackneyed and confusing script which is coupled with uncharacteristically weak direction. Most of the characters wander through the movie as though they have no idea who they are or what they are doing. It is also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leighs acting skills have not advanced one iota since FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and her screen exposure is mercifully limited. This is a terrible mafia movie; so much so that it makes the GODFATHER III look like a winner in the genre. To see the key Russians at their best check out Bodrov Sr.s work on PRISONER OF THE MOUNTAINS (which also features Jr.) Mashkovs turn in VOR (THE THIEF) and Bodrov Jr.s new criminal in BRAT.',neg

And this went on and on. If Mr. McElwees family had prevailed over the Dukes I doubt that Mr. McElwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where Mr. McElwees family began it tobacco business ; I expected more than McEwees continual focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the ramifications to the states economy by tighter regulation of tobacco. The countless references to the movie Bright Leaves are out of place - So what if Gary Cooper played Mr. McElwees great grandfather? Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film? I didnt.',neg

It was young love that engrossed me the most not to mention Johns vocals and Taupins lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.

'I am willing to tolerate almost anything in a Sci-Fi movie but this was almost intolerable. While a few of the special effects are very cool (landscapes) this is no battlespace rather a disjointed weird mother/daughter relationship with sci-fi concepts thrown in. The acting (wooden) framing and shooting (kindergarten film school) and with hand-to-hand combat scenes funnier than any Hong Kong chopsocky movie this film bores. The plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along (narrator) unexplained scene jumps and plenty of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea.

'One of the those coming of age films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids. This movie has neither. It is a poor excuse to let Sylvia Kristels body double frolic with a dorky Eric Brown. To make matters worse the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny sexy or dramatic. Laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard. Ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a body double. As the movie went on and on I started to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions that had Sylvia Kristel seduce Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic for WKRP. Watch this to laugh at other peoples stupidity or for Ed Begley Jr.s committed performance or to wonder what Sylvia Kristel would look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt.

'This film which I rented under the title Black Voodoo should be avoided. I was expecting a blaxploitation/horror flick; but what I got was a very dull standard ghost extracts vegence. In this case the ghost was that of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment but whos plea was ignored and he died in an operation. The result: his spirit posesses Nurse Sherry and forces her to commit acts of murder. The only voodoo connection was to one of the three black characters in this case a blinded ex-football player whos mom practiced voodoo. The film is very slow and very dull. There is a very standard ending that provides on excitement followed by a horrificly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER)<br /><br />In which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she was possessed. This movie is slow and bad in a non-funny just stupefying way. Avoid it at all costs.',neg
'Super-slick entertainment with a stellar cast an outstanding script and a firm grip on the approaching 1950s. At the time RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens. But whatever the value of those shadowy downers they reflected a war-time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the Eisenhower era. Few films of the late-40s are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy.<br /><br />Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) works as an ad-man on Madison Ave. where in his little daughters words-- he sells things to people that they dont need at prices they cant afford. Hes making good money but like thousands of others hes tired of living in a cramped urban cave. So with wife Myrnah Loy they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the Connecticutt countryside. Needless to say in the arms of nature they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion.<br /><br />Theres hardly a lifeless line in the entire script. I dont know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar but they should have. Of course the humor revolves around all the problems that pop-up when city people build a big house on rural land. The annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving Grant a hard time. Of course no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than Grant so its just one well-placed laugh after another particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own. Yet oddly the film appears to have no comedic high-point. Instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they dont peak at any particular point. Thats a real movie triumph for any era.<br /><br />Reaching back 60 years later we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind. With their live-in maid the Blandings may not be a typical American family but that post-war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical. And what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than Blandings as an ad-man tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more ham. More than anything however theres the movies sunny optimism. Oh sure the feeling falters at times yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the Blandings just stick to their dream carries them through. Indeed life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge so I expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day. Its that easily over-looked subtext along with the sheer entertainment value that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post-war period.<br /><br />So if you havent seen it catch it next time around.',pos
'you cant take it realistically. -sheets<br /><br />Zombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a world all of its own. Ive really never seen anything like it. The only thing I can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs. Forgive the clichéI dont simply mean that its incoherent and absurd though occasionally it is. I mean that it takes you through such a broad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you and when its over you find that its all happened while you were sitting on the couch.<br /><br />It is worth noting that its extremely low-budget as a disclaimer to those who after seeing Shaun of the Dead consider themselves fans of underground zombie films. Also of note is that it is much more brutal than youd expect. Children get disemboweled and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin. Her corpse is subsequently raped. These are certainly not flaws and indeed I feel it is to the films credit. But if it doesnt sound like your kind of movie dont waste your time.<br /><br />(I dont mean to over-hype it regarding brutality. Dont go in expecting Inside or something.) I hesitate to give away any of the plot because its really full of surprises. Even the opening scene which has nothing to do with zombies is at once a classic horror scene and something quite original.<br /><br />Man Im three paragraphs in and Ive hardly said anything at all. Heres why I thought the movie was awesome: 1. Its big and it keeps moving. At one point you expect it to turn into another NotLD clone a board-up-the-windows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with one another. By the end of the film however the farmhouse scenes will seem like a distant dream. There are also a number of outdoor urban scenes. These are rare in low-budget zombie films.<br /><br />2. The makeup/gore is much better than ZB1. More convincing and more creative. Something kind of funny: the early zombies look really lame. Then halfway through they suddenly look really good with prosthetics and everything. Some of them look like Fulci zombies some are reminiscent of Mr. Tongue from Day of the Dead. And its got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around. Never gets old.<br /><br />3. Theres something oddly emotional about it. One character asserts that heaven exists and that our dead/undead protagonists are now in heaven. In the context of the film we believe it to be true. Though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity they genuinely seem to care about each other and accordingly I found myself caring about them.<br /><br />4. The pacing is great. Theres hardly a dull moment.<br /><br />My only observation that borders on criticism is that Todd Sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog Ive ever heard. I personally feel it adds to the experience but I dont think he does it on purpose so I cant fairly give the film a perfect rating. (Example: when a car breaks down the owner yells at the passengers. Then he says something to the effect of Sorry I yelled at you guys. You dont know what its like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when youre five years old. wtf?) At the very end it gets to be more than I can handle. Involves a montage with Bill Clinton and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor. Really by this point I was firmly re-living my drug experiences.<br /><br />Highly recommended. 7/10.',pos
'...scratch it. Just as Africans created rhythms with the jawbone of an ass and Virgin Islanders welded oil drums into ear pleasing steel bands so did urban DJs itch to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. Scratch is a wholly unnarrated documentary which will take you to the heart of the hip-hop/rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism the art of scratching vinyl and the ultimate DJ/MC contempo entertainment expression.

'The alternate title of Ecstasy is Symphony of Love; a title which appropriately describes the mood and feel of the film. Ecstasy is an early talkie and could have very well been a classic film if released during the silent film era. This film is a visual treat and is deliberately paced so the viewer can savour its sensuous lyric quality which is presented in an artistic low-key fashion. The directors style is distinctly European. The subject matter and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated than what was being produced in Hollywood at that time. Consider the censorship code in the US during the 30s that pretty much sums it up. Hedy Lamarr one of the great beauties of all time was a perfect choice for this Symphony of Love.',pos
'This movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes Nicholas Sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as The Notebook but whats sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in McAdams and Gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of Channing Tatum<br /><br />I felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he cant act leaving an awkward and uneven situation Amanda Seyfried given a great performance only to have Tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene cant recover.<br /><br />This story deserved to be cast right but what it got was a pretty boy who cant act. Tatum should stick to what hes good at movies that are more about his physical ability albeit horrible like GI JOE step up and Fighting. The less he talks the better.<br /><br />Try not to think of me as a jaded hater of Channing Tatum I went in to this movie with an open mind because Ive been surprised many a time by the likes of Adam Sandler in Reign over Me. I gave the same chance to Tatum I didnt view him here as the sum of his past roles purely just by his performance in this movie which sadly was a letdown',neg
'Horses on Mars is an engaging animated short that takes a sometimes comical look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those yet to evolve. The story is personal and at times sentimental and is supported by strong digital animation and narration that involves the viewer in this science fiction story. I was fortunate enough to view this short in widescreen format at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival and must suppose that when transferred to the small screen it will lose some of its ability to draw the reader into the no less thoughtful story and stunning graphics.',pos
'Stylish thought provoking cool and gripping  just four aspects of a film that will long remain in the thoughts of this viewer.<br /><br />Slow-paced it may be at the beginning but the director beguiles with beautiful camera work sophisticated compositions and elegant editing. The unfolding of the story not so much the narrative line but the revelation of the characters inner selves is masterful.<br /><br />Olivia Magnani who plays Sophia the hotel receptionist who finally breaks down the icy reserve of former consiglierie Titta di Girolami (Tony Servillo) is coolly beautiful and reveals hidden depths and personal honesty in her brief but profound relationship with Girolami.<br /><br />The disgraced Mafia middle-man forced to live out an empty life tormented by insomnia in a Swiss hotel becomes caught up in the similarly empty lives of the refined older couple who formerly owned the hotel but are now forced to live there as residents after the husband gambled away their resources years earlier. The husband is constantly dreaming about recovering his lost wealth and making a grand statement to the world. His wife realises this is but a pipe dream. This nicely counterpoints the resignation of Girolami who sees no way out and does not seek one.<br /><br />The fleeting love affair between Girolami and Sophia has consequences that no one could have foreseen. It enables him to escape his prison without bars but to pay a huge price that he willingly accepts and in doing so provides redemption for the older couple.',pos
'Ive had this movie on tape for years and started watching it again this morning (while waiting for my laundry --- how ironic!) mostly because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frankels title music again. I ended up sitting through about the first half hour entranced by how wonderfully assured the direction writing and performances are. The movie is like a whos who of 50s British character stars: Cecil Parker Michael Gough Miles Malleson Duncan Lamont and particularly Ernest Thesiger great as the dessicated old giant of the textile mills. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood not character players as such but charming charismatic leads. This is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well. An all-time classic and I hope no one ever tries to remake it!',pos
'Are we serious??? I mean wow ... just wow. I think I saw this flick in an old issue of War Journal. This is pathetic originality is completely dead instead of trying to formulate a new idea what we receive is a bland re-do of an old plot line and to switch it up we just change the gender or race of the original character its moronic and everyone should be sick and tired of seeing it ... but I guess this is just a rant and will most likely fall on deaf ears to engrossed with the sound of another turd hitting the toilet water like the best western since 3:10 to Yuma ... (wait for it)... 3:10 to Yuma! Thank You Hollywood for killing film as an art form and turning it into a commercial barrage of neo-pop junk and blatant retardation ... wonderful!!!',neg
'I absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film. The humor seems to be destined for corpses. Its slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not raise much sympathy a few non-important characters aside. Nothing surprising happens. What did the writers of this script think? Oooo funny! Lets make some old ladys high on pot! Lets make them.... giggle! Lets make them... behave like little children!! Oooo yes thats absolutely brilliant and original!<br /><br />This film has irritated me most from all the films Ive seen in the last five years.',neg
'Although I havent seen it yet I know that Chaplin is a genius and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter--a comedy about Hitler. All great satire is based on going out on an edge. Also all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos. This film seems like it will skirt both sides. Like Kubricks Dr. Strangelove The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. And hopefully through laughter we can learn to view the world in a new light. Another film that does this that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturicas Underground and Fando And Lis. So let me watch the film first.',pos
'The book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life. But saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement. The acting directing cinematography and storyline were all horrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Ive told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie! I did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly but they have left out too many key components of the book. The movie tried but failed to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only demeaned the central theme of the prophecy. While putting myself in the position who had not read the book I saw the Celestine Prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy B.S. I am thoroughly disappointed with Redfield for the way this movie turned out.',neg
'I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (12 Sept 2009). I am 61 years old and have been watching films as long as I can remember. I can truthfully say that Brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film I have ever seen. The accents were shameful. The local childrens club would have produced better sets. The characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them. It is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film. The owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film.',neg
'This has to be one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to see. The general idea of a coronal mass ejection hitting the planet earth with EM disruption is fair enough but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a sustained 155ºF? The acting was so terrible I got the feeling that the casting agents simply grabbed a handful of people off of Santa Monica Boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. In all honesty I have seen less wooden acting from my ironing board. Sorry but this film was poor poor poor.',neg
'The filmmakers neglected to connect the dots--that is the sequence of events and choices that led from Charlie Wilson and the anti-Soviet mujaheddin to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden and eventually to 9/11. The filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the back-story--why were the Soviets in Afghanistan?--but that omission pales in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for Islamicist extremists in Afghanistan in the name of rabid anti-communism ultimately strengthened the hand of anti-western forces and was a big contributing factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today (9/11 terrorist networks a prolonged ground war in Afghanistan etc.). Because these consequences are not spelled out the movie leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to Mr. Wilson (hey check out his latest projects on the Internet) instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the West as a whole.',neg
'So-so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip out west. The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitts a serial killer on the lam (unbeknownst to Dave) and Juliette is his poor not-all-there companion. This is a good cast and the story moves along but Pitt isnt belivably scary as a serial killer although it is one of his better earlier roles. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes who always manages to shine whether in her roles on `Homicide: Life on the Street or in the brief series `Wonderland.<br /><br />Vote: 6',pos

'Its 1982 Two years after the Iranian Embassy Siege which involved the dramatic SAS Rescue from the Balconys and with a War with Argentina over the Falkland Islands currently taking place what better film to make than a Gung-Ho SAS Film that re-creates the Iranian Hostage siege whilst using Britains Number one action hero of the day Lewis Collins. throw in Edward Woodward and a few other Well known actors and youve got a winner on your hands?...Well maybe not! The film itself doesnt make the situation serious enough whilst the acting is quite second rate. its like a Movie long episode of The Professionals but without the formula. This film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch Lewis Collins as a Touted James Bond Replacement for Roger Moore. Watch it if your a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS stuff in General if not save your time.',neg
'My personal favorite horror film. From the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist this is Carpenters masterpiece.<br /><br />Halloween night 1963 little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978 Michael escapes from Smiths Grove sanitarium. Halloween night Michael has come home to murder again.<br /><br />The story is perfectly simple Michael stalks and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles just the basics. Its Carpenters almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. Like any great horror film events are telegraphed long in advance yet they still seem to occur at random never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film.<br /><br />The dark lighting the long steady-cam shots and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in film. There is a body count but compared to the slew of slashers after this its fairly small. That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. The fear is not in death but in not knowing.<br /><br />The acting is roundelay good. PJ Soles provides much of the films limited humor (and one of the best deaths) Nancy Loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first seems shy and un-assured yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character who is herself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face. And of course there is the perfectly cast Donald Pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence.<br /><br />If the film has a detrimental flaw it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones copies rip-offs and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar. Combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites one finds much of the films raw power diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and age it must be viewed as it once was as something unique.<br /><br />Never the less I have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good scary time. Highest Reguards.<br /><br />10/10',pos
'This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny entertaining sweet and memorable its difficult to decide where to start.<br /><br />From the opening number Rainbow Connection Paul Williamss excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about throughout the story this is one fun movie.<br /><br />Essentially its a road trip movie where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain. Along the way our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors comedians singers and musicians who coincidentally are muppets like Kermit himself. Is this how the Muppets really started? Approximately how it happened Kermit tells us.<br /><br />Not since Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World has the cameo formula been used so prolifically and successfully. The aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some just blink across the screen but others have very memorable cameos. Steve Martins amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best. Puppeteer Jim Hensons nod to his inspiration Edgar Bergen is especially touching.<br /><br />Anyone who ever watched the Muppets TV show will get to see all of their favorite characters theyre all here. The puppetry work is magnificent; look especially for Kermit riding a bicycle (how dey do dat???) In-jokes and references to old movies are everywhere but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit himself. An example: when the crooks are terrorizing Kermit and Piggy she affectionately says to her short green and handsome beau I wouldnt give up this evening together for anything would you? Uhhh make me an offer.... I also love the gunfight at the OK Corral scene: brilliantly absurd silliness.<br /><br />Gotta get Movin right along now but to summarize: a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age or movie genre taste. Highly recommended.',pos
'Fear and Desire is of interest mainly to Kubrick obsessives who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still-to-come greatness. Kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video. He considered it embarrassing and amateurish and he was correct in his evaluation. This is a weak and tedious film--at 68 minutes it still seems longer than Barry Lyndon!--it nevertheless is of historical interest and has its genuine absorbing moments. Its a difficult film to find (only unofficial copies are in circulation) though perhaps this may change if Kubricks estate relents and has it released on video. Recommended only for Kubrick enthusiasts.',neg
'Having read the books and seen the 1982 Anthony Andrews/Jane<br /><br />Seymour version I have to say that this is not good at all.<br /><br />According to the books Percy is supposed to be a seemingly<br /><br />foppish aristocrat when hes being Percy and witty and clever<br /><br />when hes being the Pimpernel but here he just looks bored as<br /><br />Percy and mean as the Pimpernel. Marguerite is supposed to be<br /><br />the most beautiful woman in Europe not a tired and frumpy-looking matron (she looks middle-aged probably due to<br /><br />bad make-up). Richard E. Grant has done much better things and<br /><br />Elizabeth McGoverns acting is uninspired and flat. The wit and<br /><br />dash of the books and the Andrews/Seymour film is here replaced<br /><br />by brawn and flashy editing that just dont make the cut. <br /><br /> I might add that to a person who hasnt seen any previous version<br /><br />or read the book it would probably look ok.',neg
'Being a Film studies graduate I would like to think that I have seen a diverse range of films some good and some bad but I would have to say that Summer rain is by far the worse film I have ever seen! I chose the film in the hope that it was going to be a great British classic such as Secrets and Lies or Lockstock but oh no this was so bad that my flat mates and I ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script (reminded me of a bad theatre in education school production). The main characters Michelle and Gary began to annoy us from the start. Michelle the main character who lives with her two friends has the type of face that you would never get tired of slapping and Gary was so wet (he kept breaking down in tears every 5 minutes) that by the end of the film I really didnt give a damn about either of them. All I could think was  I paid £3 for this pile. I have never written a review before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production. So please avoid at all costs. Thanks for reading.',neg
'THE MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who develops a crush on a 17-year old neighbor (Jason London) who ends up falling for her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters this familys dynamics forever. The 1950s are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately. Witherspoon already begins to show the Oscar-winning talent she would develop in this early role and London makes a charming leading man. Warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls parents and Gail Strickland who plays Londons mom. I was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase family ties.',pos
'!!!!! OF COURSE THERES SPOILERS !!!!! Im sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies: Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check Heorine knocks out villain - Check Heroine doesnt notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class . Dear oh dear if only London transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here . In fact theres so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long hes been killing people on the underground . Im led to believe its the result of some human experiment and perhaps its not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless Not to be totally negative I doubt very much if the producers thought theyd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and theres always a market for horror movies . Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution and I will state that its slightly better than 1972s DEATH LINE which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the London underground . its just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head',neg
'Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja-growing in order to pay the bills. It sounds promising and the ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn doesnt disappoint but the material is sitcom-thin. Theres actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to Give me one (a toke) and he thinks shes asking for sex and acts all awkward. Yes its humour so twee a nun would be bored. Saving Grace doesnt seem to know what it wants to be: the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of Ryans Daughter whilst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of Antiques Roadshow. It does speed up after the first hour but by then its too clichéd to care. The climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina Ive ever seen.',neg

'I dont understand the humor in this film. I also found it offensive on how Koreans were depicted in that film despite how it is actually just a caricature of Koreans in those areas. First the actors are Japanese and they make the most rude expressions of Koreans in that film. It disgusts me on how these people are expressed. I felt anger just watching that one scene and how they were so badly made out in the film. The humor lasts just for one laugh and then you dont understand why its even funny. Its crude humor with the most disgusting representation of society there. I found it to be an offensive film overall... Maybe it was just because I never lived in the hood or saw any hood movies but I dont intend to either.',neg
'When a movie called Hell Ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché. With character names like Pistolero Comanche and The Gent I braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that. The dialogue soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. Dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while CC Rider plays and they talk about sex and violence. Yawn! The three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable. Seeing old men like Bishop and Madsen (in a freaking ruffled shirt) riding down a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men trying desperately to relive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour tried his best but with such poor material it got lost. Even an appearance by Dennis Hopper in full Easy Rider swing couldnt save it. And lets talk about the store bought tans shall we? Many have compared this to Tarantinos work. It is not even close. What makes Tarantinos work so brilliant is he knows its over the top so he just goes balls out and takes it as far over the top as possible. Bishop took this film so seriously that it became nothing more than a poor copy of the exploitation genre.',neg

I did used to like this show when I was 4 and 5 I still only watched it when there was nothing on. Now I am other 5 and I would rather do my homework than watch it. The cartoon used to be a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing. Now I am older I am interested in show witch are not rated Us. I have started to watch Doctor Who (12A) Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I am interested in things to do with Doctor Who so I am not interested in 5 year old cartoons. This cartoon didnt last very long it only had 6 seasons it got cancelled because of it was low on viewers but some people say it was because the writers ran out of ideas but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons.',neg
'From all the bad comments about this movie and add them up I feel the same way. It may look like the Australians are weaklings instead they were brave soldiers. In this film it was very terrible and too graphic. I didnt see enough heroism just more cowardice which is ashame because its nothing from what I read. We dont need the extremity of violence like that we can use our vivid imagination of what they went through. Its like saving private ryan where the nazi is pushing his knife slowly in the soldier. For example Mel Gibson is a over extreme director for his movies not because of the violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy. Letters of Iwo Jima was one of the war films that was close enough to history (although I could be wrong) except Flags of our Fathers and Bridge of the River Kwai. Youre better off reading it its an insult to the victims and the fallen if you dont tell it right and the movie drag on for too long there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the aussies to kill Japanese soldiers. Just read history on the internet mags and in books. Movies always kill the sense of realization. What they did to POWs in Singapore and the Philippines was just dreadful escpically to civilians. It just makes me feel proud to see goodies beat the baddies but movies like this ruin it.',neg
'High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against Coach George Michaels(Christopher George playing him as a major butt-head who is VERY demanding of the athletes under his watch). Hell be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer. Some twisted psychopath in sweats(much the same as what Michaels is often seen wearing) using a stop watch to time his executions murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of. Soon disturbed parents call Principal Guglione(Michael Pataki)wondering why their children didnt come home after a prom party. Inspector Halliday(Carmen Argenziano)begins snooping around campus at worried parents request. Instantly a beleaguered Michaels becomes a prime suspect after the body of a gymnast is found in a locker. Ensign Anne(Patch Mackenzie)returned home from her base in Guam to receive her dead track sisters diploma and soon confronts the killer herself in the climactic chase scene. Kevin Badger(E Danny Murphy)is the weary boyfriend of the lost track star.<br /><br />Rather leisurely paced slasher spreads out the death sequences quite a bit trying to mix humor within and rather failing miserably. Low-quality kill sequences only increase the laughter such as a sword embedded within a football thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to behead a poor soul taking a leak. Linnea Quigley has an amusing role as horny student Dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always chases after a male stud(the recipient of the garden shears before he has a chance to bed Dolores outside of the prom party). Vanna White has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the dead gymnasts body in the locker. Virgil Frye has a silly role as an inept officer.',neg
'I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I actually had high hopes watching this last night on DVD. Mainly as I try to avoid reviews until I watch something myself and form my own opinion Big mistake! My 2 /10 is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone it may have risen above the 5/10 mark.Once it moved into TV reality show territory it stank to high heaven. Ryan Reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay TV writer and famous games creator / devoted family man he was definitely less effective. From the blurb on the box I expected a flashback thriller along the lines of Memento - unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie.',neg

'The best film on the battle of San Antonio Texas in March 1836 was John Waynes 1960 epic THE ALAMO. In a one shot job as director producer that temporarily financially strapped him Wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon-like acting ability personifying the West.<br /><br />I have commented on that film in a review the other night and I pointed out that Wayne and James Edward Grant (the screenwriter) tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle. They did bring in the issue of slavery. They also finally discussed the contribution of local Mexican land owner Juan Seguin as an important leader in the War for Independence on par with Crockett Bowie Travis Austin and Houston. <br /><br />But there was one weakness (though well hidden) in the film. Wayne worked hard to cast it properly thinking of many people for lead roles in it. But he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces General Antonio De Santa Anna. The role was played by an obscure actor Ruben Padilla (on this board his thread shows only three credits listed). Padilla did not have any spoken dialog (even in Spanish). And while he does have one of the last shots in the film he just is shown as a silent tyrant observing the burning of the bodies of the Americans and their allies.<br /><br />Despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie (THE ALAMO: THIRTEEN DAYS TO CLORY) it is the best film in showing the man who was (from 1836 to 1854) a leading bogeyman to American policy makers. Raul Julia was a wonderful stage actor. I was fortunate to see him in a production (in the late 1980s) of ARMS AND THE MAN in Manhattan as Sergius. He was never boring and usually first rate in his acting.<br /><br />Here we see the egotistical monster at his worst. Nothing is acceptable that does not fit Santa Annas wishes or activities. It can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough or it can be the temerity of these foreign brigands (as he saw the Americans) in not knuckling down to himself the Napoleon of the West.<br /><br />Santa Anna was President of Mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855. He claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a President because that President did not live up to the countrys constitution but it was the power that kept him going year after year. It is a sad commentary that he was the leading Mexican historical figure in those two decades. No political figure or military figure would rise to override him until Benito Juarez did in the late 1850s. Initially he claimed great liberal ideals but he once admitted that the people of Mexico were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves (and thus he sounds like Gilbert Roland in CRISIS talking about the people he has helped lead against Jose Ferrer). The amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back. His policies were disasters. While we know about his attack on Texas (to put down a revolt there) he also tried to expand into Guatamala (and probably saw himself controlling much of Central America). He did win at the Alamo but at great cost of lives. His massacre of Col. Fannins men at Goliad was inexcusable (one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the Alamo who were fighting to the last but Fannin had surrendered). Then came the disaster of San Jacinto where his army was wiped out (he failed to take adequate precautions to watch for the American troops). He was captured and humiliated and forced to sign a surrender of Texas. Houston was kind to him: the troops wanted to string him up.<br /><br />Except for losing a leg in a battle against the French in 1838 he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars. He repudiated the forced surrender of Texas but could not militarily undue it. Instead he would lead Mexico into defeat in the war of 1846 - 48 against the Americans leading to the Mexican Session. The U.S. was decent enough to pay Mexico $15000000 for the Southwest but Mexico lost half of its territory. He would be President for the last time in 1853 in time to give Franklin Pierces horrendously bad administration its one moment of glory - Santa Anna sold the border of Arizona and New Mexico (the Gadsden Purchase) to the U.S. No other Mexican President (not even Porfirio Diaz) ever cost his country so much (Diaz did sell out to foreign business interests but he built up Mexicos economic muscles doing so). He was exiled in 1855 and settled in Staten Island. There he managed to do his most creative work: he introduced chicle to the U.S. and it became chewing gum. Some achievement! <br /><br />Julias Santa Anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became Americas best land purchase agent. He is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moments notice. Most of the time his chief aide Col. Black (David Ogden Stiers here a British born officer) holds his tongue - he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be. But Stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss. At the end when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead Alamo defenders Stiers suggests that they tell the world what Santa Anna is really like. And they did!',pos

The story is about a group of teenagers who for some inexplicable reason have super powers and when they use some special device they morph into strange poorly designed suits. The acting when theyre not in the retarded-looking suits is decent. Definitely not good but not the worst acting Ive ever seen. However when wearing their suits the actors acting goes from bad to worse; much much worse. The hyper-animated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary motions they do. Even when they talk they look like theyre having seizures. The villains are stupider than the Rangers. Every episode some weak idiotic villain comes up with some plan to destroy the Rangers. He/she then sends a force of hyper-animated aliens to attack the Rangers. The Rangers then initialize their 10-hour transforming animation then they annihilate the aliens. Then the poorly designed villain which can either be an armored villain that actually looks and acts evil to a humanoid ladybug-like creature with trumpets attached to its back that shows obvious signs of mental retardation. The Power Rangers fight the villain off then the villain turns into Godzilla whether it be by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes they fire nukes at the creatures and the creatures turn into giants). The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyper-animated and summon their Zords which are obviously toys that the producers of the show used special effects on to make them look real. The Power Rangers win the villain gets mad they all teach a valuable lesson and the show ends. Thats it. Twenty-five minutes of brain-washing fake kung fu fighting.',neg
'Im sorry but they did leave the impression that these commandos fought zombies before. But they sure didnt act like they even seen a zombie before. Jumping and turning their backs on them like amateurs. Second the characters are pretty badly written. The actors did the best they could with what was given I blame bad writing and bad directing. Lastly and here is where the spoiler warnings are highest. They loose the sample twice and the girl Jennifer Holland doesnt know if shes been bit or not. How stupid is that? As much as it hurts to be bitten one would think you would know plus gallons of blood leaking from your body is a good clue. Dumb the first movie had its flaws but it has re-watchablity unlike this disaster of a movie which I could barely get through once. I give the HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2: NO GUTS ALL STUPIDITY THE CRAP-O-LANTERN',neg
'In my opinion A GUY THING is a hilarious witty sexy romantic and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy. I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom-to-be and his soon-to-be sexy cousin-in-law. If you ask me they lit up the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I wrap this up Id like to say that the performances were top grade the direction was flawless the production design was nice the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion to anyone whos a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles I recommend this movie. Youre in for lots of laughs and thrills so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it.',pos
'Robin Williams shows his stand-up talents and boosts up his status as a comedian in this movie of whats wrong-in American politics and how can Hollywood try to make an influence without boring people. Of course Hollywood uses movies with hidden or not-so-hidden agendas. I think this movie is for people who likes stand-up and political discussion. And the trailers of this movie were for everybody just to make sure as many people as possible will see this. Everybody knows Hollywood is more liberal/democrat than the bush&co so they have to make these movies every now and then...but this one was perhaps too obvious at least I thought so for making any real change.<br /><br />Still great stand-up and fresh political issues and talks...I enjoyed it and thanks to IMDb.com ratings I was positively surprised when I walked out from the movie theater and yes I laughed many times. Sometimes you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousness....see this movie if you like good and clever stand-up or politics and you will not be offended by the several references of how things are not good right now. Rent it if that doesnt match you.',pos
'Damn straight.....this show was kick ass back in the day and still continues to outshine cartoons today. I cant wait to track down some of the DVDs to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. Ive already introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions one not the 15 vehicles one)and I laughed my head off when he said to me one day Dad..you sure watched some awesome cartoons when you were a kid!! How cool is that.<br /><br />Come on Hollywood dust this one off and give it a live action attempt. Couldnt be any worse than Spiderman 3 was...Man oh man... 2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies.<br /><br />OK Ill shuddup now<br /><br />Cheers',pos
'Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted out whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie but Id take a successful self-ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap.',pos
'This is by far the most vapid idiotic insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air and this is coming from someone who remembers San Pedro Beach Bums.<br /><br />My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a walk. The end result was straight out of Monty Pythons Ministry of Silly Walks sketch. I couldnt laugh hard enough.<br /><br />And then theres the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the...). She has to be the most annoying self-important woman on TV since Rosie ODonnell left The View. As if modeling was doing great things for mankind. Please. Ive never found her attractive and I dont find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.<br /><br />Someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.',neg
'This show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit down together and watch. The stories are a little slow for adults but they are still good. There are lots of children in my family boys and girls and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the Mystic Knights. It is a wonderful show and I hope that they will continue to keep making it. All of the kids in my family and myself think that Vincent Walsh is the best of them all. We have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing a great job. We wish all of the actors actresses writers directors and producers the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work.',pos
'If you want to enjoy the money you would spend to rent this money go buy a bag of ice and watch it melt. Thats more entertaining than this movie. <br /><br />Bill Cowell shame on you. <br /><br />Or if you wanna see this movie plot go in a corn field bring two of the most annoying little girls you can find run around for a couple hours having the girls scream as loud as possible. Then send me the couple bucks you woulda spent.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first Dark Harvest after watching the sequel Im going to cry myself to sleep.',neg
'This is a very good under-rated action/drama/and slightly historical movie.<br /><br />The basic story concerns Rob Roys borrowing of 1000 pounds its theft and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen.<br /><br />Cunningham( Tim Roth) is an amazing villain and character in this story. Brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evil.<br /><br />Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is excellent too but i think the writers used the word honour 1 too many times.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed.<br /><br />The Action is exciting and the sword play very realistic but not too gory. The story is good and you really want Rob to win.<br /><br />All in all just shy of a classic.',pos
'Ghillie a remake of the Telugu okkadu is thankfully a clarified version of the original. It packs the same punch and Dharani true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache. A flagging Vijays career with the entry of the likes of Surya and Vikram on the fray got the much needed uplift with this movie. This might well prove to be the best movie Vijay has ever been on considering the choices he has been making since then. The hard-working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by the industry and public alike.<br /><br />The tightly snug script which runs at a neck-break speed revolves around Velu a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of Kabaddi( a popular game among boys in India). The events following the chance encounter with Muthupandi his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the fulcrum and end of the movie. Vijay fits as a T into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door.<br /><br />Trisha has more than a stereotyped Tamil heroine mantle to play. The role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble. With limited dialogs Trisha exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. This is a classic case of a cover page girl coming-of-age to become a professional actress. Trisha became my personal favorite after this movie.<br /><br />The movie ends on predictable lines although one has to credit the Director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including Trishas change in decision to leave the country. Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter-weight for Vijays role. His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the heros armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessing.<br /><br />Overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing. I give it a clear 8 out of 10.',pos
'It is enjoyable and fast-paced. <br /><br />There is no way on Earth that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen. However the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly. It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him. I quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy.<br /><br />While his was the best performance most of the others were also very engaging. In particular the interplay between the policemen was natural and well-balanced and worked very well.<br /><br />It is only about 45 minutes long so the plot is not complex. More key is the style of the whole thing. It is very slick and vibrant and the backdrops are atmospheric especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich. The gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences but still manages to be distinctly Australian.',neg
'I was one of those few Americans that grew up with all of Gerry Andersens marvelous creations. Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action/adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it.<br /><br />I expected it to be a romp but I did not expect it to aim at such a low age group. Like Lost in Space this could have been both visually stunning and exciting. It should have focused on more action/adventure and the goal of the original series... saving people in trouble.<br /><br />Instead it focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers (who were cast too young anyway vs. the original). The breakout part was Lady Penelope and Parker. I didnt care too much for the characters in the original but I was grateful for them in the movie. They stole the show!<br /><br />I always enjoyed Thunderbirds more for the high-tech than the stories and even that did not get enough screen time as far as I was concerned. I would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets.<br /><br />But then Im just a big kid... ;)',neg
'A young American woman visits her Irish roots and fends off a druid witch who is out to possess her. Sounds intriguing but after an interesting start I got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going. The movie seems to be dithering in two directions -- are we watching the travails of the Irish-American woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch that returns from the past? The director cant seem to decide. The two doesnt seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere. This could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end. This was most boring and disappointing.',neg
'...in our household. Like everyone else who has commented on this movie my brothers (7 & 4 years old at the time) and I (10) would watch this movie over and over again. We all loved Star Wars but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure. We all loved the Camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song. There are some slow moments (the time spent with King Koo-Koo in his court) and we generally got bored after The Knights song (The reason that I {sound effect} is because I loooooove you) but we loved the journey to rescue Babbette and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of King Koo-Koo floating there dominating the entire horizon laughing maniacally at the end. I still to this day sing Hooray for me! Babbette of gay Paris! around my friends (Im 33 now) who just look at me as if Ive lost my mind; however when Im singing it Im 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of Star Wars.',pos
'This would have to be one of the worst if not the worst movie Ive ever nearly seen. (I couldnt watch it all the way through). Purely and simply its gratuitous violence just for the sake of it and the ridiculous story line only adds to the lacklustre and incompetent filming. Sick. And only suitable for those with a love for manic mutilation. After murdering several hundred men women and children Seed is finally caught after effortlessly killing several more police officers that finally get a tip as to his whereabouts. Hes sentenced to death by electric chair and miraculously survives! Buried alive he digs his way out and plots revenge against those that put him away and flicked the switch. Needless to say more gruesome murders ensue...',neg
'Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid 7 Euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie. My points;<br /><br />Film is based on 2 things;<br /><br />1) Ethnical point of View: As it happens on most of the American Films the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesnt make a person understand a culture. For example shaving is the sign of clean life in Asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that. Lebanese people are Christian (Ok they got that) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arabic countries. The main difference between eastern and western culture is we dont make ethnocentrism. So we dont judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film. <br /><br />2) Sexual revolution of a girl: There is nothing much to say about this. Show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than I will say that I am wrong.<br /><br />I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre. Please watch Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning about the movie.',neg
'Really for a short film that looks high budget this is just a candy coated piece of cr*p. It tries so hard to be hollywood. But even hollywood stories have an okay story (sometimes). Money wasted on an effort to be hollywood. Waste of almost a half hour of any viewers time. For the short film buff look elsewhere...',neg
'This is one of the best action films I have seen. Geenas portrayal of the tough as nails Charly/gentle mother Sam was superb and Samuel L Jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through with his classic one liners. Sure there were a few holes in the actual story but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.<br /><br />I felt Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam/Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie Stuart Little. Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse Brian Cox sweet little Yvonne Zima and newcomers sexy Craig Bierko and Melina Kanakaredes. This film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the diversion away from traditional male/female stereotypes as we see Sam/Charly (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) hurtling from one disaster to the next.<br /><br />While I and many others loved this movie it is fair to say that there will always be people that dont and thats fine - each to their own. I highly recommend this film to action fans for its hilarious scenes and fast-paced action.',pos
'Its really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official truth and caught so many news agencies with their pants down. This movie in my view deserves every price there is in journalism - its objective (yes!) courageous and a real scoop. It can do without comment fake scenes or leading questions - everyone including Chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words. The filmmakers only had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling.<br /><br />The Venezuelan elite teaches us How to depose of a President and sell it as a victory of democracy. Its amazing that they lost in the end - so far. From what I know the biggest TV station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked theyre still broadcasting via cable and satellite. I highly doubt whether George W. or Barack Obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup. But then they dont have to worry.<br /><br />The fact that the Chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so-called free (established) media really has become or has always been only more so. An important lesson to anyone interested in what really goes on in the world.<br /><br />The famous objectivity challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse us - it has been true with the effects of the Atomic bomb the US secret history of spreading democracy around the world or the Iraq war that according to Johns Hopkins has killed 13 million Iraquis by now not to mention the 60000 Afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned. To be objective Saddam Hussein was less damaging to his people than the US. And the US is ready & willing to be more damaging to the Iranians that he was.<br /><br />Im quite curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague whether there will be any mention of our involvement in supporting and training Pol Pots guerrillas in the 80s when they had been largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not.<br /><br />All the more reason to turn to the Independent media for balance if not exposure of fraud.',pos
'Like a lot of people I loved the original; American Graffiti was one of the great movies of the 70s. The sequel More American Graffiti is a horrible depressing mess of a movie. It wasnt funny the wide-eyed likable characters had become cynical and jaded and the stories were contrived (such as Lauries character having another brother because Richard Dreyfuss didnt do the sequel and Terry the Toad and Pharaoh Joe somehow managing to serve together in Vietnam). They even have a police officer by the name of Falfa (Harrison Fords character in the original) who makes a cameo. He doesnt even look like Harrison Ford who was way too big a star by 1979 to even bother with this garbage.<br /><br />The operative word here is funny. This movie isnt even amusing. Debbie (Candy Clark) is a stripper mixed in with a bunch of dope spoking hippies and trying to bail her dealer boyfriend out of jail; Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams) the lovebirds in the original have two kids and have become an annoying bickering couple; Adorable little tomboy Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) has become Rainbow yet another hippie child. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is a loser race car driver whose fortune was foretold at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack whose voice was such an integral part of the original and gave it such a great flow only is heard sporadically.<br /><br />Perhaps it was different writers a different director and the complete lack of a cohesive story line that makes this movie such a dismal failure.<br /><br />The episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere to be found in the sequel. It was a movie that didnt need to be made and its best just to remember what a great movie American Graffiti was and avoid the movie with More in the title.',neg
'Like the previous two Mad Max films Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is not exception to the violence and strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to tomorrow morrow land. This is generally a warped film with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner methane-pigs and odd characters. I got very bored by watching it all and it offered nothing to me. I did not feel inspired after watching this film; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film. Its too weird for me and it was much too dull.',neg
'Ill start blasting the movie first. Remove Abbott and Costello from the cast and youve got a badly colored movie stiff cardboard from the casting department badly dubbed sound (especially during the singing!) and annoying dialog (ex. listen to the line Mr. Dinklepuss ad infinitum). Obviously some studio hack thought that they could cash in on Disneys CLASSIC presentation of Mickey and the Beanstalk but maybe audiences were either more gullible back then (improbable) or stuck in a double feature (more probable). Even children should feel insulted at having this movie shown to them. A total waste of celluloid. Now about the acting of Abbott and Costello. Bud Abbott always played the straight man and by all accounts was the nicer person off the set. On radio his character was usually the smooth fast talker and was especially funny when his speed caused him to flub his lines and smooth over the mistakes. In the movies he still plays the straight man but is more of a con artist. Not that hes bad at it but that character has been played to perfection by Groucho Marx. The real travesty of the duo on film is Lou Costello. Again on radio he was funny. He played a character that was a little slower than Abbott but not too much slower! He was also glib with the lines and got me laughing when he would ad-lib at Abbotts mistakes. On film I dont know if it was his decision or not but in the movies his character becomes a shoddy impersonation of Stan Laurel which in turn was even more shoddily done by Jerry Lewis. Why the change? he was funny on radio when he was a smarta-- but here he becomes a child-like character that looks like hes mugging for the cameras in every shot. this characterization is shown in every movie they do and only brings a stain to the reputation they had on radio. What is left to their film career is a poor (very VERY poor) copy of Laurel and Hardy. The movies would have been much funnier if they had played their radio characters instead of retreads of stock casting.',neg
'This is one of the most underrated movies of the 1990s. If you allow yourself to identify with the Patricia Arquette character you will find it to be a very moving story of a woman regaining a sense of purpose to her life and finding a new will to live.<br /><br />Arquettes performance is brave because it is purposefully wooden -- its a way of defining her characters spiritual death her complete lack of a desire to be alive. She moves through life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and she cant see the point of living. What is moving is how in the course of the story she is reawakened -- by the Burmese landscape by the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes and by the primal choices she is forced to confront.<br /><br />Boorman supports this visually (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of his most gorgeous haunting scores) with an often static camera and with a propensity to shoot through glass windows windshields etc. We are on the outside looking in just like Arquette.... until she finds herself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for her life.<br /><br />I recommend the 1954 movie THE PURPLE PLAIN as well. Its a similar story in a similar setting and makes for a fascinating comparison.',pos
'Ive read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict British school in the 1960s to understand this. Maybe thats true if so then this movie is outdated.<br /><br />*************SPOILER ALERT**************************************** The ending makes about as much sense as all the kids whore anti-government and anti-corporation without having any better solution that doesnt torch society to a Mad Max type cinder.<br /><br />Yeah the main characters could leave but they dont. The reasons they go about this dont make sense. There isnt enough character development to explain why. What shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at. It is mentioned that war is the final creative expression quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have and it makes no sense.<br /><br />The characters who go on a murder spree arent fighting the institution theyre just killing people. I thought they mightve used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end that wouldve made greater symbolic sense but they didnt.<br /><br />tl;dr - This movie is an adolescents daydream of fighting against authority that plagues them though in reality they need. It has no moral symbolic truth or meaning to it; this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in power that annoy you.<br /><br />If you think a murder rampage/ school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you dont like then I guess youll love this movie. If youre like me and youre working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly (very blindly in this movie) rebelling against the man this movie is juvenile and boring.<br /><br />You can also tell in parts that funding was lacking and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder.<br /><br />All in all this seems like a very rough draft of what couldve been an okay movie but no effort is put into the dialogue character development or moral so its just... poorly done.<br /><br />If... only I could get my two hours back.',neg
'Well I suppose the good news concerning William Wincklers 2001 opus The Double-D Avenger is that it manages to unite three of Russ Meyers mammarian marvels--Kitten Natividad Haji and Raven de la Croix--in one picture. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they shot this thing...or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) The bad news though (and theres plenty of it) is that this film--if it can even be called that having been shot straight to video--is a complete misfire a total abortion an out-and-out atrocity an absolute abomination and truly one of the worst pictures that I have ever seen. Look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made! The plot here such as it is deals with Kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer (oy) and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in L.A. Too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely (you should pardon the expression) flat that there is ZERO actual nudity in the film at all (other than some old photos of Kitten in her heyday) and that some shaving cream and a papier-mache boulder are the sum total of the special FX. The Meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth/saggy in the chest to put it kindly although Sheri Dawn Thomas as bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!) does manage to uh stand out nicely. So why have I given this juvenile unfunny failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1? To be succinct: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice-over commentary in the special features of the DVD I just watched is absolutely hilarious especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word breast from the 1000+ on his Web sites Canonical Hooters List. The man is a national treasure and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status!',neg
'I watched this movie also and altho it is very well done I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children.. The terror on this mothers face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking. And the sad thing is--internally she dies. Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains. All the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has. I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed. Im surprised this movie takes place in Detroit because when I watched it I thought for sure the people had come to Cincinnati Ohio. This also was a route for the poor from the mountains.',neg
'Given the subject matter of drug addiction Down to the Bone almost cant help but be a rather depressing film. But depressing doesnt necessarily have to mean bad. Unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad. The film has some good things going for it most notably the quality performance of Vera Farmiga in the central role of Irene a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction. But there isnt enough good here to outweigh the bad. The films failings lie mainly with the story which fails to captivate and never really seems to get going. Irene goes to rehab and comes home to a clueless husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to kick her habit. Irene grows close to another recovering addict a male nurse from her rehab center. Complications ensue. But the story never really sparks to life. It doesnt seem as if the movie is really going anywhere. You can say its a stark realistic look at the day-to-day struggles of an addict. Maybe so but in this case it doesnt make for an interesting movie. The whole thing has a very blah feel to it. The minimalist cinematography doesnt help matters adding another layer of drab to the incredibly drab proceedings. And none of the other performances measure up to Farmigas. Hugh Dillon is OK as Irenes male nurse friend but nobody else in the cast adds anything of value to the proceedings. All in all this movie is a bleak depressing and rather dull ride.',neg
'Gung Ho was a good idea however it is to much to ask Americans viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition.In this movie the main character Hunt Stevenson(Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese auto company to come to America and help his dying Pennslyvania town. Two things come at you.First why would a Japanese company come to America to make cars when they do so and so well at that? Secondly can anyone understand that American companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape American labor costs? It makes the films premise then that the Number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its top competitors(aside from Germany)and put a plant there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time. But he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but Director Ron Howard cant keep this from becoming a TV movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations not withstanding. Gung Ho has a Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel to it as the producers of both TV shows made the film and then made the TV version of this movie as well which gives the film its lightweight feel.The Japanese manager gets to love his American workers and feels he and other Japanese people can learnfrom Americans.His No.2 man Saito who supposedly doesnt like Americans all that much doesnt think so.I would have prefered all the Japanese characters been like Saito than the soft goofball characters they made the Japanese out to be.It would have made the film more interesting.',neg
'Watching John Cassavetes film Opening Night I was reminded of something that Quentin Tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting. He referred to an example of say if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it wouldnt be the end of his life but that it would affect him and that without a doubt he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy. Otherwise as he said what am I doing? I couldnt help but think of his words when watching Gena Rowlands character Myrtle Gordon who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario. There is more to this in Cassavetes film of course since its about how the theater works around a star actress what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character and how one lives when all one has (like Myrtle Gordon) is the theater.<br /><br />Near the beginning of the film after exiting a performance Myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named Nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to Myrtle. Its a touching little moment but it doesnt last as she has to get in the car (pouring rain and all). She then watches in horror as the girl who stood right next to the car as it drove off gets hit by another car in an auto accident. Shes not sure really what happened but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit. From then on shes sort of stunned by this even after she thinks its out of her system. At first this shows in small ways like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor (played by Cassavetes) and cant seem to stand being hit - she blames it on the lack of depth in the character (the writer: What do you think the play lacks? Hope says Myrtle)- but then Nancy starts to show up to her an apparition that to Myrtle is all to real until shes suddenly gone.<br /><br />Cassavetes as in the past films is after a search for what it means to have emotion to really feel about something and feel it or the lack thereof and how it affects others around the person. This isnt exactly new ground for Rowlands who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in Woman Under the Influence (in that case because of alcohol) nor would it be alien territory for costar Ben Gazzara who just came off starring in Killing of a Chinese Bookie. But the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene; Cassavetes doesnt tell them how to get from A to B in a scene and he doesnt need to. Theres a mood in a Cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camera-work. You know Myrtle for example should be content somehow even if it isnt with the plot. But shes haunted and is unsatisfied with her characters lack of depth and the tone of the play (Aging who goes to see that? she asks the playwright) and it starts to affect those around her too.<br /><br />The question soon becomes though not what is the usual. A conventional dramatist would make the conflict Will she be able to go on stage will the show go on? This isnt important for Cassavetes even if its there as is the question Will she be alright? Perhaps going through such a grueling play as The Second Woman could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality (seeing Sara and attacking her in front of total strangers who wonder what the hell is going on)? Or will the plays lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her? The depths Rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing and that its expected doesnt mean its any duller than Woman Under the Influence- if anything its just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession and consequently the other performances are just as true from Gazarra to Nancy played by a subtle Laura Johnson. Cassavetes answers to his own posed questions arent easy.<br /><br />One of the real thrills of Opening Night along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script is to see Cassavetes take on the theater the way he does. We see the play performed- and its apparently a real play- and we only know slightly what its about. When we see the actors on the stage performing it we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on (relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence) and the improvisation of the actors. I wondered watching how much really was improvised how much Cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where Myrtle starts to go loopy or in the climax is completely smashed. Hes on the stage too so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen.<br /><br />Its funny startling chilling and edge-of-your-seat stuff some of the best theater-on-film scenes ever put in a movie and we see the lines between actor on stage actor on film actor with actor blur together wonderfully. Opening Night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness reality and fiction where the love is between people and really finally what does acting mean?',pos
'Very rarely do I give less rave reviews on a show or film I dislike on IMDb but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful its terrible.<br /><br />I wouldnt have minded if this had been an animated series- wouldve been better that way I guess but as a live-action show it typifies the terms cheesy and campy. Of which Power Rangers is. Five multi- coloured spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills. The costumes are horrid- they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear. The acting is woeful and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch it makes Jean- Claude Van Damme look as equally as good as Bruce Lee which is an understatement in itself. In fact they look as if they are jumping and dancing about; like it was some version of the Nutcracker or they were doing ballet rather than fighting. Besides there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun-yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly.<br /><br />Kids show or not this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity. And even though this version is set in America you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the US but rather in Japan; thus the somewhat fake fighting and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version-only to be juxtaposed onto the US version.<br /><br />If you like this type of thing then stick with Sentai- the Japanese equivalent.',neg
'Mans Castle is a wonderful example of a Pre-Code film. It involves realistic events with truly enjoyable and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill a free soul without a dime in his pocket. He makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings. One night he meets Trina a beauty by any standards who is cold and alone. She has refused to resort to prostitution so she has not eaten for several days but the two take very well to each other and form a relationship. His free spirit tempts him to leave her so life is rocky but there is a true spark between the two even if they live in a shack by the river.<br /><br />Tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen. His characters are amazing and relatable. We can see his thoughts on his face making him easy to identify with even if we believe he is behaving badly. Young is great in pre-code films. Her character is very sweet but far from perfect making her all the more likable.<br /><br />Pre-code elements include skinny dipping pregnancy before marriage and crime.',pos
'This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the movie seem partially realistic. I used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it. This movie was kind of like a Cinderella movie but a little bit different. A father of 12 princesses gets very sick. His cousin poisons him and wants the throne. The girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mothers stories. Its up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their handsome prince. It was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it. We enjoyed it a lot and also enjoyed the Indian talking parrot. The music was very nice and made the movie even greater. It had a great classical orchestra. The voices were great and the characters were adorably sweet and cute. I liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family. All in all Id watch it again.',pos
'Eight academy nominations? Its beyond belief. I can only think it was a very bad year - even by Hollywood standards. With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leads I probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me and I feel distinctly cheated as a result.<br /><br />So its a black comedy is it? Can anyone tell me where the humour is in Prizzis Honor? Its certainly tasteless (the shooting in the head of a policemans wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life) but with the exception of a joke about your favourite Mexican cigars (which I imagine is an old joke for Americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything Cuban for the last 50 years) I failed to spot anything of a comic nature - and I did try. There is a lot of Mafia cliché but cliché doesnt constitute humour in my book.<br /><br />Is it a romantic comedy of sorts? Never. The characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli.<br /><br />Is it a cleverly devised parody about the Mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd and it usually just has the feel of a really bad (and cheap) Mafia movie. It feels more like a homage than a parody.<br /><br />With one-dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces. Well it isnt enough; even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression Jack Nicholson (repleat with puffed up top lip ... now is that meant to be a parody of Brandos padded jowls in The Godfather?... Oh! Who cares?... all I know is it isnt funny).<br /><br />Throw in some slow plodding direction (this film drags on for 2 hours) some hopelessly daft and clichéd dialogue such as; You remember the Camora? Well were far bigger well track you down wherever you go and clichéd mannerisms and youll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say capiche?. Prizzis Honor is far from being Hustons masterpiece and is rather a very poor last work. Its definitely one work in the great directors canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the Hudson River.',neg
'Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is Juhi Chawla. Little does Juhi know in the film that Shahrukh has a MAJOR crush on her and is constantly stalking her. I have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy... like the threatening phone calls. Never in my life will I forget the line I love you K..k..k..Kiran!<br /><br />Its just too bad that Shahrukh and Juhi werent exactly together in the film. But Juhi and Sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie. Though Shahrukhs role was pretty psychotic I still think he did a great job of playing it and cant possibly imagine anyone else doing that role. No wonder he got an award for Darr in 94!<br /><br />Juhi... what can I say??? She looks especially amazing in this film! Its not that she doesnt always look amazing in her other films but Darr did give the public a wonderful image of her!<br /><br />As for the music... it was excellent! Especially Jaadu Teri Nazar one of my all time favorite songs. I also thought Tu Mere Samne was quite nice also.<br /><br />A must see for everyone! Overall Darr deserves a 9/10!',pos
'Mr. Carlin left our common forum in June of 2008 shortly after going to the hospital for pains in the chest (he had a history of heart trouble). The media and comics everywhere covered the loss more than I or he would have EVER expected ... but he was the Grandfather of observational comedy.<br /><br />THIS recording was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the topic of death and the prospects of life thereafter. Filming of the project occurred shortly after his seventieth birthday which he was happy to have attained (observed?). I have followed Carlins career from the days of fuzzy black and white television and enjoyed his topical record albums.<br /><br />It is a privilege for ANY Carlin fan to at least see (if not own a copy) of this particular show. He was still fast moving and with great timing even at 70! As he would say he is NOT smiling down from Heaven on you.

'Olivier Kosentsev Richardson Coranado Zefferelli and Almerayeda have all directed Hamlet but Branaghs the only one who got it right.<br /><br />This is the only film of Hamlet that contains the full four hours of William Shakespeares masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story.<br /><br />Not many directors could pull this off without boring their audience but Branaghs skillful use of bravora film style and stunt casting allows people to see the importance of the scenes that are usually cut out.<br /><br />Examples of this include Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo whos entire purpose in the film was to simply say yes my lord as Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. This also included Billy Crystal as the grave digger Robin Williams as Osric Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as the actor.<br /><br />Branaghs performance of the Act 4 scene 4 soliloquy (Which again is usually cut out) is nothing short of c cinematic marvel as the camera slowly pulls back as the intensity grows. It is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding.<br /><br />Branagh is the only film maker that understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general audience.<br /><br />This is a must see for everyone who enjoys good story telling brilliant actingand incredible direction. All of these part of William Shakespeares greatest triumph.',pos
'When it comes to horror movies I am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore sub-par production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare. This movies simply has no good scares to offer. It cant even be enjoyed as camp. Bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad. I felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction. I doubt they got any rehearsal either. Its embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance. Its quite easily one of the worst movies Ive ever seen.<br /><br />I dont normally write reviews but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. If you must watch this movie dont miss the Making of-featurette. The writer/director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move. (Seen it.) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if its a new-age Citizen Kane. Its like listening to a group of third-graders take you behind the scenes of their Christmas pageant. They truly think theyve created something of substance. Its sad really The only reason I gave this movie a 2 is because I think 1 should be reserved for true atrocities like Manos: Hands of Fate and Space Mutiny. So American Nightmare isnt the WORST movie Ive ever seen but Id have to say that its somewhere in the bottom fifty.',neg

'Affable aspiring cartoonist Hoops McCann (a wonderfully engaging performance by John Cusack) and his best buddy George (the deliciously deadpan Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school. Hoops George and several newfound pals come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore at her most charming) a singer whos family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer/director Savage Steve Holland offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb but still very funny jokes. The constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy good-natured and infectiously inane vitality to it thats impossible to either dislike or resist. Moreover the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment: Bobcat Goldthwait as the spastic Egg Stork Tom Villard as his goofy brother Clay Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond Mark Metcalf as evil rich jerk Aquilla Beckersted Matt Mulhern as the mean Teddy Kimberly Foster as the fetching Cookie Joe Flaherty as the gung-ho General Raymond William Hickey as cranky Old Man Beckersted Jeremy Piven as smug preppy bully Ty and John Matuszak as hulking biker Stan. Isidore Mankofskys slick cinematography the hip thrashy soundtrack Cory Lerios cool rockin score and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent. Single funniest scene: Egg in a Godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party. An absolute hoot.',pos
'This has to rate as one of the cheesiest of TV shows in a long time.<br /><br />Jose Ferrer played the title character Nemo. He did the part justice and certainly looked the part. But nowadays it strikes me that the Nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to Captain Birds Eye from the TV commercials. Or maybe its the other way around.<br /><br />His nemesis Professor Cunningham was overacted brilliantly by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to get over his Penguin days from Batman. Although he doesnt do his Penguin quack here he is without parallel as the maniacal Professor. Only John Colicos of Battlestar Galactica fame chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot.<br /><br />I never can recall what the grudge was between Nemo and Cunningham but it must have been severe since the Prof. never missed a chance to try and scupper Nemo and vice-versa.<br /><br />The effects were nothing special though Prof. Cunninghams submarine was way better looking than Nemos. It also had a crew of strange fish-like amphibians that served Cunningham and did his every bidding.<br /><br />However the most memorable aspect of the whole show was Prof. Cunninghams secret weapon. The Delta Beam! He was forever saying Fire Delta Beam! whereupon a fishy crewman would horribly overract the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug. Truly priceless! They dont make them like this anymore and perhaps just as well. But like other series of this era for those who remember it it will always have an affectionate if cheddar-covered place in our hearts.',neg
'pokemon the movie was a terrible film. unlike the first one this is not a good film at all. the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it. in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent. the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad. tracey really doesnt have much to say or do and unlike brock offers no comic relief. the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining. overall this film isnt worth renting and the short movie before didnt do anything for me or my wife. and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans.oh well maybe the next one will be better.cant ge t much worse',neg

'Warning: mild spoilers.<br /><br />The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing - even moving - episode in American history and World Religious history. This movie portrays events in the life of Joseph Smith whom Mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on the earth. Ive so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing.<br /><br />Joseph Smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin Hyrum & Joseph) who at a very young age needed an operation. The operation done without our modern conveniences was bloody and difficult. The scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents.<br /><br />Josephs religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what Mormons call the First Vision was interestingly portrayed. The face of Jesus is never shown but you see the unmistakable nail marks in His hands. The rejection by religious leaders and many in his small New York community is sweetened at least slightly by Josephs marriage to Emma.<br /><br />This movie does not clearly map out the events of Mormon Church history but merely jumps from scene to scene. This is not a critique - simply a note about the style.<br /><br />The practice of tarring and feathering is shown and it is especially dramatic and moving when Joseph delivers a sermon about the Saviors love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked.<br /><br />The movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of Mormonism as an infant church while at the same time the ever-deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments.<br /><br />The film shows many scenes from Josephs life including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to Emma. An attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of Josephs life including his fierce love for his wife his endless love for children his wit his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition his religious sentiments and his compassion.<br /><br />As Joseph and Hyrum ride to Carthage never to return home alive most of the characters from throughout the movie whose lives had been touched by Joseph are shown along the way helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful.<br /><br />At the end the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is portrayed and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed.<br /><br />When I first watched the movie I assumed it was made by the Church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I no longer think that is the case although I hope the movie can do just that. As an insider I find that the film is a celebration of Joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him. I am curious to see how outsiders will view the film - whether they will simply see it as propagandic an epic story of an American religious man or something else.<br /><br />The film is beautifully shot family friendly moving and hopefully something good for everyone. That the events portrayed actually happened in these United States of America is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law - we moderns take for granted.',pos
'Yes I am just going to tell you about this one so dont read if you want surprises. I got this one with the title Christmas Evil. There was also another Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night Bloody Night. Whereas Silent Night Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night Deadly Night) had lots of potential and was very close to being good this one wasnt quite as good. It started out interesting enough watching the villain (if you can call him that) watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie doesnt deliver. You need character development but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps. About an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror and the guys he kills arent even his targets they are just making fun of him. This is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty. He then proceeds to try and kill this other guy and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace. He promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out. He then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom. He cant seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat. What the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place? Oh yeah the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too. Well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play. What was that even about? He kept talking about something that was never really explained. How does it end you ask well since I have spoilers I will tell you. He runs off the road in his van and proceeds to well lets just say it was lame!!!!!!!!!!!!',neg

Very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the first theme and that the audience was invited to play along too. I must admit I was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by golly Ill be writing those recipes down. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with family. Those who havent tuned in yet find out what channel and the time I assure you that you wont be disappointed.',pos
'After I first saw this I thought Wow this is the most spectacular movie visually-speaking Ive ever seen. Since that time Ive seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department. Im just disgusted the long-awaited DVD was so poorly done the quality of this transfer hardly better than the VHS tape.<br /><br />The jungle scenes are filmed in Cameroon and lush is the best adjective to describe what you see. Except for jungle sounds seeing is certainly almost everything in the beginning as there is almost no hearing no dialog until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) befriends Ian Holm and vice-versa....so be ready for that if you havent watched this film. <br /><br />Story-wise all Ill say is this is not the Tarzan many of us came to know in Johnny Weismuller films.....but thats not a complaint. For those craving action and dont care about cinematography as I do you just have to get past that silent introduction period <br /><br />In this Tarzan version our hero goes back to Scotland (his roots) adapts to that environment (for the most part....and a little too quickly for credibility frankly) and then returns to the jungle without Jane. This is supposedly more true to the Tarzan books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.<br /><br />The special effects in here were done by Rick Baker one of the best in the business. Sharp DVD or not this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes.',pos
'Pick a stereotype any stereotype (whether racial sexual cultural etc.) and I bet youll find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think that all Hispanic teenage boys are stupid hairy inarticulate and dirty troublemakers? Are Hispanic girls sex-crazed easy ass-baring sluts? Do Black people all want to start fights and carry guns? Do all gay people throw themed parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them? Are all White teenage girls rich stuck-up princesses who are bored with White teenage boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous? If you answered yes to any of the previous questions you my friend are a bigot and you will LOVE Wassup Rockers.<br /><br />Director Larry Clark likes to shock his audiences (I was 15 years old the first time I saw Kids and I think thats why Im still a virgin) but Wassup Rockers isnt shocking its just bad. He tries to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialog and body-hair close-ups but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic.<br /><br />Simply put Wassup Rockers is a teenage boys fantasy.

'I HATE plane crash movies...ALL of them! In fact I hate them all with a passion! First of all they are cheap-looking and have no craftsmanship! Secondly they insult the airline industry and say to the audience that all planes do is...FALL OUT OF THE SKY AND CRASH!<br /><br />Why I wince at such a film? This could happen to any of us and with worser consequences than those suffered by the characters in said movie...which is the only chilling aspect of an airline disaster yarn such as this. I hate this movie because its like all the 50000000 stupid-ass airplane chaos movies before it! Freefall is like all the others: nothing more than boredom before the clichéd bullshit dramatic scenes take place. <br /><br />First off we have same cast of retards on this flying death trap: The Cleaver-esquire family of three the yuppie baastard and the bitch of a flight attendant complete with a big blond hairdo from 1987 scolding anyone who is the least bit frightened! <br /><br />My second gripe is this shouldnt be a full-length movie but a documentary explaining everything about the Air Canada Gimbli Glider incident a.k.a Freefall right down to the safety precautions.<br /><br />My third and final gripe is with all airline films of this caliber(with the exception of Fearless) Why the hell did the male steward instruct the passengers to remove there shoes? (I could understand high heels and sharp loose objects but cmon!)Like thats gonna make them any more f#*king safer than they are now! This plane if they(the passengers) didnt know any better: knew they were going to crash land. Why would you force 100 injured people down a rubber slide that can cause skin to peel and bleed on impact only to walk in their stocking feet on a debris field! Does this make any sense to anyone?<br /><br />Fearless and the hit ABC series Lost had more depth and realism to air disaster than just plane malfunctions-people panic-stewards become assholes-plane lands without wheels in a field-people wander without shoes and jackets etc. The same old crap from Airport 1975! Freefall was so typical of a air-crash movie that I almost expect to see either Charlton Heston or Peter Graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment. Could we at least see how these poorly-acted characters go back to normalcy instead of people rejoicing amidst the impending tragedy that is staring in front of them? Typical moronic Lifetime movie! Cheap and Stupid! <br /><br />The director of Freefall should stick to cheap made-for-TV movies with white middle-aged women with stupid teenage kids who do drugs and have marital problems. As for suspense...leave it to the professionals...you hack! Why should we the audience sit through over an hour and a half of this Airport wannabe rehash. I hope to god they dont make plane crash movies like this anymore. If this were like the ABC series Lost then it would be something to watch. But this is utter crap and then some. Stop turning every plane disaster movie into Airport 1975! This is not Airport this is cheap pathetic waste of my time. I would not recommend this movie or any made-for-TV air disaster movie to anyone not even my worst enemies.',neg
'I hate to throw out lines like this but in this case I feel like I have to: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last 5 years. There I said it. And now that I have gotten that out of my system please let me explain why.<br /><br />When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury. That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately the filmmakers take it no further. Those who encounter the curse are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. You want more? Well too bad. Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of creepy images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his own original film(s) valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. It pretty much unfolds like this:<br /><br />-person walks into house<br /><br />-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard <br /><br />-person goes to investigate<br /><br />-sound starts to get loud<br /><br />-person sees a ghost<br /><br />-loud scream and/or cat screech<br /><br />-cut to black<br /><br />Before the audience is even given a hint of plot this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually somewhat creepy. Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on. By the time the end of the film rolled around my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would end with a loud scream and a cut to black. We were never proved wrong.<br /><br />The film has no liner storyline instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right. The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason. I havent seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had. If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone?<br /><br />Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made $15 million its first weekend THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie. The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made $40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the scariest movie ever made. I wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE?',neg
'I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as well done as they were nor did I expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me and Ill be on the lookout for the next movie like it. I especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie but it wasnt a cheesy vampire flick nor did it over embellish that fact. The characters all had human traits. The way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives. I give this movie two thumbs so far up.

'I caught this movie right in my eye when I was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema. The tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it I thought of the possibility of it being similar to National Lampoons Dorm Daze. I liked that movie aside from having a huge collection of such genres I decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser.<br /><br />Delightfully I came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie. Amanda Bynes definitely kicked it off better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. Being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to. This movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time. The only way of pulling it off is through this movie.<br /><br />The principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors.

Id rather see Milan Kunderas novel turned on fire than into this something which the director probably calls adaptation.<br /><br />All the beautiful philosophy that asks is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders or cope with the unbearable lightness of being? is put aside and instead all the movie deals with is Daniel Day Lewis (I cannot say Tomas) sexual adventures with his dumb wife his mistress and his other mistresses. François Truffaut already said it: bad directors make bad movies. Dont waste your time and money. Read the book instead its really worth it.',neg
'Disappointing and irritating. The screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichés in a disjointed fashion. Character is not explored in depth. These are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element the mothers affair with her daughters lover. <br /><br />Anne Reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye. The script portrays Darren (Daniel Craig) as a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde without any hints about why except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene. <br /><br />A mature writer could have done so much more with this topic.',neg
'Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years back wanted to cast Dilip Kumar in the lead<br /><br />The film finally was re-written and made in 2003 and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at times<br /><br />Like the reason Amitabh-Hema separate is too superficial even the way the youth are shown is too bad like Gulshan in AVTAAR<br /><br />The message though comes well but things are presented in a clichéd manner Salmans character is the worst looks straight out of a storybook while the climax speech of Bachchan is good and also the final of not forgiving the sons is good<br /><br />Ravi Chopra does a good job Music is decent the songs sung by Bachchan stand out<br /><br />Amitabh excels like always he has played an elder stern father earlier but here he plays a victim and portrays it well His last speech is great Hema is good in her part Aman Verma stands out Samir Soni is okay Naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent though Divya Dutta stands out Salman Khan is fake Mahima is okay Paresh and Lillete are lovable',neg
'I agree with with of the messages on here that the book is not like the movie. I read the book as a sophomore in high school in Sumter SC. I instantly fell in love with the book and eagerly awaited the release of the mini series. As much as I liked the movie and thought it was very well done I was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book. I was glad the Orry was not killed off like he was in Love and War or N&S II.<br /><br />Having grown up in SC and graduating from University of SC I fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book. I had the honor of meeting John Jakes at a symposium in 1988 at USC. I stayed around afterwards and meet Mr.Jakes. Unfortunately I did not get to ask him a question. But meeting him was honor enough. I majored in accounting but got my minor in Southern Studies. In addition I patterned a lot of my mannerisms after Orry Main. Orry and myself are very much alike. I feel I was born 150 years too late. I am a southern gentleman and very proud of this.<br /><br />Well I fell in love with 2 women in the movie....Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Man did I have the hots for Wendy!!!! I never quite could find a real life version of her. I hope one day too!!!',pos
'Uzumaki which translates into spirals arriving within this new wave of Asian Horror films following such hits like Ringu Ju-On and The Eye (two of them with remakes.. and much more coming like Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters) falls short of the spooky supernatural thriller element so characteristic of the other movies the only thing that remains is weirdness and not in a Tim Burton or David Lynch kind of way but in a irrelevant and dull way. <br /><br />Its start with a girl some other kid with a crush on her her best friend and his dad whos obsessed with Uzumakis! Everything that happens concerns Uzumakis people die and you see Uzumakis. So okay Itll go along with it Im kinda amuse by spirals myself characters dont seem to go anywhere but Ill play along. We find out the town is cursed by Uzumakis people start screaming at Uzumakis and the point is Uzumakis are everywhere the movie is a disaster it doesnt know where to go except to show you the power of Uzumakis!!!!!!!!! There are some cool concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees Uzumakis on her fingerprints but then theres another scene where she hears her husband (from beyond the grave!!) tell her that she also has Uzumakis in her ear the way they handled that scene was just laughable not even cheesy fun there are also some (a little bit) of cool visuals like the collection the father has of Uzumakis and the girl with the Uzumakis hair.. yep Uzumakis hair its out of context though its seems like it was taken out of a Fruit Snack commercial where if you eat an Uzumakis fruits snack its taste is so incredible your hair turns into Uzumakis now if this wasnt bad enough suddenly out of nowhere there are Snail Men.. or ManSnails whatever and you know why? right? Because in their shells they have Uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiis. That only left time enough for a crappy anti-climatic ending and by that time I was sick of friggin uzumakis.. uzumaki here uzumaki there sure look around you how many Uzumakis can you find If you want to see a movie about spirals go see PI (3.1416) now there youll find some pretty cool uzumaki concepts in between the meaning of life and Dark City has also a little bit of a spiraling thing in there.<br /><br />This movie could have worked as a music video it has already garnered a cult following and thats why I was compelled to see it but after doing so Im not sure why people think its great. I was truly disappointed.',neg
'This is not a boring movie the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character Miles Berkowitz both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all that : what is written what came by chance ? Both answers yes or no portrays M.Berkowitz as a low average human beeing. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one I recommand you to read some independant comic books : Chester Brown Joe Matt...<br /><br />Beside of this I felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country France. I know american people usually say that the french are arrogant (that might be true then) etc. and for sure the french (and the whole world) have lots of griefs against america but why so much hate ? Dont think I couldnt like this movie only because of that anyhow.',neg
'Never viewed this film and consider it a great Classic with great veteran actors. In the period that this film was made people in America were different there was no TV or all the modern things we have today except the Radio and the starting out of great films being made in Hollywood. Sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today. Ann ShirleyMurder My Sweet44 played a young orphan gal who was called Carrot Top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks who were like two wise owls and watched over Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened the entire town found out about it within minutes. It is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living. Today it seems very corn ball and stupid but believe me this was the way people were in America during the 1920. & 30s and they were a great generation that loved good family films.',pos
'Shot entirely on location in Bulgaria The Man With The Screaming Brain is a hilarious love story between two rich ugly-American types and a murderous hotel maid gypsy. <br /><br />William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and catch a cab driven by hustler Yegor. Things start to go awry when Tatoya the maid murders Yegor and William and a mad scientist implants a piece of Yegors brain in Williams head. Robots eventually become involved as do gypsies with broken fingers head injuries Bruce Campbell riding a pink Vespa with prissy little streamers and All-Of-Me-style physical comedy by a character at war with a voice in his brain who controls half of his body.<br /><br />The Man With The Screaming Brain is an incredibly funny film. It has the most hilarious tracking shot I have ever seen (when Bruce Campbells character fresh from the lab and complete with giant forehead scar and blue hospital pajamas runs into a square and scares a crowd of people) and a falling-down-the-steps murder scene that had the entire test screening audience screaming laughing. The whole thing is a damn riot from beginning to end and I would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy Bruce Campbell or B-movies in general.',pos
'This is the classic case of an excellent film being looked over by the American public simply due to the fact it didnt have Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger as the lead man - Adrian Quinn does a better dual performance thats right you heard it dual performance in this film than either of those have ever pulled off in their careers! Well anyway now to the review...<br /><br /> The Assignment is loosely based upon the story of Carlos the Jackal a 1970s radical who terrorized Europe for years before finally being apprehended by French agents. In this adaptation a US Naval officer (Adrian Quinn) is on leave in Israel when he is apprehended by Mossad (Isreals crack intelligence / counter-terrorism agency) and took in for questioning due to the fact he looks EXACTLY like the jackal (this is the one extremely cheesey part of the film but trust me it doesnt detract from the great value of this film). When it is discovered Mr. Ramirez is not the Jackal however he is recruited by a hardened CIA agent by the name of Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland who does his usual grizzled mysterious government authority figure routine but in a stupendous manner) who has spent his life hunting the Jackal and the series of events which follow will captivate anyone who watches this film - it is chock full of great acting without all the usual action film cliches and one-liners and a great plot which will surprise anyone. The three leading men - Quinn Sutherland and Kingsley - carry this film much further than its modest budget would have allowed with anyone else filling their shoes. Also kudos to the director and his staff the camera angles and cinematography are top notch especially in the action scenes. The Assignment is better than anyone renting it could ever expect its a pity the film did fairly poorly in the box office otherwise we might see a sequel to this stupendous espionage thriller.<br /><br /> 9/10 stars this reviewer HIGHLY recommends it to all potential viewers!',pos
'Universal studios. The name conjures up so many memories to horror fans of beautiful matte paintings...er...landscapes fog-enshrouded countrysides full moons howling wolves taverns and torch wielding mobs. Yet it is quite strange looking back on those films how little the era which produced the true classics lasted. The 30s had its masterpieces but those were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today. The 40s produced more mindlessly fun matinée films than it did high art and most fans agree that the classic era of the Gothic horror films ended in 1945 with House of Dracula bumped around with the Abbott & Costello comedies and was officially dead by the 50s and the coming of the Atomic Age.<br /><br />So its strange that perhaps one of Universals finest Gothics was made in the 50s! That alone makes the film an oddity since costume dramas were on their way out EVERYWHERE. It may not be comparable to the all time classics like the James Whale films and The Wolfman but damn does it condense all the fun elements of those films into one delicious treat! Get ready for nothing but pure entertainment! Since various social mores had changed the film also indulges in violence that would not have been allowed in earlier eras; theres no blood but we see characters shot and stabbed directly and theres even a burning torch to the face!<br /><br />The film may not really be a horror film but it sure has the atmosphere look and feel of one! It begins in the dead of night with howling winds(and wolves) as two men seal the tombs of two apparently dead young lovers BUT WAIT! One of them is not dead but he cant move! Hes trapped but talking silently in his own mind unable to communicate! What is his story? Now THAT is how you start a horror film....<br /><br />English businessman Sir Ronald Burton(Richard Greene giving one of his best performances)sets out under the alias of Richard Beckett to investigate the disappearance of two friends of his who disappeared at the castle of one-eyed Austrian Count Von Bruno(Did Sacha Baron Cohen see this?). It seems many years ago Von Bruno posed as a god to the natives in Africa to steal ivory he was exposed by Burtons men and the natives disfigured him. Now he is lusting for revenge.<br /><br />The film has all the clichés a Jonathan Harker-style ride to the castle an inn full of wary villagers death traps and a hulking manservant(Lon Chaney Jr.). The torture chamber scenes are genuinely suspenseful including a panel in the floor that activates a dungeon door(which makes for an ingenious getaway scene later on) a hunting expedition involving an imported panther(!!!??)and even an alligator pit! And then theres the Romeo & Juliet-style fake death that leads to the films prologue....<br /><br />The plot is cliché and the world-view is black and white. But its still incredibly entertaining with director Nathan Juran making every scene pile on the atmosphere and seem fresh and new. there are several plot-holes too. Why does Ronald attempt to leave the castle so early? And he never does solve the mystery of what happened to his friends even though its obvious but he doesnt know that when he gives up and he seemed so sure earlier. Weird.<br /><br />All of the actors are great. Despite being a rude upperclassman Richard Greene makes Burton one of the most likable protagonists Ive ever seen in a horror film. Rita Corday is excellent as the Counts peasant wife who becomes Burtons love interest she may have the stereotypical falling in love with just a glance problem of all film heroines of this era but her portrayal of a long-suffering woman in a loveless marriage to a sadistic monster is very convincing she also shows a suspicion and wit few film heroines of this era do even seeing a forced attempt by Burton to quiet her(And to paw at her necklace although it is simply to analyze it as it has an important clue) as a rape attempt yet she never seems nasty in her paranoia the audience sympathizes with her. Even though he fails to make Von Bruno seem truly foreign and otherworldly(he is a villain in a horror film after all) Stephen McNally gives a truly chilling performance as the sadistic nobleman. When he reveals his burnt eye and laughs maniacally it is truly scary. Lon Chaney Jr. is also great as his mute henchman Gargon.<br /><br />But the best performance is undeniably by Boris Karloff as the mysterious physician Dr. Meissen. He has little screen time at first but steals every scene he is in. It is a performance that is both creepy sad mysterious and ultimately heroic. As he leers evilly as he applies leeches to one of Brunos henchman spies on our hero and speaks in that famous You know Im up to no good voice only Karloff could make you wonder whether if he is a hero or villain always skulking about. And although he does function as the main agent of our heros escape he still shows human frailties such as greed and fearfulness for his own life even cold-bloodedly poisoning a man for Burtons benefit before he even gets Burton to agree. His plan to help our hero & heroine escape also puts them directly in the clutches of Von Bruno as he arranges an amazingly sadistic(If unbelievably flawed)death for them that had to have inspired similar scenes in Cormans Poe series. He may not have much screen time but this is easily one of Boriss best performances.<br /><br />While the ending may seem abrupt and anti-climatic for some half the fun is getting there and theres much excitement to be had. Kick back and relive the days when Heroes were heroes and Villains were villains. Its no masterpiece but its escapist fun at its best.',pos
'Despite its ultra low budget Sorte Nula is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. And I must say a well deserved success. What I love about Sorte Nula the most is the intricate detail that Fernando Fragata went to keep you interested as to what is going on and just what will happen next. Its very detailed and superbly advanced for a seemingly simple love-story-gone-bad thriller. Whats even more enjoyable and ironic about this is the fact that the characters are in the same situation not one of them knows the entire story and are left to their own assumptions making Sorte Nula a cut above the rest. This is definitely not a film you want to walk out on for a bathroom break as you will undoubtedly miss something important. I feel one of the films major attributes would have to be the environment that it establishes. Its creepy but hilarious at the same time. I read somewhere someone quoting this film by saying ...its was like watching Hitchcock... and I couldnt agree more!! I love movies like that where you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING in order to fully understand what is going on. 9/10',pos
'I liked this movie a lot. It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends over such a tragedy. Alicia was just a troubled soul and Deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot. My only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things. Other than that it was great.',pos

The whole thing is terribly episodic in nature. <br /><br />Jim Carrey didnt bother to bring his A material he just seems bored and slightly ashamed of the whole thing. But heck when youre getting paid $20 million plus why bother. Tea Leoni is frantic. I guess I would be frantic not to get blamed for this flop.<br /><br />Theres just something sort of off about Dick & Jane. Carrey and Leoni arent funny and have little chemistry. The script isnt funny. And its not well-plotted.<br /><br />But it may be bigger than that. The reality of Dick and Jane is perhaps a little too real. Maybe its just not funny for people to lose their jobs in an Enron-like situation when real-life still lacks a happy ending.',neg
'I tired on several attempts to sit down and watch this program Gilmore Girls. It baffled me for I just couldnt put my finger on what this was about. Was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up? Was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother? Was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What the heck is this show about? Finally I just didnt care. The cast makes me want to scream. The writing is neither smart or intelligent its syrupy and tedious.<br /><br />So why did I watch? Because I heard SO many good things about this and I am not one to voice an opinion until I have watched. Knee-Jerk reactions are usually wrong so I watched a few times. The first time I watched this I saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40. Maybe that is what didnt attract me. I never liked any of the Freaky Friday films - not to say this is like that but there are some similarities. <br /><br />Also I have a friend who watches this show every week. So I asked her What is this show about? A very bright young lady usually articulate she never could give me a straight answer. So I asked others who rave about it - they really dont know either.<br /><br />Gilmore Girls is turning out to be a TV program thats like an art house movie. Many of us wont get it but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really isnt one just to be hip. Yes I find Lauren Grahams Lorelai annoying - whine whine nasally WHINE. A whole hour of that. Wow. And the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterdays cheese sandwich. The town is hokey the men are wimps the grand parents are boring and sadly I find nothing redeeming about any of these characters or care about anything they do. Its like watching paint dry on the wall.',neg
'Man this is a hard DVD to come by. I could only find it on Region 2 a Spanish import and it was expensive.<br /><br />Was it worth it? Well yes. Not so much because its a masterpiece of film making though directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com read Robert but the DVD credits list Curt) or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries -- Elisha Cook Jr. and Thomas Gomez -- but because my decade-long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied.<br /><br />Essentially a respected but self-contained engineer (Alan Curtis) has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two show tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review. She accepts a little gloomily. The mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave.<br /><br />At the show the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger. The drummer in the band Cook leers at the silent lady but gets no response. Curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she wont give it and she doesnt want to know his. If shed been a Longfellow devotee shed have said something about ships that pass in the night.<br /><br />Okay Curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence. The head police officer Gomez turns him over to the DA. His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember -- not the bartender not the Latina star not the cab driver (Al Alp) not the drummer -- and since the lady herself has disappeared its impossible to dig her up.<br /><br />Curtis is convicted and sentenced to die. But Inspector Gomez has thought things over and decided hers probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story. He joins Curtiss loving secretary Ella Raines in re-investigating the case informally.<br /><br />They visit the supposed witnesses again. The ominous bartender is run over by a car perhaps accidentally so hes out of the picture. The hot-tempered Latina has left because the show closed and shes uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway. Elisha Cook Jr. is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group. His sweaty face assumes an expression which doesnt suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous orgasmic insanity. His eyeballs roll to the ceiling his mouth gapes his hammering becomes frenzied. I laughed out loud.<br /><br />Nobodys performance is otherwise outstanding but all are professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. Best performance though is probably by Franchot Tone. Hes the real murderer and he fakes his alibi. Hes reserved and artistic. Even when he faints hes decorous. I dont know how to put this precisely but Tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part. Alan Curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs in a B picture. <br /><br />I dont know why its considered as classic. Its really your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich not as good as some of his others. But Siodmaks direction is sensitive. A man gets run over and his hat winds up in a gutter with water running around it. His use of shadows is quietly effective.<br /><br />Glad I got it.',pos
'Normally I do not review online but its Saturday and Im trapped in my room on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I cant get the damned Joxer the Mighty song out of my head its been there for the past ten years or so just pops up randomly when someone(me) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie and actually post them on the internet do you have ANY idea how much of an idiot you look like? If you expect more out of Bruce Campbell than what he puts out (in the most literal sense) than why in G-ds holy name do you watch his movies? No one watches a Bruce Campbell movie when they want to see something genius and intelligible we watch them so we feel better about ourselves (like those people who watch Jerry Springer and eat Chunky Monkey) and to be easily entertained by mindless psycho-babble. I personally love Bruce Campbell movies. Im not a complete idiot in fact I see myself as an intellectual and a scholar(haha shut up Ally). His movies reflect insane random quirky ridiculous ideals which anyone with a brain screaming or no can enjoy. That and he was kind of sexy on Xena: Warrior Princess even with the facial hair. I rate this movie an excellent 10 just because I can. If you cant take simplistic plot-schemes (if any) hot babes in sci-fi splendor(leather spandex) and familiar if not exhausted views of insanity then fer cryin out loud dont watch the movie(or any that so much as mention the name Bruce Campbell). Oh yeah Ted Raimi was awesome in this movie! Way to go Ted! You did the best with what you had. ;|',pos
'I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night. Its an amazing movie. A very disturbing one at that.<br /><br />In a way Zero Day is very comparable to The Blair Witch Project. Its shot completley with handheld camcorders. Its about 2 kids. Just your average kids. Andre and Calvin. They start a campaign against there High School entitled Army of 2.<br /><br />The whole story is told in Video Diary form from the 2 kids. It shows there relationships with there parents amongst other people showing that these are just normal kids just like people we know or who have bumped into. We find out The Army of 2s last mission will be entitles Zero Day. They plan to shoot up there High School.<br /><br />You see how they get access to there guns how they plan it out everything. They stress that the media has not affected them at all and there is no reason for doing this. Like I said this is all told in Video Diary form and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after Zero Day.<br /><br />The actual shooting is shown through Survillence Cameras throughout the school. Chilling indeed. The movie is very chilling. Some of the things they say how they plan it out youd just have to see it for yourself. One quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is byhimself. He says Andre thinks were just gonna leave in some getaway car doing this to numerous schools across the country. I dont know what hes thinking but the only way Im coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag.<br /><br />Im probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film. You really need to see it yourself. Its going around festivals right now.<br /><br />A+.',pos
'This movie is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest repute) who are heading to a small fort to take over a recently departed uncles property where they plan to set up shop. Upon arrival in a nearby city they find no one will go there (even though its only 15 miles away) so they walk. When they get there they find there are no soldiers but a good amount of people who have taken over use of the fort and built up a small city nearby. They soon find that something isnt right here and Fort McMillan (Ft. Doom as the locals call it) is in some serious trouble. <br /><br />Rather than go into the plot line I will make some comments about things I noticed about the movie. First off the acting is very flat only a few of the people seem to be real enough to believe in. My first though was poor acting but at the end I watched some of the outtakes and these same people became alive. So my only thought left is this is how the director wanted it. On top of the bad acting I have a great problem where the people dont react right to a given set of circumstances. Take for example no one would take them to Ft McMillan for any price even though its only 15 miles away. Yet when we arrive at the Fort we find it is well maintained by a decent population of people all of whom must get supplies from some one not to mention mail etc. It is supposed to take place in 1867 yet we can see the railroad car has electric lights (they arent on at least) and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later not one of the general style of locomotives so popular at that time. There are also places where you can see paved blacktop (and maybe a car at one point didnt want to bother to go back and look) and other anachronistic items. If they had followed the rules of the world they made and let the actors be actors it might have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 I gave it and they rewritten it about 4 more times it might have done even better.',neg
'First off this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the Sci-Fi Channel has produced; that isnt to say that Grendel is a good film in fact it is very bad but it definitely had potential to be a lot better. The flaws of the film come from character design character absurd additions to the story the visual effects the music and for the most part: the acting.<br /><br />When speaking of character design I of course mean the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem like ridiculous Vikings rather than warriors of brute strength -- that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly. Grendel looks like the Hulk but with strange tentacle-attachments to his elbows.<br /><br />The characters are very limited. Beowulf is same from beginning to end however Finn -- a useless sidekick -- achieved some two-dimensionality due thanks to his romantic subplot and Unferth gets some notion as well as he becomes less conceited.<br /><br />Much like Finn there are useless additions to this story to make it its own while still holding to the source material. The crossbow that is gifted to Beowulf is so ridiculous Im surprised the cast didnt walk off the set. Besides additions theres omissions such as the underlying themes of Christianity and Paganism as well as the consequences of lying.<br /><br />The special effects are mighty terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly conceived and as such theyre portrayal on screen is less than believable.<br /><br />The music is overbearing especially when a character dies.<br /><br />All in all this is not Sci-Fis worst film to date. No. It is actually one of the better films though trash it still it is it is good trash making it a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue which is still wooden here and there.<br /><br />I highly recommend you skip this film and watch Robert Zemeckis take on the ancient story of Beowulf simply because this film (Grendel) is only half the tale and not the whole thing which garners this movie a three-star review.',neg
'Beforehand Notification: Im sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here but when I saw the preview for this movie I was thinking Finally! I have yet to see one movie about popular African-influenced dance (be it popular hip hop moves breaking or stepping) where the main character was a Black woman. Ive seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-Black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it (Breakin Breakin 2 Save the Last Dance Step Up) but the Black women in the film are almost nonexistent. That always bothered me considering so much of hip hop African-influenced dance and breaking was with Blacks and Latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasnt always men who performed it so I felt this movie has been a long time coming. However the race does not make the film so I also wanted it to carry a believable plot; the dancing be entertaining; and interesting to watch.<br /><br />Pros: I really enjoyed this film bringing Jamaican culture. I cant recall ever seeing a popular mainstream film where all the main characters were Jamaican; had believable accents; and werent stereotypical with the beanies. The steppers family friends and even the thugs were all really intelligent realistic people who were trying to love live and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive. Even when the audience was made aware that the main characters sister chose an alternate lifestyle it still didnt make the plot stereotypical. I was satisfied with the way it was portrayed. I LOVED the stepping; the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers; the trials that the main characters parents were going through; and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with Crabs in a Barrel. I respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world. They were all just as excellent as the fellas. I dont see that in too many movies nowadays at least not those that would be considered Black films.<br /><br />Cons: Im not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this but I question whether theyve been to real step shows. Whenever the steppers got ready to perform some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers hand/feet beats. At a real step show there is zero need for music other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups. And then when hip hop songs were played sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers hands and feet. It was awkward. I was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus Stomp the Yard (another great stepping movie) because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys (in Stomp the Yard Meagan Good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the (Deltas?) let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately). Even when there were very small scenes the ladies tore it up especially in the auto shop and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music. I know soundtracks have to be sold but the movie folks couldve played the music in other parts of the film.<br /><br />Im not a Keyshia Cole fan so every time I saw her all I kept thinking was Is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks? She looked uncomfortable on screen to me. I thought they shouldve used a host like Free or Rocsi instead. Deray Davis was funny as usual though. Also I groaned when I found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto like stepping couldnt possibly happen anywhere else. Hollywood as usual. However only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers which mainstream movies tend to do.<br /><br />I wouldve given this movie five stars but the music playing killed it for me. I definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs.',pos
'im not even sure what to say about this film. its one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic. to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa like dancing about architecture. it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again. this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie Adaptation wanted to write. the ending is left open and ambiguous no happy ending here just mystery. no profound life lessons just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings...... romantic love.<br /><br />10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger................',pos
'This delightful well written film is based on a New York stage play bearing the same title where Sir Aubrey (knighted Sir Charles Aubrey Smith in 1944) originated the role he plays in the film. Here in 1931 we see him in the early part of his acting renaissance in the very early era of talkies and in the character role that he would make his own until his death in 1948 after finishing his last performance in Little Women which released in 1949.<br /><br />This engaging play is about an elderly British aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them having brought them to his manor in England.<br /><br />Marion Davies plays his daughter-by-error and its a tour de force for her. She is all at once endearing impatient shallow enchanting wise and compassionate while creating an indelible and beguiling character that remains well ensconced in the memory.<br /><br />The 26 year old Ray Milland appears here in a small but prominent role having already appeared in seven other pictures then only in films for a bit more than two years.<br /><br />The film should be enjoyed as a representative of 1931 Hollywood factory production of course and as such is not flawless. However its a charming pleasure from first scene to the last.',pos

David Duchovny is just plain hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with David Allen Grier Carol OConnor Robert Loggia Joley Richardson and Jim Belushi you have a Oscar worthy movie! Im surprised they didnt get one. if you havent seen it go rent the DVD watch it once then put directors commentary on...Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!',pos
'What a poor image of Professional Police Officers is displayed on the Television in the watching of this alleged Reality show. One can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a stop  then the Pat Down of the outside of ones Garment then to be able to articulate why the officer went into someones pocket and retrieved contraband was cut out of the scenes because if it wasnt the arrest in most places are going to be tossed should they even get passed a supervisor. A report of a warrant over the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the person dispatching has the original warrant in hand. If the dispatcher is reading from a computer printout it is good enough for an arrest but it does not necessarily mean the warrant is still in effect. Since I havent seen a Dis-claimer from CBS (I may have missed it) CBS could be in trouble.',neg
'It probably isnt fair that I have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the Sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten but oh well.......<br /><br />From a standpoint of acting how could any actor fail with these characters? Each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life. Tony Soprano-while a mob Capo and suffering from mental illness still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive. Each of his men you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism. It definitely brings out a sort nosey side in each and every viewer and I include myself in this!<br /><br />While some above dont care for Bracco I have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since Good Fellas. She is the side of Tony that makes him listen to reason that makes him decent that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long if ever. She is simply put his savior. (Not speaking in religious tones)<br /><br />But the knockout performance here is without doubt Edie Falco. To see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed HBO series Oz and then see her as Livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress. She has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress something only actresses like Merle Streep can get away with. A sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles. But as I have mentioned before with a characters a strong as these how can any actor fail?<br /><br />Livias strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself. She is a survivor as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors. She is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husbands business yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from Jersey. She is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then Tony himself.<br /><br />All in all the biggest crime from the Soprano Family is that we the viewer have to wait until January 2000 to see the next season. This in my opinion is the worst thing about the HBO series. It was what brought The Larry Sanders Show Sex and the City Dream On and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them. Too much space in between seasons and very sporadic. Until then I will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled.',pos
'Clair Denis again revisits her theme of estranged fathers men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion heedless of the emotion toll on their family but while Nénette and Boni from the earlier film live in a narrow world of Marseilles our examination of Louis Trebor in The Intruder takes us from a remote location along the French-Swiss border to half way around the world to Korea and Tahiti. Again the film begins in mid stream with Louis in his sixties coping with an ailing heart while attempting to maintain a high level of fitness. We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence. Louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby. Denis is in no hurry to move the action along and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son Sidney (Grégoire Colin almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp of a mustache) who rejects him as a lunatic: shown as a dedicated father of two. There are many brief scenes which while seemingly unrelated build up an impression of Louis and his milieu. Ms Godards camera work is exhilarating here. The controlling metaphor is Louiss heart transplant for which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to search for another son not found and where Louiss new heart rejects him just as Sidney rejected the old. We are accustomed to brief scenes in Deniss film which are inexplicable: Nénette astride Boni feeding with a spoon; a drive by shooting of Bonis father and then the briefest of images of Boni with a gunshot wound in the head; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of Sidney. The implication of the last two is a rejection real or imagined by a father kills something indefinable in a son.',pos
'The Dentist was made on the time when almost every profession had its psycho. We had mad police officers ambulance men secreterys and that was just for starters. The Dentist came suprisingly late because going to dentist is usually everymans nightmare.<br /><br />The plot is twisted. Super clean dentist Doctor Feinstone lives perfect life in his great white house he has beautiful blond wife and great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of nasty IRS guy (Terminators Earl Boen) dirty pool cleaner cleaning his wife and suddenly everyones teeth seems to have gone through dark filter. He goes nutso and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way. And you dont want to come to his path.<br /><br />Crew were professional. Producer/director Brian Yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator and his first movie Society was nice spinoff from John Carpenters They Live. Films producer Pierre David is known from movies like Scanners. Cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really suprised me. I knew him from LA Law and Major League but I could newer dream him as a psycho dentist. He was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person. Linda Hoffman was beutiful and dumb as Feinstones wife. Micahel Stadvec did not have much lines but after I saw him with ladies of the neighbourhood I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead From Beyond) was nice sight as cop on the case. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teen who is about to be next client to Feinstone.<br /><br />Final warning: If youre like me and have problem with dentists then maybe you should skip this one. But if you want to try than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lots nasty drillings.',pos

'Have just seen the last episode No 32 (though the site says only 30 episodes were made) and I must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime/cop stories. Supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes this has at times been a gritty well acted believable and dare I say entertaining series. The fact that the powers in Denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least never failed to get their man! Its a definite 10/10 for me.',pos
'This movie includes 2 well known actors I have previously enjoyed watching. There actions are great and each action is heart felt. But it makes me think these 2 were thrown into a speech/drama class at college for the first time and told for one to act dominating and constricting to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind-humping to drive the audience into tears for her release.<br /><br />The only good part IS the acting abilities the plot has the same ruse as Hitlers influence and I started to hate the protagonist for that. But all of this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion so to drag it out for over an hour was just pure punishment for all who watched it.<br /><br />',neg
'The movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl (Im sorry Im biased i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies) and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than Azumi 1. I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. I amazed myself being able to sit through it. <br /><br />Lets talk about the plus points of the movie. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. Thats all there is to salvage the whole movie. The fact is if the main character was male i am sure that most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. <br /><br />Now lets talk about the minus points. Firstly it is real draggy with lots and lots of repeated scenes. Scenes of Nachi and Azumi keeps coming back. It seems more like a drama way of shooting. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks and this movie too. Secondly the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting. I do not mind unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs etc... it reminds me of Shinobi though Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. Moreover to portray i-dont-know what effect the director films people dying with blood spraying (literally) all around... people not realizing their head was cut off... etc.. etc... etc... Too many of these spoils the show. It seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie. It degrades the show greatly. Thirdly Isnt Azumi supposed to be an assassin. She seems more like an one-man-army to me just that she is a female. I dont think you see assassins charging into army camps. The only time i felt she acted assassin-liked was when she killed the Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Lastly the plot was thin in both movies. Its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way.',neg
'This rendition of Noahs Ark has set Hallmarks (and Turners) reputation back about 100 years. However the production has its bright side...a learning experience for neophyte movie entrepreneurs in how not to make a movie<br /><br />Where in the annals of Biblical literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations:<br /><br />Ok boys lets saddle up. Its too bad that God created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night. Were not kissing...were only whispering in each others mouths.<br /><br />Lumber for building the Ark with Georgia Pacific stamped on it. Metal nails. Kids flying kites. A peddler (how can James Coburn sleep after this) selling Chinese hats. Pirates attacking a wooden Ark which they wished to capture with flaming tar balls of fire shot from catapults. Glass bottles of wine (Noah was in a continual state of inibriation. It was a miracle that he could see the Ark let alone build it.) Lady Godiva (Mary Steenberg in a blond wig tromping around the Ark on a white horse...still rated G) Warding off Biblical pirates with an iron (teflon-lined?) frying pan. Landing on Mount Ararat after having passed through the Straights of Hercules.<br /><br />etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />Special effects...youve got to see them in order not to believe them.<br /><br />The list goes on. This movie must not be missed; but if you want the full TV version you must call NBC for the screen version...but only if you agree to absolve NBC of all responsibility of ever having aired the thing in the first place. Only the expurgated version exists in video stores (no pirates etc.)...that is those video stores that dare to stock it.<br /><br />Marvin Cohn<br /><br />',neg
'Comes this heartwarming tale of hope. Hope that youll never have to endure anything this awful again. *cough* Razzie award *cough*<br /><br />I disliked this movie because it was unfunny predictable and inane. While watching I felt like I was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained. When I requested my money back at the end of the movie I was informed that because I watched the whole thing I wasnt entitled to reimbursement. I was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though.<br /><br />The movie summary is pretty basic. The midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police. Underneath this clever outline however lies a repertoire of original fresh and hilarious skits. Or not.<br /><br />Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people getting hit by pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think babies say goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa? Do you drool?<br /><br />If you answered yes to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you. Although it has been billed in some places as The Worst Movie of the Decade there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse...somewhere. I cant say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldnt be taken seriously. <br /><br />This lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. Save your money for something funny.<br /><br />Respect',neg

'Well as you can see I got to this party quite late but have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments. I found this site by happen chance when I was looking for other Marine Corps films. So let me start by telling you that I played a Marine Boot in the movie Pvt. Labarsky and was stationed at MCRDep San Diego at the time. Jack Webb and his crew selected 15 Permanent Personnel of which some of us had the speaking parts and another 15 Marines that had just completed Boot Camp. That made up the Platoon and the Marines who portrayed the various DIs. To the best of my recollection The Capt. and Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) were not in the Marines. We spent about three weeks up in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot) CA shooting the section of the movie that we were involved with and then they completed the other shots after we left.<br /><br />So as I ramble along here let me clarify some of what has been questioned in previous entries as best I can. Cuff Daddy was commenting about the ability of our Platoon to yell Yes Sir without moving and etc Yes we did the yelling for the Sound Guys and it was while shooting the scene. As you fellow Marines remember when the DI or who ever started to ask a question and before they completed it you had already taken your breath of air enabling you to yell at the top of your lungs the proper response. That is how it was done.<br /><br />74Sooner commented about walking through the same building at Paris Island however as I mentioned earlier all the scenes were shot in Studio City CA . They were built from photos taken at Paris Island and from on site trips and Marine advisers from Paris Island. Sorry you were in the real buildings not the sets.<br /><br />schappe1 brought up many good points but about the incident with the platoon at Paris Island at the time all that jack Webb said to us was The movie came about because of the accident and the Marine Corps didnt want to put out anything that would impact any of the family members of the Marines that died that night. Although the Marine Corps would provide any Marines and assistance needed for a movie answering to the public why a Marine DI does what he does.<br /><br />As mentioned by a few of you I also at the time we were shooting the scenes caught my self thinking this dialog has been cleaned up to much and obviously isnt how it goes down in real life. Back in the 50sthat is how it had to be done.<br /><br />One story I would like to pass on is about the interaction that occurred between us Marines and the Movie Crew and between the Movie Crew and Jack Webb. From the start by custom the Marines replied Yes Sir to anybody that moved. Going into the second week it was getting more common to hear Yes Sir coming from all directions. On stage someone would bark out a request for something to be done with the lighting and from out of nowhere up on a catwalk above the set a reply of Yes Sir would sound out. To all of this at one of our informal gatherings Jack Webb stated. If I had known that I would have gotten this much respect from this crew I would have brought you guys up here years ago. There was a Lt. brought up from San Diego to play the role of the DI from the other platoon and the one Jack Webb fights with but during one shooting secessions He was up to take number 32 and still Webb kept trying to work him through how he wanted it done and didnt show any lack of patience with him. The next day they used the Paris Island adviser who was a DI Sgt. from Paris Island and He worked out fine.<br /><br />At the time I was somewhat of a camera buff and got to know the Still Camera Man to get some pointer from him and as it turned out He would give me still shots and some of the 35mm film of the daily shooting that were not going to be used. Those film strips I cut up and made slides out of them. After the movie came out in VHS tape (The DI 11706 B&W/106 min.) my kids and the grand kids have a blast when they try to se who can find me the most times on the screen.',pos
'I got to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was uber cute and I mean uber cute. It had all the sex content that most Ivan Reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene . Both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you cant feel your face anymore. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each others roles perfectly and even Wanda Sykes rather small role will keep you laughing. Though these kind of comedies arent for everybody but I have to say I went with a person that doesnt usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy. This movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children since some moments are little too...well lets say ADULT for younger viewers. All in all I was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending I found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2* out of 5*)',pos

It is an explosion of artistic talent color and sound. I dont know if I should calls it circus dance or both. It is bigger than life itself. They will only be able to do this well for just a few brief years in their life. These are the performers for the performers.

'I had seen The Cure when I was a kid and I loved it then. Now years later I got a hold of a copy almost by accident and watched it again. Being a kid you dont really have the ability to procure things for yourself that you want that is usually a prerogative of your parents - but when I watched it again now I felt sorry that I did not do more to get a copy of this movie back then and consequently almost forgot about it until today.<br /><br />This really is a beautiful movie. It tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard-edged misfit kid - who takes his cues from his horrible abusive mother - and his neighbor a slightly younger boy who has AIDS.<br /><br />Right you say. Another one of those. A tear jerker. A bucket movie. A morality tail. Yeah I know I hate those too. Only this one isnt. It is one of the very few movies among those many I have seen that pulls off a very rare trick: it conveys a truly sad story (and yes a morality tale) but without a single moment where it feels cheesy forced or in any other way hollywoody. It shows a REAL relationship between two REAL boys who interact as REAL kids do. And through that interaction the good-natured loving character of the older boy Eric starts to shine through his tough-guy persona as he takes on a kind of big-brotherly care for Dexter his HIV-positive younger neighbor. Together they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which to Erik seems to be just around the corner - so that all this silly AIDS thing will go away and they can be friends forever.<br /><br />The production is top notch. But of course what really carries this movie is the performances of the two leads - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Especially Mazzello who is simply stunning - he does convey a sense of frailty needed for an ailing boy but at the same time he manages to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined character. He shines at the scene where the boys confront Pony: his impulse to protect his older friend lunges him forth drives him to say what he says - and only afterwards the horror is depicted on his face as he realizes that what he himself said is true: his blood is poison... Renfro also has his moments in particular the scenes with his mother: he depicts perfectly how this macho street-wise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive storming mother and cant get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives a memorable performance as Dexters mother who ultimately becomes in a sense a mother figure to Erik as well.<br /><br />Ive first seen this film when I was at school back in America and loved it - not at all a given concerning movies of this sort. But the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real I could easily relate to them. Ironically enough the teacher who had shown us this movie (a wonderful woman Im still in touch with her) got in trouble for it as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a Playboy... Pathetic. Seriously will Americans ever get over this ridiculous phobia I do not know. There was a hardly-distinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools... how sad. Kids need to see this movie. It is more inspiring and educational than all the official after-school specials put together.<br /><br />Oh and one more thing. I know Im rambling but nevertheless... The score. Its great. I am a musician and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well known Jazz pianist and record producer. Up until this movie I really did not know that he did movie scores as well even though when I later checked I found out that I had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on. Really a wonderful job there.<br /><br />All in all a solid Ten. Id recommend this movie to anyone. And Im definitely going to see it with my younger siblings - they can use watching a film like this among all the standard special-effect hysteria they usually see.',pos

'Why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers? That point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie.<br /><br />I think sports movies fall into two categories; well made movies about the human spirit and competitions and `By the Sword.<br /><br />Honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be a touching drama for trying to be your best in life an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick. In the end it didnt do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it.<br /><br />For the record I also am a fencing instructor (and now I am officially as bad as the rest). But putting bad fencing in a movie doesnt make it bad automatically. I mean look at Star Wars (Episodes 4-6 good movies bad fencing). I liked those movies. But when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the purists that think it a lame effort.<br /><br />Dont be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fencing. This is just a bad movie. In the end this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells.<br /><br />When I see a movie and am forced to think `Man I wish I was watching the Mighty Ducks.

'The Bourne Ultimatum begins recklessly mid-chase and in pulse-pounding fashion explodes from there as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon absolutely superb) tracks down the masterminds behind the CIA black-ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity. A devastatingly icy David Strathairn as the man behind the curtain is added to the returning cast of regulars including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent).<br /><br />Like the second entry in the series I wished Paul Greengrass shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime. However that being said its a perfect way to capture the tense claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. The Bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic. It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time but Ill be damned if it isnt a blast to watch them get there.<br /><br />With the absence of the emotive and involving Franka Potente the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything. Still this can be forgiven for unlike the Identity and the Supremacy this Ultimatum reveals all and we finally learn the truth about Bournes past. Its an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series and if they have any good sense and Damon gets his wish this will be the perfect end to it.',pos
'Quite liked Flesh and looking forward to Heat but couldnt help but feel Morrissey grossly exploited most of the performers featured here. Stumbling around naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all Dallesandro was capable of in this feature--a huge and heartbreaking contrast from Flesh. His semi-erection in a few scenes is the only indication that he might be acting; mostly it looks like something he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation all right--she is the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But hers is a one woman show--she rarely engages the other performers though it has to be said her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shade when it comes to cinematic displays of raw passion. When she pounces on a young would-be lover it is with the ferocity of a vampire. Two of the female performers Andrea and Jane have such annoying voices youll have to mute the sound to get through their scenes. The fact that several of these performers committed suicide or were murdered a few years after only adds to the air of exploitation.

'Not as bad as youve heard. There are actually some funny parts and Affleck and Applegate have fairly good chemistry. Applegate in particular is appealing and likable as Afflecks love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine OHara are consummate professionals. Theyre pretty good in just about everything. In the end Surviving is not the worst holiday movie youll ever see. <br /><br />Unfortunately it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced. The attempts at dark humor come off as dour. Affleck tries hard to be endearingly spastic and overenthusiastic but comes across as disturbed. His characters cartoonish nature is brought into high relief when viewed next to Gandolfini and OHaras more muted believable performances. Even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies you never fully buy into the set-up of Affleck renting this family for X-mas.<br /><br />There are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangeness. The X-mas eve scene replete with incestuous humor (a son being discovered looking at naked provocative pictures of his mother) that not only isnt funny or believable but disturbing.<br /><br />To make matters worse the colors in this film are muddy almost noirish. The house set on which most of the movie takes place looks stagey and cheap.<br /><br />Surviving is mostly of interest as the fourth in a string of box office duds (Paycheck Gigli Jersey Girl and this) for Affleck. It remains to be seen how lasting the damage will be.',neg
'I wish I could use the time travel machine to jump back to the moment I considered seeing this movie and make other plans instead. I saw a free screening of A Sound of Thunder so I cant complain about the price but I wish I could get my 103 minutes refunded. The acting was mediocre and the special effects were deplorable. People shouldnt make movies about dinosaurs if they cant afford to make the prehistoric creatures look as good or better than those in Jurassic Park. Spielberg spoiled us. Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the movies only saving grace. I noticed that females under 18 rated the movie the highest and the only explanation is that they ogled over Burns the whole time. The whole long 103 minutes. This movie should have been over in about 80 minutes. It just dragged on and on and on. Dont waste your time or your money on this far-fetched flick.',neg
'I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager I think (Im 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments I had NO idea it was shown at theatres or that anyone else even new it existed. I dont think Ive even mentioned the movie to anyone else.<br /><br />But half a lifetime later I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago. I think the innocence of the charactors their situation their mutual affection over a long period of time left a long term imprint for reasons I dont quite understand. Maybe it is because I was a teenager at the time I saw it and it touched me somehow..... I really dont know! I also REALLY wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened. Oh the agony!!<br /><br />Ive not seen it before or since but I would love to. I keep a casual look out for it but I now doubt it will been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion. But Id proberbly miss it in the TV guide even if it DID show up. Pssttt!!!<br /><br />Reading the reviews here has renewed my interest. If anyone knows of its availability in Australia by all means email me and let me know.<br /><br />Oh and Sean Bury... nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here. Ive had a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a James Bond film. What are you up to these day? Oh and do YOU have a copy of the film? CHEERS!!!',pos
'Doyle had never wanted to resurrect Holmes from his joint death with Professor Moriarty in THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL PROBLEM. Howeverfinancial considerations made him willing (in 1901) to write THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES which is still considered his best Holmes novel and possibly his best novel. But it was a memoir of the great detective written before his death. Only a greater outcry from his public led Doyle to fully resurrect Holmes in THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE published in 1905.<br /><br />It is not that the new short stories (and the last novel) are really bad. Maybe three of the stories are really terrible but even the terrible ones are very readable. Several of the later ones (like THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST) are really very good. But the unevenness of production (in particularly after the stories in HIS LAST BOW (1917)) become increasingly apparent. He repeats past story lines and he shows really negative aspects of Holmes. In the story THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GABLES Holmes shows a sneering sarcasm at a character who is of African ancestry. <br /><br />SPOILER COMING UP:<br /><br />THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON deals with Holmes trying to recover compromising letters from Milverton a hugely successful blackmailer. It is an interesting example of how Doyle could make a highly readable story with a minimum of plot for there is little real detective work in the tale. Holmes is hired to try to negotiate with Milverton regarding the purchase of the letters but to get them back no matter what! Milverton proves not only unwilling to consider a smaller amount for the papers but prepared to protect himself from Holmes attempting a search of his person. Later we learn Holmes has gotten into the household of Milverton by romancing a maid while disguised. At the end Holmes goes with Watson to burglarize Milvertons home. He and Watson are in the house when they find that Milverton is awaiting some new business deal in his study (someone with information that Milverton can use). Carefully hiding Holmes and Watson watch as a woman comes in who turns out to be a victim of collateral damage from Milvertons past activities and who shoots the blackmailer to death. Holmes and Watson are able to set fire to Milvertons collection of compromising documents before fleeing the house and subsequently discover (for themselves) the identity of the woman. The police (under Lestrade) dont discover who the two mysterious men seen running from Milvertons home are and they are so disgusted by Milvertons activities (they never were able to bring anything home against him) that it is obvious the murder will never be solved.<br /><br />The tale is not one of the fascinating ones with real detective work involved like THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND or SILVER BLAZE. It is a tale of mood and late action - the issue being will Holmes and Watson get the papers or will they be caught by Milverton? It is not one of the best stories but it is in the bulk of the tales as being really well told and interesting.<br /><br />At the time he wrote CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON Conan Doyle had an experience with the police regarding his sometimes activities as a highly respected amateur detective/crusader. An artist was found murdered in his studio in London and Conan Doyle began writing his opinions about how the killing was committed. Then he stopped - apparently warned by his friends at Scotland Yard that the murder did not bare looking into. The victim had been a homosexual and the police were certain that it was a lovers spat gone horribly wrong. For the sake of the family of the Victim (this was in 1905) Doyle dropped his interest in the case. So he was aware that sometimes the British police behaved with restraint on matters that did not seem to justify their full probing - as Lestrades restraint towards whoever did kill the villainous Milverton in the story.<br /><br />Given the description of the story it could have been told in the normal hour long version of the series. But the teleplay for THE MASTER BLACKMAILER spent some time showing the horrible dilemma Milvertons victims (in Victorian/Edwardian England) faced. We see a promising young aristocratic army officer kill himself when faced with a homosexual exposure because of Milvertons extravagant demands all at the start of the teleplay. And it is not only homosexuals. Men and women of good reputation in heterosexual marriages could be smeared by uncovering illegitimate children or past indiscreet relationships. Indeed in the story the woman who kills Milverton is avenging the destruction of her husband (a prominent nobleman) destroyed by the blackmailer. <br /><br />Milverton is well played at his most poisonous blandness by that fine actor Robert Hardy who even when confronted by the unexpected furies he has unleashed is totally unperturbed (he looks like he will just have the angry woman showed out of his home in a moment). Brett and Hardwicke do quite well in their Holmes and Watson roles as to be expected.<br /><br />How serious was the loss of character by rumor or innuendo in 1905? In 1898 one of the heroes of the various imperial wars and the leader of the last victorious charge at the battle of Omdurman that destroyed the Mahdist army (see FOUR FEATHERS) was Sir Hector MacDonald. He was governor of Ceylon in 1903 when he suddenly unexpectedly resigned. Sir Hector returned to London and shot himself in a hotel while awaiting some sort of hearing. It later came out that Fighting Mac frequently considered the most popular army commander in Britain had been caught having sleeping arrangements with native boys. Milverton would have eaten him up very quickly...or his real life counterparts would have.',pos
'As a spiritualist and non Christian. I thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith but what a load of i seers. I thought the film would have great arguments but only got one sided views from Atheists and Jews??? And who are all these street people hes interviewing who dont know the back of their arm from their head. Where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from. Not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970. Personally this DVD was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti-Christ told me so. Please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding God because his own ego and demons got the better of him. No im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves.

'Even though this was a disaster in the box office It is my favorite film. It gives a powerful message of family. It has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. Compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian Godfather Amitabh portrays that in this film. Dont read reviews by critic theyre just ignorant. This movie has good mix of comedy romance drama and especially action. So if you want to see action more realistic than Main Hoon Na(still good movie) this is the movie.',pos

'Once again the posters lied to me.<br /><br />The marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content; explosive? When I read the synopsis for this movie I was expecting to see a townful of grotesques every man-jack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation; into such a den of vice would come the clean-shaven hero shining Gabriel. Instead the movie was the complete opposite of what I was led to expect.<br /><br />The first few minutes of the film showed us that Middletown is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can whether fiddling a little to make ends meet drinking to forget the pain or watching cock-fighting (chickens not penises) to while away the boredom. In other words the townspeople were desperately ordinary.<br /><br />The only (deliberate?) grotesque in the piece was Gabriel the brainwashed Presbyterian preacher played by Macfadyen whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury. If I were kind I would suggest that the Paisleyite rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately Brian Kirk is so inept a film-maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie leaving the audience to fret their way through eighty-plus minutes of dark hackneyed tedium. My only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of guess the accent broken up with rounds of spot the location. Are we surprised that Gaybo ends up stealing his brothers child and suffocating his father? Of course not; hes a bible-bashing preacher and therefore psychotic. All the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the end of the movie but I suspect that theyve just realised what a turkey theyve put their names to.<br /><br />The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission have a budget to spend but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise. The only kind thing I can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace Superman Returns as the worst film of 2006; one hell of an achievement.<br /><br />v1:20061114 v2:20080107',neg
'Edge of Madness is a tale about a woman in the 1800s who gets hand-picked by dirty Scotsman who cant keep his penis in his pants. He just so happens to have a younger brother who is against rape and kills him but continuously says it was an accident. This makes his wife go crazy she gets delusional and she takes the fall because she loves George too much.<br /><br />Like I said this type of thing has been done before. This is just more artistic because its Canadian and its an indie production done on a low-budget with hardly known actors (except that one kid from Lassie yea hes in it). I dunno whether this was going for Oscar bait but it was sure as hell boring. And this is based on a 40 page short story. Half of that short story is incorporated into this flick and Im glad. Otherwise Id bore to death. Unfortunately I had to watch it in my Media Fundamentals class and I had an assignment on it. Read the short story and compare and contrast the flick to the story. BORING.<br /><br />You know its harder to answer movie questions when you dont like the movie. Ah well I hope this is the last type of assignment me and my class get. For what its worth Annie Herron was totally hot she had a nice soft ass and I liked the nude parts of her in the movie.<br /><br />3/10 for boring Oscar bait performance and graphic sexuality..plus nudity.',neg
'Well well I had seen a lot of reviews on this one and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene. But this flick is a tough one. And I mean it by all ways. Its hard to find a copy because it was a low budget independent release and because MPAA was on the hunt for every copy on VHS it came out unrated but it had to be rated for the MPAA. So copies disappeared into the underground scene. All people involved in this flick never did anything else in the biz. So it made this flick unique. VHS copies almost never pop up on ebay or other sites and if they do you will pay over a 100$ to get one. But due US connections I was able to catch a release on DVD sold worldwide. Limited but it was to be a sort of official one. Now and then there are still some screenings of this splatterfest. But is it worth all the hype surrounding it? As said earlier it is a tough one to catch but also to sit through. There are gory killings there is necrophilia there is nudity but there is also a lot of talking between the coppers. And to be honest if you would like to see the movie in 5 minutes watch the ending its a flashback in the killers mind. The blood flows and indeed its a splatterfest but not the full 80 minutes splatter galore for 10 minutes. The quality of the movie is okay sound okay no hiss colors okay black is black and not blue as in many low budgets. Its okay to watch it but you never will be frightened but its one to watch with your friends having a beer and a pizza I guess. 555 naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.',neg
'This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed minimal romance involving sex a hero that can be identified with violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronsons plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesnt involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again. Rather you want to see Kersey in action and the storyline just juices it up. This is great stuff.',pos

'Simply put Oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It is filled with memorable songs - Food Glorious Food Oliver! Consider Yourself and Oom-Pah-Pah to name just a few - and equally memorable characters.<br /><br />The film is a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens classic novel and much like the story of Oliver Twist itself it is a perfect family film. There are some frightening moments - the villain Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed is scary enough on his own - but overall the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults.<br /><br />The story - which almost everyone is surely familiar with by now - revolves around a little orphan boy named Oliver and his life growing up in London. At first he lives in the workhouse with the rest of his fellow orphans but after daring to question Mr. Bumble the overseer he is sold to a family as a servant.<br /><br />After a series of mishaps and close shaves he meets the Artful Dodger - superbly played by a young Jack Wild who gives his all in the role - and through him the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody) who trains young boys to pick pocket treasures which he keeps for himself.<br /><br />The film was shot solely in studios and on soundstages at Shepperton Film Studios but this does not translate at all to film. The sets perfectly replicate Victorian London as do the costumes worn by the characters. A multi-Oscar winner and a massive success on its release Oliver! is a worthy contender for the best musical all of time and will delight anyone who loves film.',pos

Arghhhh! i mean it was just way too retardedit was like the writer didnt know where he wanted the story to go.(or he was a few minutes short of 80 min so he added some more retarded twists to the movie so people can get 80min worth of crap instead of 75min.<br /><br />what i didnt get was why didnt they just kill the damned thing while it was unconscious instead they just walked away from it like idiots and left it so it could come back and kill them. the only reason i gave it a 4 was because of the gore which was actually the only thing that i watched this movie to the end for that and to watch them all get killed.(no im serious)',neg
'In todays world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it. Movies like Psycho and Blair Witch while being great in suspense (both with great build ups) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them. With Mute Witness a rare treat I stumbled upon this film and watched it scared witless in the middle of the night. I was scared by the menacing Russian ambience the snuff theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the (amusing which always leads to likeable) characters could meet the end at any second. Since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations. It also has Fay Ripley in a rare movie role watch and prepare to be excited scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways.',pos

'I got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with Zombie Bloodbath as one of its alternative titles. Perversely this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other one is really bad! This film is pretty bad too; obviously you cant go into a film that calls itself Zombie Bloodbath and expect to see a masterpiece and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on display...but it all feels very old and tired which isnt helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line. Its just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc. The film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what youre in for; low quality zombie garbage. Theres plenty of gore in the film and its a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap too and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence seemed to be Romeros superior Day of the Dead although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore. It all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall I cant say I was impressed with it!',neg
'Everybody I talked to said that this movie would be good and really weird so I figured that I would rent it. Half way through the movie I was thinking to myself what the heck was going on and what is the point to this movie. This movie from start to finish is so bad that even the sick parts of the movie didnt even bother me. I mean what are they going to come up with next Volcano 2 The return of the lava. I mean come on this movie is so stupid the characters are so poorly developedand eve Robert Englund makes the movie worse I mean he might as well be transformed into Freddy Kruegur and Spook people. I was actually rooting for the bad guy to win thats how bad it was. I mean look the father is a cop he didnt seem to care real much about the fact that his daughter is going through one of the most moments in her life. I mean if my daughter was treated like that I would do everything in my power to keep the guy behind jail. Also it seems kind of obvious that Dee Snyders character would turn bad again.

'It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time. Its actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with its flaws captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if its made in the 90s it doesnt have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but Im afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand just has the real feeling. You just cant hate it. I think its an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn I want the theme song.',pos
'I caught this movie right in my eye when I was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema. The tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it I thought of the possibility of it being similar to National Lampoons Dorm Daze. I liked that movie aside from having a huge collection of such genres I decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser.<br /><br />Delightfully I came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie. Amanda Bynes definitely kicked it off better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. Being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to. This movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time. The only way of pulling it off is through this movie.<br /><br />The principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors. Id recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and dont worry you will get laughs throughout the movie. It is a definite guarantee.',pos
'Based on the actual event  this epic is set in the year 221 B.C and tells the true story of the unification of China. Action packed and filled with intrigue passion betrayals and unforgettable battle sequences it held my attention throughout in spite of its 160 minute length.<br /><br />The king Ying Zeng played by Li Xuejian is obsessed with unifying the seven kingdoms of China and becoming its first Emperor. His lover Lady Zhao played by the beautiful actress Gong Li devises a plot whereby she will travel to the neighboring kingdom of Yan to set a fake assassination plot in motion which will give the king an excuse to invade Yan. However she falls in love with the assassin as the king becomes more and more ruthless.<br /><br />There are subplots and tragedy and constant high drama. There are scenes of great beauty and of abject cruelty. There is great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space.<br /><br />The deep characterization made me think of Shakespeare. And tragic events that call to mind Greek drama. And yet it is totally Chinese as it deals with age-old questions of whether the ends justify the means. And raises the questions dealing with life and death and good and evil and all the blurred edges in between.<br /><br />It is the story of individuals against the backdrop of history a history that has shaped China for the past two thousand years. I was swept up in the story as well as the moral questions raised. There are no easy answers and this was one of the strengths of the movie.<br /><br />Recommended.

'Looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actors perform. However I was sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story. David Duchovny(Dr. Eugene Sands)Connie & Carla04 was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and losses his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by Angelina Jolie(Claire)Taking Lives04 who immediately becomes attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton(Raymond Blossom)Kinsey04 plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed. Gary Dourdan(Yates)CSI-Vegas TV Series plays a great supporting role and portrays a real COOL DUDE who is a so-called body guard for Raymond Blossom.

'I saw the 10p.m. showing and I must say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater wanting my time back (as I dont actually pay for movies anymore) I didnt really find any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />There were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger (in mind more than age as this film is rated R) male audience. The fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line but lets be honest its a whole lot of hype for very little pay off. The only truly horrible part of the film was the CG which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen.<br /><br />Now I am a reasonable man I knew going into the theater that I wasnt going to be seeing Casablanka and I am at least thankful that this film is an original (albiet inane) idea and not some re-make or franchise spin off. However to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months.',neg
'Rigoletto is Verdis masterpiece full of drama emotion and powerful memorable music. The maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but principalled Gilda as a horny ditz. Opera certainly can be adapted to cinema --- look at Zeferellis magnificent La Traviata --- but when a work is as superb as Rigoletto it doesnt need cheap gimmicks. It might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that.',neg
'The Book gets 10 out of 10 stars...<br /><br />PROBABLY CONTAINS SPOILERS OF BOTH THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE!!!<br /><br />If youve never read Geoffrey Households Rogue Male the source material for Man Hunt youll likely enjoy Fritz Langs treatment of the story. On the other hand if youre in my camp and have practically memorized the book the movie will be a crashing disappointment. Ill assume youve already read a synopsis of the story and proceed to my complaints. Households little novel is one of the all-time great suspense classics taut and spare with only a bare handful of characters to propel the action. Fritz Lang and his screen writer Dudley Nichols feel the need to throw in the protagonists brother and a sympathetic floozy the latter of which reduces the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the screenplay where the novel needed none. In fact the true climax of the book was not the nameless narrators escape from his underground lair but rather his self-acceptance of his true motive for going on his hunt in the first place. And thats another thing: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can get us all the way through Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists why cant Lang? Thorndyke? What hat did they pull that out of? Which brings me to my bitterest complaint: Households hunter is so quintessentially Britishhe would bleed a Union Jack if you cut him. But Walter Pigeon who plays him is Canadian! He can barely sustain the accent which is only slightly deeper and more convincing that Kevin Costners in Robin Hood. He looked about right in the role and was a fine actor for the 1940sbut as Rogue Males reluctant hero? Lets look to the Sceptered Isle itself for a more convincing version.

Filmed as an user aptly pointed out in a fake forestnear Paris the movie is fake horrorfake Celtic historyfake vestiges -you should see the professor (Wilms who was a wonderful M.Le Quesnoy in la vie est un long fleuve tranquille) scream for the invaluable scrap -which the production probably bought in a dime store-fake characters fake excavations...<br /><br />The boys disguised as druids are unintentionally very funny ;so are the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts.And what can we say of the professors? of the monster? A ten year old would write a better screenplay than this grotesque farce.To think that people can spend money for such drivel when artists are still waiting for a producer!<br /><br />Word to the wise:Maurice Leblanc wrote a marvelous story dealing with druids and old ceremonies in his Arsene Lupin saga called lîle aux trente cercueils .A miniseries was made 30 years ago.Avoid this Broceliande garbage and try to see it instead.',neg

'Thankfully I watched this film alone enabling me to fast-forward through the worst scenes (aka most of the film actually). OK some of it is not all bad with partially good photography (even some of the under water scenes) and at times not too bad directing. But it still doesnt save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting. Additionally when I dont find the movies hottie to be all that even the wannabe-sexy love making scenes get dull. Really dull! And for the drama: You know its always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really dont care who lives and who dies.<br /><br />If you still havent gotten tired of the reality series Survivor you may find something to your liking in this movie. If not stay well clear!',neg
'An American boy goes to Paris after his mother commits suicide becomes and artist and then discovers himself and returns to the States so he can make things right with his former friends.<br /><br />I have to think that the people who are rating this movie so highly are all X-Files fans even though there are no aliens or serial killers in it. Dont be fooled this movie blows chunks.<br /><br />The story is incoherent with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. When you do get an explanation it doesnt fit the story that went before it. What it does is bore you. For all the acting talent in the film it just isnt interesting. I spent the whole movie wondering when sex-addict Duchovny was going to bang someone. Maybe he was doing it behind the scenes; they should have filmed that instead.<br /><br />What comes across is a story of a self-obsessed artist worrying about minor incidents in his life and wanting to make them right somehow - even though they didnt seem that wrong to begin with. There arent any particularly interesting or shocking revelations despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minutes. Its just a guy thinking that his life is as interesting to you as it is to him. Its not.<br /><br />I saw in the trivia that Duchovny claims he wrote the script in a week thats entirely believable. The guy can act theres no doubt but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talents.<br /><br />Why Hollywood keeps greenlighting these self-discovery stories is beyond me. I discover myself in the shower every morning but I dont bother making a movie about it. Mine would probably be better than this one though; at least there would be some nudity.',neg
'I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape to leave everything behind and enjoy a story. I found this to be a good movie not great but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)<br /><br />Diane Lane was wonderful as always Richard Gere isnt an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.<br /><br />I think it was the kind of love story that doesnt always get told. It was messy and they had other priorities but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each other.<br /><br />Id definitely recommend it!',pos
'Christopher Guest need not worry his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at RPG-gamers.

'The Big Knife a movie about the dark side of the Hollywood motion picture industry is ironically far more like a filmed play than a film itself. Apart from a few very brief expository scenes all of the action takes place in the living room of the films hero played by Jack Palance. Hes a movie actor who wants out of his contract with his studio because of the lack of redeeming qualities in the films they put out. His on again off again wife (Ida Lupino) is also fed up with the studio not to mention her husbands philandering ways. Unfortunately for them both the head of the studio (Rod Steiger) is a real bastard. He has blackmail material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract. But its only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far.<br /><br />This film is not I repeat NOT a film noir. Rather its an exceptionally theatrical sitting-room melodrama. The plot proceeds at a snails pace and is so intricate and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with the static setting and carefully contrived blocking of the actual scenes. The acting is overwrought in the extreme and veers sharply between out and out histrionics and softer but no less unsubtle soliloquies that are obviously meant to be poignant but come across as pretentious twaddle especially in the hands of the woefully miscast Palance. Aldrich was obviously going all out for a stylized something here but I doubt even he knew what it was and certainly the audience never does.<br /><br />I think the main lesson here is that films and plays are very different mediums. What might have worked in a play did not come across as even remotely natural or plausible on film. The result? A big waste of time. Theres little to enjoy here.',neg
'Ive heard that this move was put together by a bunch of high-school students. As a high-school art or theatre project its not too bad. Unless you lived near milpitas in the seventies or knew someone involved in the making of the movie this is pretty awful. Most of the actors are clearly not actors but locals who volunteered. Bob Wilkins (the original host of Creature Features on KTVU in Oakland appears but only for about a minute). Some of the monster effects are done with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster suit and each works okay on its own but there is no continuity between the two. Watching without dialog youd assume that the movie had 2 monsters. I guess the most unsupportable aspect is that even the main characters who I assume are the kids behind the movie cannot even pretend to act. These kids must have been involved in theater in some way to want to do this project but they display zero believable emotion in front of the camera.',neg
'I completely disagree with the other comments! I too saw this film at an early screening and found it quite enjoyable. Robin Williams is in top form. True the tone is familiar but it is Williams of Good Morning Vietnam: smart funny on point. After too many dark turns Williams is finally back to what he does best. The supporting actors give great performances especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays himself as usual but as the agent to the next president he was a delight each time on screen. Lewis Black plays only himself basically but he is wonderfully well used here. There is also a fun turn by Jeff Goldblum. The movie is more than what the trailer suggests as well. The movie is funny but it is not a pure comedy as suggested. It has a bit of a thriller line which everyone should seriously consider especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.',pos
'I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash! There are films that are bad but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! The sex sequences so shocking in its day couldnt even arouse a rabbit. The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term. The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?<br /><br />',neg
'The monster will look very familiar to you. So will the rest of the film if youve seen a half-dozen of these teenagers-trapped-in-the-woods movies. Okay so theyre not teenagers this time but they may as well be. Three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. Youd think that with a title like Miners Massacre some interesting things might happen. They dont. In fact only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. I had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace praying that Black Lung Disease would get them before The Grim Reaper exacted his grisly revenge but instead I got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and in one case defecating--in the woods a gang of morons with a collective I.Q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of Cracker Jacks much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. No suspense no scares and plenty of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity.',neg
'My god whats going on? a Uwe Boll film and positive comments? Wow!<br /><br />Nice to note that most of the positive reviews are coming from newbies to Bolls work. I myself as I have stated in previous Uwe Boll reviews only watch his films in the hope that one day he will actually make something good. I mean..IT MUST HAPPEN ONE DAY!<br /><br />Alas Seed is not that day. I dont quite know where to start with the lame attempt at a horror film that Seed is. The thing to remember people is that all the sickos in the world are that way due to having watched various sick acts on video or the net.....or so Mr Boll believes. I still cant for the life of me figure out why footage of real animal abuse and killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of this film. I understand the concept that Seed (the killer) is a sicko and enjoys watching such stuff.....but cant understand why Mr Boll thought putting REAL footage in the film would work. Maybe to shock us? Hmmm.....well I for one am not squeamish and can handle seeing anything on film. I DONT though find the use of real animal cruelty footage entertaining in the slightest. If you were trying to shock me it didnt work. It just reminded me how messed up the world was because such things happen and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making films. This sort of context may have worked for films in the 70/80s (Cannibal Holocaust) but not todays market.<br /><br />With that out of the way we can move on to the fact that Uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feel all round like BloodRayne 2. You can just tell that there wasnt a huge amount of money floating around for production.<br /><br />As per usual Mr Boll does not really care for making a decent story as we are treated to boring shots of police officers watching various videos of Seeds victims in the first 25 mins. Each of these videos ends in a speeded up decomp of the victim. Its all very boring and tedious. I wont comment on the toddler scene as its laughable and just another cheap shock factor.<br /><br />If you manage to sit through the first 25 mins then you will be treated to the police officers walking through a very dark house in order to catch Seed. The lighting here is horrible and Uwe has the old Im not using a steady cam fiasco that he did with BloodRayne 2. Watch as the police officers die in ever stupidly increasing ways until such point as Seed is caught. This scene is soooo bloody stupid you have to see it to believe it. The cop actually tells Seed he could have shot him. For some un-be-known reason the cop doesnt shoot him. Given that Seed is a sicko that kills kids as well as adults youd have thought at this point in the script that sense would prevail.<br /><br />From here we are treated to a stupid execution scene followed by the cops burying Seed alive (and they know he is alive..why not shoot him in the head????) followed by Seed getting out of the ground and then killing some random woman with a hammer and then kidnapping the one of the cops family.<br /><br />What Im trying to get across to you all here is that its just plain STUPID! Its not even Hollywood horror stupid....just plain dumb. Uwe Boll can not direct ****. Anyone with any ounce of taste would agree with that statement. Anyone who watches this film and found it entertaining in any way shape or form needs to take a serious look at themselves as a person. <br /><br />Once again we are treated to a poorly acted directed lighted produced scripted piece of UB crap.',neg

'Tourist Trap is among my favorite late 70s/early 80s horror flicks. A group of young people are heading somewhere one pair in the car ahead & that car has a flat and our film opens with the young man Woody pushing the tire along looking for a service station. He finds a seemingly abandoned place and yet hears voices and investigates and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts. Along comes the rest of the young folks (in a VW Thing) and they pick up Woodys girlfriend and find this very same place Slausens Oasis or some such thing..and then Mr. Slausen happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream. Of course the VW Thing has mysteriously died at that point so odd Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum with lots of wax figures and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house where he says Davey lives. And who is Davey? Why Davey Crockett he says...but if it were Davey Crockett theyd all probably be safer. The girls are left alone while Slausen goes to help with fixing the car but of course curiosity gets the better of one & she goes to investigate and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one named...Davey. What follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one theyre taken prisoner by Davey who says hes Slausens brother. One girl (kidnapped earlier) is treated to a plaster facial which results in her death when it covers up her air supply. At any rate theres somewhat of a twist to this and kind (but weird) Mr. Slausen is not exactly what he appears to be. A good creepy late 70s horror flick and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere. 7 out of 10.',pos

'I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this #4. The 900+ theater was full and at the end it received a standing ovation. This was classic Peter Falk if you are a Falk fan and displayed a lot of chemistry between the Peter Falk and Paul Reiser characters. The films title seemed to long and too odd sounding to me. I am surprised this didnt make it into general release. This was far better than the majority of junk that the major studios throw at you. Maybe too adult in that it was geared to the baby boomer and senior audience. A lot of people could relate to situations in this movie. This will probably enjoy a revival of sorts years from now when people look back at this film and consider it a kind of a gem. I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it.',pos
'This film based on the book by Pascal Laime -La Dentelliere- is an acclaimed film of excellent cinematography and costly Italian language. Set in a scholastic 19th Century Balzac-style set it portraits the story of a mad love story: a man and a woman. There is an infamous line at this shadowy-Mussolinni strike which reads: She does not smell like tomatoes. Sage perfumery of this Italian masterpiece Scola is a director of the stature of Mussolinni: his cake will jump in your strawberries and if you let this director he will cream your olives as a Superman. Remember Nietzsche? This one will scare the HELL out of YOU: dont forget to visit Mussolinnis cake next to the Colisseum in Rome across the Via Appia. This movie will wipe your Pampers inside-out and outside-in it will make you cry out of Romantic joy! If you liked Ulysses you will wipe it good with these strawberries until the end of the roll. Enjoy!',pos
'So many great talents were utilized in The Best Years of Out Lives the result has to be somewhat miraculous. Think of what its director William Wyler faced; in the aftermath of a military victory over statist powers who had committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world if battles he was making a film that argued that the USs leaders were themselves profoundly anti-individual--that they had wasted the best years of the lives of those drafted or misled into fighting the war--which since it ignored the rights of individuals had been for nothing except argument over the degree of slavery men were to exist under. There are beautiful sets by Julia Heron Gregg Tolands cinematography and a script by Robert E. Sherwood author of The Road to Rome and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas. The ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as Frederic March Myrna Loy Teresa Wright Dana Andrews Virginia Mayo Cathy ODonnell and Hoagy Carmichael into a large-scale but thematic drama. The clever plot line was the experiences of thee couples after the soldiers (three being spotlighted) tried to return home to a victory culture. Their bitter experiences and their realization of their own need to fight again against what was happening on the homefront poses a strong and sobering counterpoint to the conventional notion being sold that all was well with America. March and his wife have a terrible time adjusting and he is drinking; ODonnells young man Harold Russell has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can even be worth living; and worst of all Andrews wife throws him over for a guy with dough and he has lost years causing employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job to consideration on his individual merits to have even what he had before he had been ripped from his life and thrust into the arena of risk--for nothing and loss of everything he had ever had. The shattering climax of the film comes when each of the three has to confront the need to do battle againeach for his own happiness; and all three succeed in finding the courage to go on fighting--each for his own happiness which is now being threatened by a curiously anti-self anti-reality indifferent an un-American United States. Wylers direction especially of the scene where Andrews sits in the cockpit of a mothballed B-17 alone and the scene of Russells wedding is wonderful indeed. This is a most powerful film and a great one on its own terms one women and men can agree on for once. Music by Hugo Friedhofer and costumes by Irene Sharaff add to its luster. One of the best and most unexpected films of all time in stunning B/W.',pos

It was such a parody on the mind-numbing tripe that we watch on a daily basis. It isnt one of Schwarzeneggers best performances but on the whole it is a very good film. The underlying idea that Television Corporations will one day be the real rulers of the planet is very believable and is very well portrayed in this film. Of course there are the usual Arnie one-liners my favourite is when he is about to be catapulted into the gamezone the gameshow host asks Any last words? Arnie says: Yeah Ill be back but the host quips Only in a re-run and presses the eject button. I give this film a 10 for sheer originality. I must have watched it 30 or more times.

'This is possibly the worst film I have ever seen. What a weak waste of Michael Imperiolis obvious talent. Disgusting film from start to finish. All I can say is this director is no auteur. You never once get inside the game the characters head the amazing talent with numbers the real Stuey had. The coke scene is bad enough to throw your shoe at the set it might have been a great scene had it been shot for movies and not the stage with the camera half way across the house hovering over a mirror with drugs on it while the drama is going on far in the background. The scene where he wins the big championship is just laugh out loud ridiculous. This should be screened in Film-making 101 - What Not To Do In Making Pictures.',neg
'Gritty dusty western from director Richard Brooks who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact. Early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman) a suave gambler (James Coburn) a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent) and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part) this becomes a fairly engrossing entry though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from Gary Coopers era). Good-looking if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly. ** from ****',neg
'This movie was thoroughly unwholesome unsettling and unsatisfying. Apart from a few nice shots of Italy theres nothing to recommend this movie. As usual Hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a fractured existence--the _next_ guy you meet whom you sleep with after knowing for a few hours _he_ must be Mr. Right. As for humor there is some in the movie but I cant see how anyone could possibly label this a romantic _comedy_ since about three-quarters of the movie is totally depressing! My recommendation? Skip it in the theaters wait till it comes out on DVD then skip it there also. I want someone to give me back the two hours I wasted watching this dreck drivel dross.',neg
'With Knightly and OTool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly maybe some tension. But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants. It was of course totally superficial beautiful English country and seaside or not.The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part. They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements.',neg
'Man oh man! What a piece of crummy film-making! But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose California (right on the border of Cupertino) we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system. And they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her dopey adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script makes almost no sense the direction is poor the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance a lot of dialog thats so bad its good and a nice Carole King song played over the end credits. Maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick. And hey everybody knows there aint no gold in the Grand Canyon!',neg
'They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly but there are also a lot of well documented facts still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean this is not the Robin Hood story not the Arthurian legends not Beowulf not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99\% guesswork. Its only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. <br /><br />So its silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Careys excellent novel The True History of the Kelly Gang I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no the fact is that Mick Jaggers much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality and a better movie overall which isnt saying a whole lot for it.<br /><br />Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! Ill give it 3/10 and thats only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.',neg
'Parsifal (1982) Starring Michael Kutter Armin Jordan Robert Lloyd Martin Sperr Edith Clever Aage Haugland and the voices of Reiner Goldberg Yvonne Minton Wolfgang Schone Director Hans-Jurgen Syberberg.<br /><br />Straight out of the German school of film the kind that favored tons of symbolism and Ingmar Bergmanesque surrealism came this 1982 film of Wagners final masterpiece- Parsifal written to correspond with Good Friday/Easter and the consecration of the Bayreuth Opera House. This film follows the musical score and plot accurately but the manner in which it was filmed and performed is bold and avant-garde and no other Parsifal takes the crown in its bizarre cinematography. Syberberg is known for controversial films. Prior to this film he had released films about Hitler and Nazism Richard Wagner and his personal Anti-Semitism and a documentary about Winifred Wagner one of his grand-daughters. This film is possibly disturbing in many aspects. Parsifal (sung by Reiner Goldberg but acted by Michael Kutter) is a male throughout the first part of the film and then after the enchantment of Kundrys kiss is transformed into a female. This gender-bending element displays the feminine/masculine/ying-yang nature of the quest for the Holy Grail which serves all mankind and redeems it through Christs blood. In the pagan sorcerer Klingsors fortress there are photographs of such notoriously sinister figures as Hitler Nietzche Cosima Wagner and Wagners mistress Matilde Wesendock. The Swaztika flag hangs outside the fortress. Parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film. The tempting Flower Maidens are in the nude. Kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt Mary Magdalene or Eve from Genesis (played by Edith Clever but beautifully sung by mezzo-soprano Yvonne Minton). Ultimately this film is for fans of this type of bizarre Germanic/European symbolic metafiction and for intellectuals who appreciate the symbolism the history and lovers of Wagner opera. Indeed the singing is grand and compelling. Reiner Goldbergs Parsifal is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater Parsifals of the stage - James King Wolfgang Windgassen Rene Kollo and todays own Placido Domingo. Yvone Minton is a sensual-voiced dramatic and exciting Kundry delving into her tormented state perfectly. While the production is certainly unorthodox and as un-Wagnerian as it can possibly get (Wagners concept was Christian ceremonial pomp with Grails spears castles Knights and wounded kings a dark sorcerer darkness turning into light etc typical Wagnerian themes)..it is still an enjoyable art-house film.',pos
'Actually this movie has silly moments both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part and its much worse than other MJ movies like The Wiz Captain Eo and Ghosts. But as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years (Yeah thats half my life you guys!) I cant complain too much about it. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to Heaven for me. But as a movie its not good at all and Im afraid that it would get a much lower grade for me if my darling Mike hadnt been the one starring in it.

'This movie is not that good at all.Its pretty stupid pretty annoying and very poorly done.I really only saw this film was because one of my friends said they hated this film.Although I didnt hate it as much as them I still found it to be a pretty bad film.The only thing that is remotely good about this was that it was a little entertaining at times and also I feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been equally okay.What I mean by a little better is that if it had been totally recast not have had it looked like it had been shot for a film festival and if the script had been improved it would have been a okay slasher film.Instead it isnt but instead what it is now a crappy film.The acting is atrocious I felt as if I was watching a couple of teens act for like a Halloween show or Thrill ride or something.The kills are pretty cheap(as is the film itself) and basically everything else is low-class.Overall this film really is bad and you wouldnt be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this film.<br /><br />3.8 out of 10 stars',neg
'The actors are so bland that its almost impossible to tell them apart (Pauline Kael said of this movie: The actors have names but theyre truly anonymous) and the special effects are really bad. They simulate weightlessness with people hanging on cables and by recycling the trick that let Fred Astaire dance on the ceiling in Royal Wedding (but none of these guys move well enough to make it look convincing). <br /><br />The low point of the movie is when one of the characters an airplane tycoon is trying to convince some other giants of industry to come in with him in a moon-rocket consortium and he shows them a Woody Woodpecker cartoon that explains how a rocket works at a 2nd grade level! (And to think that Robert Heinlein worked on the screenplay...)<br /><br />The only plus is that the production design manages to communicate a sort of Amazing Stories sensibility and even that is done much better in the producers (George Pal) subsequent movie When Worlds Collide which has similar bad acting but is much more entertaining. However Pals best sci-fi movie has to be The Time Machine.',neg

If so this film crashed entirely.<br /><br />There is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem.<br /><br />The film is just too choppy to work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor. This causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing. The older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance.<br /><br />Then we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank. Obviously the robbery goes awry but there doesnt seem to be any punishment for the crooks. Perhaps the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film.',neg
'I have bought the complete season of Surface. watched it in 3 days! I was so captured by the the plot theories and basically everything about this show. The actor who plays Miles is great. Miles sister mother and father acted like real life family would. You could connect on so many levels its fascinating.<br /><br />I find animals are so wonderful you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child. It would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists.<br /><br />Am sadden that Surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows. I have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book.<br /><br />Love the show very much. For those who havent watched Surface if you like sci-fi you need to watch this!!!!!!!!!!!!!',pos
'Comedy Central has a habit of putting on great programs at times-Chappelles Show The Daily Show Colbert Report and then there are those that some people love or hate-Stella Dr. Katz. Then there are some shows that have their defenders but are just plain awful- Mencia and now Sarah Silverman.<br /><br />This show is based on the fact Silverman is self-Centered which can be funny (Colbert Report) but can be horrible (Mind of Mencia). It should shock no one that I believe the latter is the case. This show is a parody of a sitcom and society a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply isnt funny. A woman farting has been done in comedy many many times because its not something thats common. We dont need 25 minutes of it. When a criminal is disarmed by a queef it simply loses its appeal-we saw it in Jay and Silent Bob Strike back except the women were hotter and the whole scene was more absurd making it better. But the best comparison of this show is to Stella except Stella was more subtle which is what made the absurdist comedy funny. It had better acting and I suppose a bit more of a fantastical realist view.<br /><br />Perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative (Im very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute fan reaction) to this show is the amount of advertising on it very obnoxious ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs. Many people are wondering why Sarah Silverman has a career and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled. This show shouldve never made it past the unaired pilot stage. Back to Norm showed far more promise yet this show makes it further. And as far as critics being correct many things have been universally panned have seen their status rise immensely. Last I checked Britney Spears gets good reviews too also. Take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic on IMDb for not liking this show.',neg

'Im very disappointed. First of all the German synchronization is bad. Maybe in the original version (with subtitles) it would have been better but the whole movie looks like if the director saw Luna Papa and Black Cat White Cat and tried to produce something in this style too. But failed in every aspect. Its an incongruent mixture of a weird unbelievable story and very childish gags. No atmosphere no life. Extremely primitive sex-humor.

'Tipping The Velvet is one of the modern day television productions that prove that some television can be just as good or even better(as this is) than what you see at your local theater. <br /><br />If you want to read the plot read this and if you want other details skip down to the next paragraph. This is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional young girl named Nan who works as a naive oyster girluntil she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty who dresses as a male for her stage profession. The young girl soon joins the act as another male impersonator and they are a major hit. Soon the both of them embark on a tender affair. Kitty eventually becomes enveloped in a marriage of convenience and ravages young Nans heart. From then on Nan works as male impersonated prostitute to men looking to have sex with boys then she becomes the private sex slave to the evil and sadomasochistic Diana where Nan experiences severe emotional abuse. When that ends badly Nan is on the streets again where she recalls a young woman named Florence; a good-hearted socialist who had the true potential of being a wonderful partner. Thats where Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to get back to fame. <br /><br />The region 1 transfer is of exceptional picture quality there is a very good scene selection an eloquent photo gallery and a fun interview between novelist Sara Waters and the films writer Andrew Davies. <br /><br />The sets costumes cinematography and music are gorgeous. The acting writing and directing are extremely strong and filled with realism class and originality. I loved the film and the novel. Section III in the film is much different in the film than in the novel because section III in the novel is great written down but isnt screen material. I will be brave and say that I love the films interpretation of it much more. <br /><br />This breathtaking historical ingeniously combines Drama Comedy Erotica and Romance to vibrant perfection in a way that is both deeply moving and spiritually uplifting. For every mature and open-minded adult who has ever felt the pleasures pains and power of falling in love and living life to its fullest. A revolutionary production; an absolute must-see!',pos
'This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible  Sarah`s law  following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne . In fact it`s scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-sense<br /><br />If truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud . The edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims . Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile . Cue the child`s frightened screams . Like I said very poor taste <br /><br />Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs (  No one knows this but it`s a scientific fact  ) Labour MP Barbara Follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim  Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old Colonel  . Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they`re classed as obscene . The photos included Barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head  a dog`s body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to John Holmes . Hey I never said this show was tasteful did I ? <br /><br />It`s impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians  childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject . The show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but it`s a biting satire . Perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of Britain before they criticise a mere TV show for exacerbating tensions .',pos
'Uh oh! I just said the this classic film has a plot that STINKS! Well its true...so get over it! This film was a vanity project for Joseph P. Kennedy in which his mistress starred and money flowed to make her an even bigger star. Today only a fragmentary copy exists--one that was retored a few years back. However even if the film had been in perfect shape it STILL would have stunk for many reasons. And without further ado here are some of my reasons: <br /><br />First Gloria Swanson aged 31 plays a girl in a convent school--perhaps aged 16 or 18! Come on--she looks old enough to be the mother of many of the kids.<br /><br />Second the movie all hinges on the stupid concept of love at first sight. While some people believe it this it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw away EVERYTHING on a woman he didnt even know! What a lot of hooey! <br /><br />Third the movie is histrionic and the plot is nuts! After leaving the school Kelly goes off to East Africa and then becomes Queen of the Whores--and later after the evil queen back in Europe dies (thats convenient) the prince is able to get out of prison actually finds Kelly and marries her and she then becomes queen of a real honest-to-goodness country! Gimme a break--this is RIDICULOUS even in the days of silent film this plot was a groaner!<br /><br />So in summary this is a poor film with great production values (mistresses need to LOOK good) that is parading around as a classic! There are so many BETTER silent films out there--see them first and avoid this tripe.',neg
'This isnt the worst movie Ive ever seen but I really cant recall when Ive seen a worse one. I thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation.

The first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown in.<br /><br />*Possible spoiler*<br /><br />The 40-or-so minute memorial scene (with requisite black umbrellas and rain) to fictitious crash victims was lame and I thought it would never end. <br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs unless you revel in conflict.<br /><br />',neg
'Rozemas 1999 adaptation of Mansfield Park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film. The 1999 film is reviled by many Austen purists but I admire the job Rozema did in making Mansfield Park her own. It may not be strictly Jane Austens Mansfield Park but at least it was well-written beautifully shot and well-acted by a superior cast. I dont see how Austen purists can be any happier with this 2007 version from ITV (and rebroadcast on Masterpiece Theatre/PBS). The screenplay is shoddily pasted together and dumbed down to boot the production values are lackluster and the cast (apart from Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson) are largely guilty of bad acting. I cant think of a worst miscast than Billie Piper as Fanny Price. Her look was all wrong (bleached hair and dark brows??) and her talent simply wasnt suited to the material. Sir Thomas looked constipated the whole time. Michelle Ryan as Mariah was on autopilot as were the actors who portrayed the Crawfords (when I think how superior Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the 99 version I just kinda shake my head).<br /><br />I havent seen the 1983 version so I cant comment on it but Id advise anyone whos curious to give the 99 version a chance. Read the novel before or after and make up your own mind.',neg
'This is the best and most original show seen in years. The more I watch it the more I fall in love with it. The cast is excellent the writing is great. I personally like every character. However there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life. I believe ABC has done a disservice to the writers actors and to the potential audience of this show to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following. There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful . This show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would love this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away. I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors this show had so much promise. The recent episode was the best one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so real. Please watch this show on ABCs video and let ABC know you wish to have this show back. PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html',pos

'This is high-gloss soft-porn; a boring soap opera concentrating on one thing: sex. They actually made sex boring sad to say because I defy you to watch this casually and tell me what the storyline was. What this is is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show off her great body and for Mickey Rourke to smirk a lot. Thats it. Rourkes smugness is so bad its sickening and Bassinger despite the great figure looks cheap more than beautiful.<br /><br />Kudos to the photographer for some nice closeup shots and some wonderful color but the story is so weak - no character development and no plot - its unable to compensate. Lets face it: this movie was made for only reason - to titillate male viewers. On that level it probably succeeded. If I recall its why I gave it a look being a fan of Bassingers looks but I actually expected a story too.<br /><br />Those trying to pass this off as arty and something deeper than soft porn are only fooling themselves.',neg
'Though not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word this more rewarding than any movie full of laughs but devoid of substance. I dont think Bergmans movies can be easily classed under narrow genres even the lightest are quite complex. This movie in spite of its light touch poses a series of problems related to marriage and its shortcomings and what happens when the flames start to die etc. I dont really communicate personally with all these issues as I am sure others do. But the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary you almost wish it not to end. I have to admit that I was swept away by the Bergman of the fifties having come to know most of his later groundbreaking efforts. Before Nykvist von Sydow Ulman etc. the master produced some of the richest warm and touching movies I have ever seen. Though its a long shot I have seen this kind of love for human kind in its complexity only in Fellinis movies of the same period. A Lesson in Love alongside Smiles of a Summer Night are worth seeing for Bergman fans to have the full image of the mans capabilities and for those who love cinema with a heart. May he rest in peace!',pos

Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a construction worker trying to find himself in his native heritage. They show each other different ways of looking at things.

This is a twisted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in the simple everyday things. The style is artsy and chock full of symbolism.

It is a movie that explores the underworld of the weird wretched and devastated individuals. This one strays from the path but certainly worth watching!',pos
'This is a racist movie but worthy of study and enjoyment. First time through it the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a relaxed peaceful thing going what with her still at home about to graduate from high school and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something. Second time through you realize how horribly the sisters husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar. He takes it its the thing to do these days and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather. In that same scene the sisters blues song is a real tear-jerker if youre the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music. Her performance feels like the climax of the story; a blues story with the good guys being people of color in their element in backwoods SC. Meanwhile all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies. Thats cool long as you recognize it as fiction.',pos
'The storyline of The Stranger mirrors somewhat the 1969 film Journey to the Far Side of the Sun (made by Gerry & Sylvia Anderson of Thunderbirds and Space: 1999 fame). A parallel-universe Earth is the premise of both films. But there is a difference. Where the world in The Stranger features a totalitarian regime out to squash the freedom of the citizenry Journey to the Far Side of the Sun merely showed a true mirror world where handwriting roads houses machinery of every kind and of course internal organs were all in reverse (or mirrored) order. So the similarity of parallel Earths is the only connection of both films.<br /><br />Similarly the TV series Land of the Giants came before both of those films having run from 1968 to 1970. It featured a world that was nearly parallel to the Earth with the exception that the planet was populated by giants 12 times the size of the humans who crash-landed there. The idea of a totalitarian government out to capture and contain the little people was similar to the premise of The Stranger more-so than the premise of JTTFSOTS. Perhaps because of the similarly to LOTG a series to The Stranger was shelved. Had it turned into a TV series it would have been a sci-fi version of The Fugitive with star Glenn Corbett being chased by the baddies from week to week hiding out in different locations etc. BTW a stronger script could have helped this film along.',neg
'Hollywoods misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits. For every Godfather II there are dozens of More American Graffitis Stayin Alives and Grease 2s. While the original Grease is not a great film the 1977 adaptation of the long-running Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960s energetic choreography and an appealing cast. When Paramount began work on a follow-up the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster.<br /><br />Fortunately for moviegoers Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts. Her talent and beauty were already evident herein and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform. Maxwell Caulfield however lacks even the skill to express embarrassment and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic. What romantic interest beyond hormones could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield? That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory. Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden Connie Stevens and Sid Caesar have any wit although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material.<br /><br />Reviewers have complained that because Grease 2 is always compared to the original the movie comes up lacking. However even taken on its own terms the film is a clunker. After a frenetic opening number which evidently exhausted the entire cast the energy dissipates. With few exceptions the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960s and the only nostalgia evoked is for Our Miss Brooks and Sid Caesars Comedy Hour. The jokes fall flat and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite. However worse films have been inflicted on audiences and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters. Unfortunately Grease 2 is not even unintentionally funny. Instead the film holds the viewers attention like a bad train wreck. Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered the next scene plunges into even worse carnage.',neg

The story of Biko an influential leader and his main influencee Donald Woods is a heartbreaking one. But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. Cry Freedom manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot.

'Anyone new to the incredibly prolific Takashi Miikes work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director. In keeping with Miikes working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with. What takes the movie out of the realms of the same-old same-old however is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in todays cinema. And this isnt that nice cool clean violence so beloved of US cinema - this stuff is nasty painful and HURTS! That said the pace is breakneck the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities Miikes sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be making it hard to look away from the screen whatever he might be showing you! It doesnt have the Ohmigod ending of Dead Or Alive but if youre not squeamish nows the time to get on board the Miike bandwagon before he ends up on some Hollywood studios new John Woo shopping list...',pos

'This an free adaptation of the novels of Clarence Mulford; fans of the Willaim Boyd films will probably feel a little at sea here (and the reviews here so far reflect that). But I knew of Hopalong from the novels first and never cared much for the Boyd films once I got around to them.<br /><br />Christopher Coppola has made a wise choice - he has not made a nostalgic Western; instead he has approached the Cassidy story as a slice of what we used to call Americana; or what older critics once called homespun. As the film unraveled I found myself more and more reminded of the great Hallmark Theater version of Mark Twains Roughing It with James Garner narrating.<br /><br />Both these films remind us that although films about the old west are probably always to be mythic for Americans they need not be westerns; they can very well be just films about what it meant to be American in that time in that place.<br /><br />I never feel pandered to watching this film; theres no effort to shove the Boyd-Cassidy legacy down our throats no irony no camp. Consequently I get a sense of these characters as having walked - or ridden horseback - across some real western America I too could have walked a hundred years ago.<br /><br />Given that the plainness of the film - it positively avoids anything we have come to call style - is all to its favor; and the plain acting of the performers fits neatly in with this; gosh it really does feel like some story told around a campfire on a cattle drive - no visual dressing just the quirks and good humor - and sudden violence - that we expect from the good narration of an adventure yarn. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film and if the viewer sets aside encultured expectations he or she will find considerable pleasure in it.<br /><br />I would have given this film 9-stars but Ill give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point completely; and I urge them to set their memories of Boyd aside and give this film another chance.<br /><br />Note 1: A reviewer complained that Hopalong shoots people dead in this film rather than shooting the guns out of their hands (ala Boyds Cassidy); first Cassidy DOES shoot people dead in the novels; second if Cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot people dead - the problem with shooting guns out of peoples hands is that they can always get another gun - which happens to be part of the subtext of this very film.<br /><br />Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family that they have the Director of The Godfather among them who can get them all opportunities to make movies that I cant; but a good movie is a good movie; and this is a good movie. If its by somebody by the name Coppola well thats just is as it is. America is the land of opportunity (or was until Bush got into office) - thats what the great American novels are all about.',pos
'The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb. The soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy. One by one the blood is drained from those involved in the dig.<br /><br />To be as brief as possible Pharaohs Curse is quite the lackluster affair. While the movie does present a few good original ideas (blood sucking mummys soul transference interesting make-up effects the arm ripping scene etc.) and a few atmospheric moments the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding. To make matters even worse the first 15 of the films relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding. I usually go for these slow moving mummy movies but Pharaohs Curse tests even my patients. The cast helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character) the cast is as dull as the screenplay. Finally I dont know whose idea it was to put the mummy-looking servant in what appears to be pajamas but its a laughable ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience.<br /><br />Despite my mostly negative comments on the Pharaohs Curse Im going to rate it a 4/10. Not a good rating to be sure but generous given all the problems I have with the movie.',neg

'This is a modest unassuming traditional Western with a formulaic plot about opposition between ranchers and crop farmers around the town of Liberal Kansas .The story is essentially routine and features a number of the classic Western conflicts .There is the farmer versus the cattleman;there is the clash between cultivated land and civilizing tendencies on the one hand and the wilderness/frontier ethos on the other and what this represents ultimately is the opposition of two value systems -democratic and community values as set against rugged individualism .<br /><br />Randolph Scott plays legendary lawman Bat Masterton who rides into Liberal at behest of a land agent (Robert Ryan ) to help him sort out the bad guys who are the hard drinking brawling cattlemen .The two men quarrel but reunite to tackle the troublesome elements in the town .<br /><br />The script is clichéd but the action is propelled along with vigour by director Ray Enright and there are solid performances all round .In addition to rugged performances by the male leads there is comic relief supplied by George Gabby Hayes an oily villain nicely played by Steve Brodie and attractive contributions from Maggie Meredith as a prim and proper Easterner wooed by Ryan and Anne Jeffreys as a saloon singer As long as you do not place a premium on originality this is good sturdy entertainment for Western lovers',pos
'Years ago I read the book A Máquina (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.<br /><br />When I knew about the movie I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well happily my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.<br /><br />I cant recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text. Also I cant recall such a powerful performance like Gustavo Falcãos.<br /><br />You can see and feel how colossal his love for Karina is. You can realize that hell move mountains and do anything for this love.<br /><br />Do see this movie watch it thru the eyes of the kid that lives inside you enchant yourself!',pos
'One Star. Thats all this documentary deserves. I havent felt this disappointed in watching a movie let alone a documentary in quite some time.<br /><br />Im a BIG fan of the Walking With... series including its Nigel Marvin spin-offs for all their gleeful fun yet informative information. And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. Having seen all the other docs from the series I figured I need to see this one as well especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places.<br /><br />Well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc... what were you thinking?! lol.<br /><br />Though the information that they were able to get through was interesting the presentation failed in every other way possible. It had a terrible flow was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say (with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place) horrible effects (that includes the few moments of CGI and especially the makeup effects) and overused MTV-style camera effects.<br /><br />Speaking of the makeup effects one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man-in-suit horror movie. Well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous. None of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions.<br /><br />The worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way or looks remotely real. It doesnt even look like it was taken seriously. It also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode in Walking With Dinosaurs of the fate of the Ornithochirus (sp?)? That episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time I watch it. Its this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all. When you are more engaged in the subject and its own personal story even one that is just speculation you care more about the facts surrounding it.<br /><br />The only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration (at least in the BBC version I saw) and the music. Otherwise DO NOT bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh (which I did frequently but usually followed by rolling eyes). This does not belong on the shelf with the other Walking With... docs.<br /><br />And does it make sense to learn that this doc was NOT produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series? Hmmm...',neg
'Im somewhat of a fan of Lynches work so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately I was very let down. Its a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor. The animation is very crude no doubt done using Macromedia. Each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows. <br /><br />For people who are not familiar with this vein of animation they will probably be somewhat impressed by it. However if youve spent much time on Newgrounds.com like me then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff youve seen before. Many of the popular amateur artists on Newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this DVD. If Lynch submitted this work to the website then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of Newgrounds artists. But since I saw this on DVD instead of on Newgrounds I give it a 4/10 instead of a 7/10 as I would have otherwise. These cartoons are fit for the internet but with a name like David Lynch on it I expected better quality both in story and in animation.',neg
'Stripes an army training camp comedy starring Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman is a favourite of mine. Meatballs a summer camp romp starring Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman is a complete waste of time. It takes a considerable effort for four screenwriters to produce a movie (the word comedy infers a work with mirth aforethought) as witless anaemic and boring as this.<br /><br />Murray evidently reached the same conclusion during filming but his usually reliable powers of improvisation escape him and his flailing attempts to inject life into proceedings just add to the embarrassment - the It really doesnt matter chanting scene is excruciating. It doesnt help that the supporting cast is bereft of talent - the funniest thing about them is their hair but then Meatballs was made in 1979. (And introducing Chris Makepeace as Rudy announce the opening credits. No not THE Chris Makepeace?!).<br /><br />Mercifully Reitman rectified his mistake two years later for Stripes. Murrays shtick is so much funnier when hes larking around with the likes of John Candy Warren Oates and John Larroquette. Ditch this and watch that.',neg
'The movie is absolutely silly.<br /><br />But were you expecting a high-brow intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chous acting isnt exactly the most moving thing Ive ever seen but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No not really. Was it thoroughly entertaining if youre just taking it at surface value? Absolutely. Its a movie about some Chinese eye-candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. Theres an evil Triad-style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of this. A love interest. Its formulaic but really suspend disbelief for a while. Come on. Its called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you signed on for? Do yourself a favor if you watch it - I found myself a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise but we got a great laugh out of it. They would appear to be extremely fixated on Jerusalem and the numbers 1 10.<br /><br />I laughed I cried I hurled. Id watch it again.<br /><br />Especially for that fight scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table - Id LOVE to play on one of those.<br /><br />Slick enough for me but I dig on trash cinema.',pos
'In the midst of a documentary about his parents the filmmakers mother dies but he continues making the documentary discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.<br /><br />Our admiration is with the filmmaker not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents relationship but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama. Although the stuff of Hollywood lurks in the details Doug Block treats the story as he would everyday life. For those of us who have always speculated about our parents life before we came on the scene (or after we arrived but while we were too self- absorbed to notice they had a life independent of ourselves) 51 Birch Street gives fair warning: There are wondrous things back there in fatherland but beware if you choose to enter there.<br /><br />But that caution is for the audience to go slow wandering about in the details of their parents past. It is not a warning for those offered a glimpse into the life of Blocks parents. The film is a marvel at making the mother come alive as a vibrant and passionate yet introspective person who makes her own conscious decisions during the 50s. The filmmakers particular success is to make the viewers actually see the young woman behind the elderly parent and grandparent. We all know our parents were once young and vigorous but in 51 Birch Street the mother is. The father who has been distant while the filmmaker and his sister were growing up ultimately remains distant in the film but that is due more to his own elusive nature than to his portrayal. This biography turned autobiography is dramatic intense and unforgettable sure to send viewers scurrying for a closer look at their own family albums but more hesitant about looking at the backs of those photographs.',pos
'THE STAR PACKER is one of about 152000000 westerns that John Wayne acted in during the 1930s. Well the number is a bit exaggerated but it seemed almost like this many. This is because these B-movies were quickly made with very low budgets in order to be the second or lesser feature in a theater. Most Bs were pretty cheap and tended to cut corners to keep down costs and THE STAR PACKER is no exception. To save on costs incidental music is not used running times were kept to under an hour the writing was often rather derivative and the actors are mostly lesser talents--and Wayne himself was definitely far from being a household name at this time. Some of these Wayne features are pretty good while others like this one are watchable but also rather silly and inconsequential. I enjoyed this film and most of the others but its probably because I cut Bs a lot of slack.<br /><br />Wayne stars as John Travers--a US Marshall investigating the actions of a local gang out to chase locals out and steal from the stage. This is odd as the film was apparently set in the modern time or close to it as they used telephones and modern machine guns--things you just wouldnt expect to find in the Old West. Such anachronisms are actually pretty common in B Westerns--as Gene Autry films (for example) abound with them. Waynes sidekick is Yak--played by stuntman and real life friend of Wayne Yakima Canutt.<br /><br />The bad guy is an unknown figure referred to as The Shadow and he dispenses his instructions through a black screen that hides his face! This sounds exactly like a character from a movie serial--the sort of baddie that kids loved but grownups groaned at because they were so silly and at bit like Blofeld or Dr. Evil! The problem is if you listen to his voice AND pay any attention at all it becomes obvious early in the film that this Shadow is George Hayes. Now speaking of Hayes this is the same guy who later in films was known as Gabby Hayes but here and in several other of Waynes early films he looks and acts NOTHING like Gabby. In THE STAR PACKER he was well dressed articulate and clean-shaven--imagine that! In real life apparently this was more the real George Hayes--though I doubt that he was evil! Now as you can tell from the last paragraph that there really is no mystery in this film. You are left with acting (passable and nothing more) and stunts--which were actually pretty amazing. Again and again one amazing stunt after another occurred--such as men jumping from horse to horse and some great fight scenes--all done by the way by Canutt and his friends. Canutt was often John Waynes double in films--and this went on for decades. The problem with some of the stunts however is that it appears that the film makers actually killed a few horses to get those great stumbling horses bits seen later in the film. Up until about 1940 film makers often strung thin metal wire and ran horses across it at full gallop! In the process the horses legs were usually broken and the horses were subsequently euthanized! One of the worst examples of this was the film JESSE JAMES--where several horses were brutally killed--leading to the American Humane Association insisting that a representative of the organization be on film shoots to certify that animals are NOT hurt in the production. So since about 1940 films bear this little disclaimer. THE STAR PACKER was made well before the disclaimer and I cant see how the horses did these tricks without being killed.<br /><br />Overall this is at best a time-passer due to a poor plot occasionally poor acting and an unbelievable cruel attitude towards the horses. I am no bleeding heart but just cant understand this disregard for a poor old animal.',neg
'It resembles so much to movies like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS that is impossible to think that Tarantinos films werent a source of inspiration to this THURSDAY. However for a low cost B-Series movie its not bad. The plot about gangsters is captivating and funny and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm we can find in PULP FICTION. The resources werent many fore sure but the film is well produced. The acting also is good. I enjoyed the scene when the girl was sat on the sofa teasing the doctor... It was hot and funny at the same time! The soundtrack is nice too. I didnt hear too many songs but the ones I heard I liked. I score it 7/10.',pos
'Co-directed by and starring Rutger Hauer this film short was based on a short story by Dutch writer Harry Murlisch.<br /><br />In the 10 minutes of the films length you will get to see a life-time as Harry unravels his long-time fascination with a room he passes constantly in his youth. Returning to the city many years later he finds he has rented the same room.<br /><br />Using black and white film the textures are accentuated in this delicate telling of a tale. The voice of Harry drawing you into his world.<br /><br />A subtle tight performance from Rutger Hauer and 2 non-speaking characters. Wonderful soundtrack by Dutch musician Dyzack.<br /><br />At the moment difficult to see this movie as it is only available on DVD region 2 Linfidele (Liv Ullman) as a bonus track.

'The first mistake you make in titling a film is to use of the living dead without really having a budget for real zombie FX. Sure this was a low budget zombie flick - really low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects.<br /><br />It was really not too bad considering the above and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you are going to get an R for violence you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked.

'I watched SHORE LEAVE the other day. Ive seen it so many times and I never get tired of it. Strangely enough every time I watch it lately it takes me right back to the very first time I saw it. Including this time. Must be that sense of mystery and What IS going on here? about it.<br /><br />Oddly enough the one part of the story that ALWAYS felt awkward and uncomfortable for me this time actually had a HUGE effect on me-- Ruth. I think a lot of it was Gerald Frieds score. A real masterpiece that! The romantic section was reused-- much more extensively-- in THIS SIDE OF PARADISE. But of course it debuted here. I get the impression that out of all the girls Kirk knew over the years she may have been the sweetest. When she said Do you have to go? combined with the music I could really feel the pain she must have felt at not being able to have him stay with her.<br /><br />Someone commented online that Ruth looked older than he was yet she wasnt supposed to have aged at all in 15 years. Which makes me think... MAYBE she was one of the teachers at the academy. Kirk had an affair with an older woman! (Perhaps he thought back to this in MIRI when he told Janice I never get involved with older women. Maybe he meant ...anymore.<br /><br />Reading ST reviews the other day I see where someone compared WHAT ARE LITTLE GIRLS MADE OF? with I MUDD. But it seems SHORE LEAVE oughta be in there too. What are all those people if not androids? And could The Caretaker be related to The Old Ones from the earlier episode? Whoever he is he seems to be one of the RARE cases in ST where you have a race that is actually superior as opposed to merely thinking they are.<br /><br />Yeoman Barrows seems to be filling in for Yeoman Rand. Considering how much attention Dr. McCoy showered on her its just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again! Sheesh.<br /><br />One thing missing from the last several Ive watched that snuck back in here was Spock smiling. He was! I saw him. I really prefer knowing theres 2 sides to him going on inside all the time rather than this submerged business. When he said Enjoy yourself sir. near the beginning you could see it wasnt just his addressing his superior officer but talking to his friend. And at the end when he needlessly says Totally illogical! I cant help but think he does it purely to provoke a reaction. He may not be smiling or laughing but I think he likes seeing his fellow crew members around him happy.',pos
'If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli Okkadu you will find this to be very similar in story line but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not Andra pradesh. Although this is a remake of Okkadu you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique film Vijay and Trisha make a great pair. A few negatives were when Vijays character slaps Trishas character for going to buy a present for him he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end. Good action and songs make this an all around great movie I recommend it.<br /><br />I give it a 10/10 one of the best I have seen.',pos
'Ive read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi-noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems in the cruel light of 2007 a very sloppy late-RKO assembly-line product. All that endless documentary footage of fish waves fish waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time. The editing is downright careless: Scenes just end and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialog bears the stilted traces of the Odets origins: high-flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people. But whats really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is on all sides. I love Stanwyck but she snarls and contorts and lashes out wildly -- an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard. Douglas overplaying at being lovable then goes onto a would-be murderous rampage and is similarly hammy as is Ryan snarling and shouting most unnaturally. The less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes whose character is kind of a Neanderthal by todays standards nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as Stanwycks (much younger one presumes) brother and Marilyn Monroe as his girlfriend is natural and unaffected. On Montereys windswept coast (and all that Monterey footage while largely irrelevant is interesting as a document of what the town looked like) amid all the overheated hysteria these two are islands of sanity. A final point and a spoiler: Perhaps the Breen Office mandated it but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second? Stanwyck may temporarily have regressed into being an obedient wifey but I give the marriage a month.',neg
'Devils Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot (Gee that is one lucky pizza boy) and those without (Anal Amateurs 36). Devils Experiment falls solidly into the latter category. <br /><br />It is of course the horror version of hardcore porn. An almost completely plot less 43-minute wait for the money shot. Shot on video in 1985 it consists of three relatively non-descript Japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive Japanese girl. The tortures range from the banal (slapping her 50 times kicking her a hundred) the silly (tying her to an office chair and spinning her around) the fear factor (a bath of maggots and sheep guts) and finally the money shot. (A well executed eyeball piercing). <br /><br />Thats it no plot no motive just Blair Witch tree shots and torture. The girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling no one expects the Spanish Inquisition during the office chair scene I was bored silly. Staring dumbfounded at the screen waiting for the money shot. Just like hardcore porn.',neg

'This films kind of like Conan the Barabarian but with more sex rape and murder. There is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers dont do a good job showing it which is a shame because it could be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role as does the villain - who sadly didnt appear in anything else of note. The fight scenes arent too bad either - I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword drink the blood of his victims - and theres plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout. <br /><br />All in all not good - but not necessarily that bad either...',neg
'The line of course is from the Lords Prayer - Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Sweden especially its far north is not my idea of heaven -30 degree C winter temperatures are a little on the low side for me but the good folk who live there no doubt think they are in Gods own country.<br /><br />The storyline here is a familiar one. Acclaimed international musician Daniel suffers health breakdown in mid-career goes back to the little village in northern Sweden where he was born. Persuaded by the local pastor to help out with the church choir he turns some unlikely talent into a class act and they enter a contest held in Innsbruck Austria. There are echoes (sorry) of the band players of Brassed Off the models of Calendar Girls and the dancers of the Full Monty. But of course he causes plenty of emotional upheaval as some of the more downtrodden villagers realise their worth and revolt against their oppressors. He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor but nothing except death is going to stop him.<br /><br />Despite the somewhat corny story we get to know and like many of the characters who come across as people rather than caricatures despite many of them being recognisable types. I did wonder about the wife-beater being unpunished for so long  Sweden is one country in the world where such violence is pretty strongly discouraged (he was also a bit young to be one of the bullies of Daniels youth) and the puritanical pastor with a secret passion for girlie magazines was a bit of a stereotype but marvellously realised by Niklas Falk.<br /><br />Michael Nyqvist is simply wonderful as Daniel the frail but driven musician and theres some nice music as well. I was rapt for the whole two hours. The ending is what you make of it I guess but its not spoiling it to say Daniel achieves what he set out to do.',pos

'All you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late-60s period and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable. Once you get that message you may as well switch to another film.<br /><br />Daviess protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world--instead of living a fantasy film of which hes the imagined director--he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress hes idealized beyond reason. A couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here.<br /><br />The film is also interesting as documentation of Jason Schwartzmans fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore Schwartzmans annoying brattiness was something to be overcome but here its his characters only quality. Schwartzmans family connection clearly landed him in this role; heres hoping his choices improve.',neg
'The only part lacking in this movie is Shues part as the daughter wanting to follow in her aunts footsteps as a daytime soap star.

'I bought the DVD of this movie because I am a fan of William Devane and I was really disappointed about A Christmas Visitor. The story of the movie is so boring and slow in the development that you just want to turn off your TV or DVD player after about the half of it. The dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera but not in a TV movie. William Devane was alright in his part and he was acting quite good but he did so much better in other movies and projects. Meredith Baxter was horrible and couldnt really bring the warm hearted mother to the viewers. Instead she was playing very cool and wasnt better than a middle-class actress. I absolutely cannot recommend this movie. Spare your time and your money for this one.',neg

However there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at. If you are looking for an extremely funny hood movie then watch Friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that this movie tries at..kind of) watch something like hoop dreams or Jasons Lyric. If you are lookin for some good black booty go watch a Dominique Simone porn flick because the nudity in this movie is nearly non-existent.

'My wife and I watched this marvelous movie this evening because we will watch Russian Dolls tomorrow and the first is important to see before the second.<br /><br />We both loved The Spaniah Apartment and will enjoy following some of the characters through the early years of their lives-now in St. Pertersburg Russia. We both identified slightly with the rough framework of the story because we were students Florence Italy for us so the script was not completely foreign to our early lives. Our living was considerably different but as with this movie anytime you throw together young people passing through the same life-hoops as any developed world people they will experience much the same life situations. <br /><br />The collection of people and the personal difficulties that they faced were universals and therein lies the beauty of this film and probably its sequence that I will see tomorrow. As I wrote the characters as well as these situations are familiar to all of us and therefore we can enjoy living their lives for awhile. This must be one of the films great strengths-allowing the viewer to vicariously experience the emotional upheavals of the people involved and yet remain aloof. The viewer can through that distance chuckle to themselves thinking I wouldnt have done something that dumb or I would have avoided that trap. Maybe thats why we go to movies.',pos

'Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular the way Candice pronounces the words Puerto Rican is very funny as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie called Old Acquaintance starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along so because the movie is about female friendship that might have been a problem. Here the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supporting parts and are both excellent in particular Bochner who never got many decent parts in movies as far as I am concerned. George Cukor did not make another movie after this so this was a good one to go out on.',pos

'I was ready for a Crouching Tiger style movie and all I got was the worst movie ive seen in years. It was almost as bad as Baron Von Munchhuasen. Dead script. Dead acting.

'Råzone is an awful movie! It is so simple. It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon are by many still the little girl in krummernes Jul and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie!<br /><br />Even though i consider it a movie you ought to see. I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this but i think it can show how it can end if you are letting your child down. Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like Film folket!<br /><br />all in all I think people should see Råzone. Not because it is a great film but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it and actually it is in these scenes Laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the gun!',neg
'Next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes Graduation Day! All of those seniors just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. That is however IF they can make it TO graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic whos running around gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... Yeah it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later her older sister returns home from the Navy for Graduation. The track coach holds the blame and broods in his demoted position in shop-class while the girls boyfriend still mourns her death a year later... All of these characters are prime candidates for Serial Slasher of the Year and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who-done-it. Graduation Day is fun though it isnt spell-bindingly original by any means and there arent a whole lot of memorable demises but there is enough going on to keep you mildly entertained. Like Linnea Quigley screwing the music teacher and getting busted with a joint 30 year-old actors playing teenagers and of course... Rollerdisco! Gotta love that crap! You can do a lot worse than Graduation Day kiddies...',neg

Could have been so scary if it would have stuck to the facts. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? TERRIBLE MOVIE! Steve Railsback version was much much better. Dont waste a penny on this terribly made flick...

'E. Elias Merhiges Begotten is a one of a kind surreal depiction of the mankinds treatment of religion. There are a couple of different ways you can interpret things but the plot itself is simple: A god disembowels himself and out of his corpse springs mother earth. Mother Earth then felates the gods corpse post-mortem and then impregnates herself with what remains of his seed. Following this she gives birth to a messiah figure who quivers presumably in infancy but possibly with terror at being brought to life on earth. This all takes place in the first 15-30 minutes and after that the rest of the film consists of robed figures dragging the messiah (who is incessantly quivering or seizing) across a desert landscape. The robed figures pause only to brutalize the messiah then continue to drag him around.<br /><br />There are a couple of ways to interpret this depending on your level of optimism and your world view. It can easily be interpreted as a bleak nihilistic atheist allegory about the total lack of apparent power that Christian deities can be perceived as having in a modern society that only invokes their names to advance its own selfish goals. Or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro-Christian allegory in which you view the film as being about how mankind has twisted Christs message around so much that its original purity and innocence can no longer have relevance in a world where that message and image are inappropriately used to endorse everything from interpersonal violence to war to totalitarianism.<br /><br />The visuals of this film are phenomenal and you will not see anything like it period. If you can watch the original VHS release I recommend it. Im not sure if the visuals are changed on the DVD but I have seen clips of this streaming on you tube and the effects are seriously diminished. On the VHS version Merhige achieved TOTAL BINARY CONTRAST. Meaning there basically arent any mid-tones except for some grain in some of the shots. Other than that this film offers the rare opportunity to see PURE white and PURE black and the result is stunning hallucinatory and quite unsettling. This film makes Film Noir look positively washed out and mediocre. The shots fade into each other in a surreal manner that recalls Un Chien Andalou without completely aping it for an effect that has been called a filmic Rorschach test.<br /><br />That being said the film can certainly try a viewers patience and commitment. There isnt any dialogue for starters. The only sound throughout the film is a fairly constant loop of crickets chirping peppered occasionally with the gurgling and death rattles of the dying deities and an amelodic droning synthesizer texture. Personally I find that the film is best enjoyed listening to experimental industrial music like the instrumental NIN remixes from the Downward Spiral era more abstract noise/experimental music like F*ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. It also works quite well with apocalyptic black metal. Basically any music with extreme textures and/or hypnotic rhythms. Thats one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this film it is PRIME for postmodern re-contextualization like projecting it during a performance of avant-garde music or composing avant-garde music to accompany it.<br /><br />Once the messiah figure is born there really isnt much change for the rest of the film meaning that you are basically sitting through at least 45 minutes or more of the messiah figure being drug around the desert and beaten. It looks bleakly beautiful but there isnt really anything new unfolding. It helps to cement the filmmakers intentions of communicating that for thousands of years now people have been using Christs name and image for personal benefits but can be tiresome to a casual viewer or someone with a short attention span. Basically if you are looking for a modern horror film with suspense look elsewhere. If you are looking for a unique film experience and you arent particularly fond of mainstream Hollywood cinema this could be your quivering messiah.',pos
'Get the CD instead. The show is tame and the editing sucks. The crowd gets way too much screen time as does Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time on the same kid shaking his head around in the same way (which leads me to believe its the exact same shot) than they do during Richard Kruspes solo in Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so quickly its impossible to tell where the camera is pointed and the replays are simply redundant. Not worth the tape its recorded on.',neg
'So American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series. Although it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (cant that guy get better gigs?).<br /><br />There is very little to compliment this movie on. There arent any funny jokes. The acting is painful to watch especially the girl with the southern accent which sounds more like a Canadians impersonation of a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word yall. This movie makes me feel like such an idiot. Why didnt I apply to a college where nobody goes to class (but everybody gets good grades) girls consistently take their clothes off in public everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs and you can ejaculate all over a girls family photos without her minding? Really this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn. Maybe for the next one theyll finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as the lead. Im sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character Stiflers 3rd uncle once removed or something like that.',neg
'Well SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea and despite the mostly negative responses Ive heard to it and the suspiciously tardy DVD release I couldnt help but pick it up - any wu xia film is better than most non-wu xia films in my eyes :D Perhaps low expectations were an advantage because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable.<br /><br />An assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne and the governments top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit. This doesnt take particularly long but the answer is not one he wanted to hear. Through prolonged flashbacks we learn why and the history of the swordsman and the assassin and of the revolution.<br /><br />The film is typically melodramatic for a Korean film and resolutely serious in tone - no HK style comedy moments to be found here. The story can be a little difficult to follow at first but all makes sense eventually. The film goes a bit wobbly at the end but no worse than a Chang Cheh film might do and for the most part I found it enjoyable. The production values are high with some good cinematography to capture it. The fight scenes arent up to the calibre of the better HK wu xia films but perhaps theyre not meant to be - the fights are more realistic in that theyre less like choreographed dance routines but theres some wirework and occasional cgi that put the film in wu xia mode. The film doesnt have the best cast unfortunately with the leads being a tad lacking in charm and occasionally difficult to distinguish from each other. Theres a young lady in the film that I dont think Ive seen before but makes the best impression of any of the principle cast - not just because you see her nekkid... or perhaps it is :p The film lacks the charm and grace of the better HK wu xia films and perhaps the beauty too but I only wish HK would make them half this good anymore - TWINS EFFECT 2 does not give me hope that *thats* about to happen any time soon though Tsui Hark surely still has it in him if he can get the funding and cast. SWORD IN THE MOON is not going to go onto my list of favourite wu xia by any means but its a whole heap better than ROMANTIC WARRIORS or LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE - perhaps better than BICHUNMOO too though I did like that film quite a bit more on a second viewing. Obviously its nowhere near the wonderful MUSA but its a different affair altogether really. SITM will probably get a second viewing within three years which is perhaps the best indicator of how much I liked it :) 7/10',pos
'I heard this film was much more stylistic than the films director Guy Ritchie (Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Snatch) had directed before the problem is it is possibly too stylistic. Basically Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitaryand within two years he gambles loads of his money. He is ready to seek revenge against the violence-prone casino owner who got Jake sent to prison Dorothy Mr. D Macha (Ray Liotta). In the process doctors tell Jake that he has three days left to live as he is dying from a rare blood disease oh and Macha puts hit men on him. Loan sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (André Benjamin) are demanding Jake pays their cash back and do some odd jobs for them. The film is filled with Jake narrating through some flashbacks and through his last three days before coming to the big revelation about Zach and Avi and Macha well I assume thats what it was. Also starring Terence Maynard as French Paul Andrew Howard as Billy Mark Strong as Sorter Francesca Annis as Lily Walker Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. The are sequences involving a little bit of animation repeating lines twice in different perspectives and changing speeds for moments and all of these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom making it a silly crime drama. Pretty poor!',neg
'Now this is what Id call a good horror. With occult/supernatural undertones this nice low-budget French movie caught my attention from the very first scene. This proves you dont need wild FX or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie.<br /><br />The plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison and each of these characters (and their motives) become gradually more interesting as the movie builds up tension to the finale. Most of the action we see through the eyes of Carrere who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates.<br /><br />I wont say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen. There a few flaws though: the FX are not that good but theyre used effectively; the plot leaves some mysteries open; and things get very confusing towards the end but Malefique redeems itself by the time its over.<br /><br />I thought his was a very good movie 8/10',pos

And the real people these real places were named for are probably struggling out of the Earth seeking vengeance over this trite little flick. Disney youre based out of California & Florida right amidst the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country. If you cant stick to what you know at least hire and/or work with people who know what area youre trying to caricuture. Maybe then it wouldnt be so insulting! :(',neg
'If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared Death in Venice would have to be it. It is a monument in movie history. Much criticized for being slow boring and too obvious in stating its point (an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed first mentally then physically) we should appreciate this movie for what it is. Morte a Venezia was shot over 30 years ago and it portrays a period even further back at the beginning of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Life was slow then compared to now. People were supposed to behave in a certain way hiding their true emotions even from themselves. Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde the leading actor admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach in his time this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with. We see his inner struggle mostly on the face of Bogarde against the beautiful backdrop of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music composed by Gustav Mahler.<br /><br />This movie is slow there is no denying it. No special effects car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats. No perverted sex scenes either; the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile.<br /><br />So basically nothing much happens in this movie? Not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum. If you want them to be played like the strings of a violin in a romantic concerto this is the movie to do it.',pos

You dont need to read them just watch them and catch the performance of In the Navy by the Village People...and friends.',pos
'With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew They all laughed is very much a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.If this all smacks of smug in - joke self gratification you will be pleased to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent I love N.Y. paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients affairs - is of minimal importanceit is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie. Mr Bogdanovichs triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actorsfrom Targets onwards.There is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directorsprincipally Who the hells in it? recently remaindered in UK bookstores. The soundtrack to They all laughed varies from Louis Armstrongs 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latinas eclectic as the city it portrays. Mr Bs Golden Boy image was sure to tarnishfor such is the nature of the movie businessbut it is equally sure one day to be restoredand when that day comes They all laughed will be recognised for the fine work that it is.',pos
'This film aka the four hundred blows is a mistranslation.Faire les 400 coups meansto live a wild life.

'Heres yet another film from the 80s that most people just dont know exists. This slow picturesque (the loving shots of the Montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of Costners recent Open Range which also starred Robert Duval) and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you cant sleep or on a listless Sunday afternoon. Those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting. The performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced. Glenn Close Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals as are all the supporting players and young actors. I especially liked how director Cain (who unfortunately hasnt directed anything of note since this except the first Young Guns) gives us quiet little glimpses into everyones personal grief. We dont just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents but also the confused middle sister the wayward uncle his crazy wife and the dead teenagers girlfriend. What we essentially get here is the rural Mid-Western answer to Ordinary People. Theres also shades of David Lynchs The Straight Story in some of the stoic downhome Mid-West morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit. This is one of the better and more realistic tear-jerkers of the era and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there.',pos

'The Triumph of Love doesnt triumph over anything. It is a plodding ponderous 4 hours of torture. Actually its a little less than 2 hours long it just seemed much longer. It pains me to even think about the amateurish performances of such fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are not quite as awful. Maybe they were trying to be so over the top so as to be clownish but if so I didnt see it that way. Mira Sorvino doesnt make an impression one way or the other. She(he)s just there. My guess is the play of the same name written by Marivaux some 270 or so years ago is much better. It couldnt be any worse. Clare Peploe the writer and director of this movie was inspired by a recent production of the play. I dont know what she was thinking when she created this bomb. <br /><br />Maybe it all got lost in the translation.',neg
'The Thing About my Folks came in as a surprise. We had no idea about what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta and based on a screen play by one of its stars Paul Reiser proved to be a pleasant time at the movies. Although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome this is a voyage of discovery where Ben gets to know his father perhaps for the first time in his life Ben sees his father for what he really is and not the mythical figure he has in his mind.<br /><br />The film seems to be a vehicle for its star Peter Falk and he runs away with the movie as it was expected. Mr. Falk one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years is an actor of such stature he must be reckoned with. As Sam Kleinman the distant father to Ben he is a man that clearly is misunderstood not only by Ben but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty-seven years.<br /><br />When Muriel the matriarch of the Kleinman clan runs away everyone goes into a panic because this woman who has been the strong figure of the family is vital to keep everyone together. Not knowing where she has gone Sam shows up at Bens house confused as he feels abandoned suddenly by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years.<br /><br />Ben the youngest son takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of Manhattan into the country. The trip provides the excuse for Ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son. Along the way father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children. The love of Sam for Muriel spans the many years they have known one another; they seem inseparable.<br /><br />Peter Falk is magnificent in the film. He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst. Mr. Falk shines as the older man and theres never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him.<br /><br />Not being a Paul Reiser fan we must confess that as Ben Kleinman he is right. Ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for Muriel the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is only seen at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style..<br /><br />The film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of Dan Gillham and the excellent musical score by Steven Argila. Ultimately the film shows a great team effort between its director Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser who wrote it for the screen.<br /><br />Although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience it should please anyone.',pos

'I dont know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture Oscar. All I know is that fortunately there was Gene Kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as I believe it is. First of all I dont think Leslie Caron was really fit to play such a role. She isnt that talented she isnt a great dancer and shes not good looking at all. Its a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if Leslie Caron hadnt been in this it might have made a terrific movie. The story was intelligent the directing wasnt bad and as I said Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now Im not saying all this stuff about Leslie Caron just to criticize her Im just saying it because I think thats what the worse part of the movie is.

Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor I especially loved the Believer. Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film presented an interesting view on life and death. It was very touching and very sad yet it kept me interested which most touching stories cannot do. It is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it you should see it.

'I dont go for that many heist comedies and I might not care for this one if it werent for the actors when it was made and when I FIRST SAW it (just a few years later). Its almost too similar to The Happening (even though its obviously a much less serious comedy than that one) - Mafia figure takes over his own kidnapping or rather turns it in a different direction altogether. Of course Raquel Welch didnt play the kind of sharp character Faye Dunaway did in The Happening but that doesnt make it a sexist film either - she was practically playing a stock character almost HER version of a moll! But Im completely biased - its among the first films I ever saw with her and at the time I saw it you couldnt turn around without seeing a poster of her (luckily). I think Robert Wagner was really just right as the neither thoroughly likable nor dis-likable leader of the group as were Edward G. Robinson (naturally) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge an actor who always managed to be funny.',pos
'Dont be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story on this seems rather interesting with speculative hints. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the absolute most sad movie experience Ive ever had... It is plain and right AWFUL and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot seems intriguing reflect on this: telephones can move run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance. It can throw things at you haunt you and run after you. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE it is a disgrace for the horror genre...',neg
'<br /><br />As a Harold Lloyd fan i agree with the other reviewers comments EXCEPT that I feel that Movie Crazy was his best sound film; Cats Paw is a close second. (But this is just MY opinion).<br /><br />This film is a hoot from beginning to end and in many scenes George Barbier (the crook that gets him elected mayor) almost steals the show! (Especially at the end of the film).<br /><br />One wishes that Una Merkels character would be a bit more sympathetic to Harold especially as the film progresses. Only in the last few minutes of the film do we find out her true feelings for him. (And even then there is no romance - kissing etc).<br /><br />This is a Must-See film!',pos
'When you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old Amitabh Bachchan romances a 34-yr old Tabu. Wait! In fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of cheeni it is the content that is Kum in this Adman turned Writer-Director R. Balkis maiden effort..<br /><br />Trust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise-cracks and bitter-sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half. The locales of London as captured in rainy season are captivating. By the end of first half romance completed and mission accomplished. There is not much left to be said. Therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girls father to the extent that he goes for a Satyagrah is really a test of patience. There is an equally strange climax about how he gives in. The result second half is dry flat with no energy. There is a subplot with a girl child dying of cancer not making much impact. Nonetheless the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances.',neg
'This is a well-worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangmans noose then sets about taming his reluctant bride. It manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time. We never find out for example why a woman who won the respect of an Indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband. Or why the members of her team are so eager to get a real man in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own. This only made sense in fifties Hollywood.<br /><br />Theres a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip--the second time--then yanks her off her horse. Never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip! Then he prevails in a fight against her Indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp. Thats some second wind. Later he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty Indians (as they all are in these flicks) after they reject her now shes his squaw. Never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and shes been negotiating with them for years. And the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him--yeah right. Like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail.<br /><br />Finally neither of the leads is convincing in their roles. Madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky. Fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy. The only reason youd root for her is because you want to see Madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the films end. The way that Madison tames Fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow-up dolls. Even if you do see them as dolls the total lack of suspense will bore you.<br /><br />Total waste of time. Even the scenerys kinda dull. Give this one a big miss.',neg
'My God this was a fantastic film. Every time we watch it takes us to another place of WOW. Rhett & Scarlett were played brilliantly by Joanne & Timothy.

If u loved Gone With The Wind you will love this mini series. Go Rhett!!! Go Scarllett!!!',pos
'Towards the end of the movie I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea. I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. I guess I should have figured that out before but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic. The acting was pretty good since theyre mostly seasoned professionals but if youre going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen it should be more like a fantasy comical etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot with Buck Rogers the night stalker and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with well known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature. Thats why I said it should have been more comical. My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about. They walk around with drinks setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later just as if theyre in a building or something and acting as if turbulence just doesnt exist. Also I know its a disaster movie but suspense doesnt have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something. Anyway the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after its first screening. I like Lee Grant but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked...:)',neg

'Man I never laugh so much this year and its pretty hard to make me laugh. While I expected some Hostel-style movie the smile came to my face even from the beginning. This film-inside-film shows a female stabbed victim messing the whole set until she finally die. Her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us the viewers that Mute Witness is not a typically horror movie.<br /><br />The main character the mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes is played by the beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. Her performance is top-notch; her character cant speak so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate.And oh boy she did a wonderful job. Her sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or the fiancée or the wife of the in-film director (Evan Richards). They were both very funny most of the time. I wont spoil more but the scenes following the bathtub moment with them two the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy.<br /><br />The plot get twisted near the end possibly misleading at one particular moment. But dont worry. Such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-/girl-/friend.',pos

'Of course this came out right at the beginning of the 1980s. Of course it did. Those drama students dancing in the street to Irene Caras famous theme song its an indelible eighties leg-warmer style image. But theres more to the film than that.

'WINCHESTER 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) obsessed with getting back his prized possession a repeating rifle made by Winchester. The rifle keeps changing hands and Stewart doggedly keeps after it. This 1950 B&W effort by Anthony Mann is more a crime film than a traditional western and the cowboys often seem more like modern-day gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is headed for a ranch with a man (Charles Drake) she may marry. She ends up falling for Stewart but not before she is passed around a bit. Winters is the most complex character in a film filled with unusual characters. Watch for a young Dan Dureyea as a nutty killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role. A woefully miscast Will Geer plays Wyatt Earp.',pos
'surely this film was hacked up by the studio? perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad criminal indeed writing and directing.<br /><br />i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the stylised acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhands but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of tropes but only the offensive tripe of affectation. ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale.<br /><br />finally not that scary indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless horseman would suffice no need for the myth about a german mercenary although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing - seeing the horsemans head makes him seem far friendlier that a decapitated inhuman nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend.<br /><br />no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in burtons oevure. stilted and clipped as my parting shot...',neg

'If youre going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright William Shakespeare? And if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most heinous crimes you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals. In a Kentucky Correctional Prison a courageous project such as this was undertaken with amazing results. This film shows how it was all done.the casting.the rehearsals.the set and costumesand the final presentation of Shakespeares play The Tempest. It had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison. In the play the ship-wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world. Prison life too is much like that.<br /><br />With a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience may be not quite as Shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure.<br /><br />More interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character. One inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins. It was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder shooting and strangulation. One had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions. However (as someone said) the past was past and the present was the beginning of a new future. At least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events.<br /><br />The prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place. Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone stands to benefitnot only the Kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole.',pos
'The story idea behind THE LOST MISSILE isnt bad at all but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub-par level.<br /><br />The film begins with a missile heading towards the Earth. In a panic because its about to strike the Earth the Soviets manage to deflect the object. This isnt necessarily good however as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path AND the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet. In other words with each pass it makes a swath of death follows--one that could potentially kill us all!! So its up to the good scientists of the US (led by a very young and hardly recognizable Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan to save us--and especially save New York that is in its immediate flight path! Unfortunately they arent able to save Ottawa (Ive never been there so I cant say whether or not this is a big loss) but thanks to good old American know-how they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction!! <br /><br />So as you can see the story idea isnt bad and rather original. But so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding. Overall a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like--all others see it at your own risk.',neg
'This film has an excellent premise and is really crying out to be turned into a Hollywood blockbuster. As I recall (and its a few years since Ive seen the film) the action starts with a London omnibus filled with people. There is an horrific crash and one passenger dies. The rest of the film is then told in flashback with 13 characters who were on the bus getting their recent lives explored in intricate detail. At the end of the film we return to the crash and find out which of these chirpy vivid characters has met a gruesome end. Great stuff a little like a good tabloid news story fleshed out in precise even handed detail. If only it were available on video...',pos
'I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting guess who game. The movie however needs more Robin in it. He appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest. I always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new Robin character let alone Knightwing. This movie just continues that bad tradition. The movie spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance which wouldnt be so bad in one movie if the romance wasnt so unbelievable. It is still a good movie if you are a Batman fan and I would recommend watching it.',pos
'This is the first feature film from Australian comedian Mick Molloy. Mick wrote the film with his brother Richard with help from John Clarke another comedian and actor. Mick & John also have starring roles along with several other iconic Australian actors - Bill Hunter Frank Wilson et al. The basic premise of the movie is that slimy Jack Simpson (Mick Molloy) has become a member of a Lawn Bowls Club for the sole purpose of getting a free car park near his work. The Club is in dire financial straits and calls on Jack to help. John Clarke plays the clubs arch nemesis - he is trying to take the club over and turn it into a Poker Machine Slum Jack and the other club members band together to try and save the club with many funny twists and turns and Jacks eventual redemption. This is quite a clever little movie. It is well above Mick Molloys usual gutter humor. It is pretty well written and well acted. The older Aussie actors are brilliant (Bill Hunter Frank Wilson Monica Maughan and ors) The film meanders along rather then going at break neck pace but that adds to the charm of the movie. There is low level coarse language.',pos
'Horses on Mars is an engaging animated short that takes a sometimes comical look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those yet to evolve. The story is personal and at times sentimental and is supported by strong digital animation and narration that involves the viewer in this science fiction story. I was fortunate enough to view this short in widescreen format at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival and must suppose that when transferred to the small screen it will lose some of its ability to draw the reader into the no less thoughtful story and stunning graphics.',pos

'Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue Jarrell gets involved without realising hes about to embark on a fantastical journey one that involves peril and worst of all the demon Sardo Numspa.<br /><br />Is The Golden Child a product of its time? by that i mean was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Childs popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?. For i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade its box office was $79817937 making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986 but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny Eddie Murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. The Golden Child is not up with the more accepted 80s Murphy pictures like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains Murphy at his wisecracking quipping and charming best! seriously!.<br /><br />Cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981 The Golden Child hits all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury dashing villain {Charles Dance so English i could kiss him myself} wonderful colour and a cute kid with mystical powers the film only asks you to get involved in the fun not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. Yes the CGI demon looks creaky now and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s 90s and beyond but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious seriously. 7/10',pos

'****MINOR SPOILERS*** As a bad movie connoisseur I must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet Hobgoblins stands apart from all others in its own unique way. Classic baddies such as The Creeping Terror The Mighty Gorga and Manos are uniformly bad from start to finish. Hobgoblins on the other hand starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes. During my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene I thought to myself that this was a truly bad film. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer. The movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept Club Scum sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another. With just this one film director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? Watch Hobgoblins and wonder no longer.',neg
'The Rainmaker released in 1956 - has some of the finest actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster being the principle players. Not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama. First of all Hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress not even she can pull this off. She is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton and was just too old for the part. Lancaster over acts to the extreme and Earl Holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much. It seems like the 1950s was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress and that is fine. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (me being among them) she didnt make too many of them. Despite an A-list cast and good production values it doesnt work.',neg
'An absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage Russian animation pioneer Wladyslaw Starewiczs Mest kinematograficheskogo operatora (The Cameramans Revenge or The Revenge of a Kinematograph Cameraman) is a delight of early animation brimming with highly-effective stop-motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. Beetle have a completely uneventful marriage and both yearn for more excitement in their lives. Mr. Beetles desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the Gay Dragonfly night club whom he visits whenever he takes a business trip to the city. She is the only one who understands him. A fellow admirer of this dancer an aggressive grasshopper is jealous that Mr. Beetle has stolen his lady and as fate would have it he is also a movie cameraman. The devious grasshopper follows Mr. Beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room where he films their exploits through the keyhole.<br /><br />Meanwhile Mrs. Beetle has likewise acquired a friend to add excitement to her life. He is an artist and he brings her a painting for a present before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy. At that moment however Mr. Beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle. As Mr. Beetle bashes through the front door the artist friend clambers up the chimney but he doesnt escape without Mr. Beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him.<br /><br />There is a certain irony in the statement that follows: Mr. Beetle is generous. He forgives his wife and takes her to a movie. He is generous enough to forgive her and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier. At this point in time however we still havent forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film Mr. and Mrs. Beetle are attending. Suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of Mr. Beetles disloyalty and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper.<br /><br />In the final scene both Mr. and Mrs. Beetle now somewhat more appreciative of each other are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when Mr. Beetle sought his final revenge. We do indeed hope that the home life of the Beetles will be less exciting in the future This film may appear to be a mere story of the comings-and-goings of a miniscule insect species but Starewicz is communicating so much more than that. This isnt a story about beetles  it is a story about us. And its startlingly accurate isnt it?!',pos
'Generally speaking Im a an admirer of Jess Francos film-making but for some of this movies I really have difficulties understanding the motivation behind them or even their reason of existence. Like this sick puppy for example. Sadomania has absolutely no cinematic value its poorly made without any sort of plot and featuring some of the most ill-natured sleaze footage ever captured on film. This is another filthy women-in-prison film where rape lesbian-action and violent torture games are daily routine. The guards are crazier than the prisoners and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only gets sexually aroused when he spots a girl having sex with a dog (!). The girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the entire film yet you cant really enjoy this sight with all the perversion going on. The dubious highlights include a barbaric hunting game (you can guess what he prey is) a duel-to-death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl having a needle injected all the way through her nipple.

So the wogg-iness has been diluted a lot - they even sound like true-blue Aussies - not a flicker of the dago accent anywhere ( there theres another slang for ya Nun! )<br /><br />Maoris with sunnies (sunglasses) at 4am - must be cool to be sun-blinded in the middle of the night and it looks like Redfern... this is at this movies tedious end. Nunzio tried to copy the flavor of the Warriors but left too many holes in the story. How about coincidences ?<br /><br />The warriors had a gang of baseball guys wielding bats with white face makeup chase the heroes to a train station and fight them - Nunzios gang get chased on a railway station by a gang of stick wielding guys wearing whitish face masks. The warriors were mistakenly accused of shooting/murdering another gang-member -- Nunzios gang are mistakenly accused of raping the sister of the big Maori gang boss. The warriors are lured into a room by a gang of girls who attack them - Nunzios crowd want to crash at a friends house which is populated by yep a gang of girls -- there are almost too many copies from the Warriors to keep on about here.<br /><br />I am saddened that people dont want to see other moves from OZ because of this tripe - how about Mad Max - Commander and Master of the World? Not all movies are made by actors who are so bad they have to fund their own movies. <br /><br />As far as the other actors in this show are concerned they seem to have taken their cue from the Nun as they all are as bad as each other - dont bother with this movie!

'Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the D.A. in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen. The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic integrity and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again. The music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience.',pos

'First of all this was not a three hour movie - Two hours ten minutes... last time i checked commercials arent actually part of a movie! Perhaps though it shouldve been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? Yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion. Overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of Lucy and Desi. I watch I Love Lucy from time to time and love it but never have I read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen. Because of this movie I do now but Im not so sure thats a good thing. Everything here no one really needed to know. This was essentially a movie that didnt need to be made. But it was made and the reason is because Lucy & Desi are still such huge stars and certain people in American society feel that the rest of society needs to know ALL about our tv and movie stars. That is definitely so not true and very very sad.<br /><br />Anyway what was shown here in Lucy was pretty good. Two complaints - the actress who played Viv Vance - not great casting at all. And the switch from Madeline Zima to Rachel York.... uhhh like Lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden shes a whole new person!? That wasnt too great. But the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between Lucy & Desi. No the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasnt necessarily a drawback to this movie because like I said this focused mainly just on Lucy & Desi. Had there been more time had the story been more about Lucys entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more. But they werent so we got to see the likes of Gable & Lombard Red Skelton and Buster Keaton very briefly instead. Wow that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in Lucys life. Really neat and its too bad that wasnt explored more. Oh well. What was explored was done well for the most part. Honestly I dont think Ill ever watch this again and I dont think this moviell be that memorable.

He lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger caused him to do deadly things. <br /><br />When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle. There was a fair amount of gore but not too much for the weak stomached.<br /><br />Not for people who like the regular old Hollywood movie but for those who enjoy independent films. Kinda got the feeling of an Asian fantasy film.',pos
'This unintentionally amusing mid-80s TV movie is based on the premise that sex bomb Donna Mills (in a mostly appalling wardrobe throughout) is a neglected housewife pining for her sexy past as a cheerleader. She escapes her empty life by fantasising about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she comes across finally giving into her fantasies and indulging in a bit on the side although all she really wants is to reignite the flames of passion with her boring husband James Brolin.<br /><br />There are many laughable aspects to this film Mills first foray into co-producing (later following her departure from Knots Landing she found great success as a trashy TV movie queen starring in mostly issue-of-the-week melodramas through most of the 90s - she usually played a victim of some sort clearly determined to wash her hands of the wonderfully wicked and entertaining conniver she played for so long on Knots). Funniest are the drawn-out fantasy sequences filmed as though they are meant to be soft-core porn (wind and smoke machines backlighting porno music) but as this is a network TV movie the scenes are all very chaste and ultimately not very sexy at all. The most amusing (and bizarre) scene has Mills taking a walk on the wild side downtown among the spiky-haired punks (complete with Robert Palmer soundtrack). <br /><br />Less laughable is the dreadful dialogue that the cardboard characters are forced to utter (pity poor Cicely Tyson as the mandatory psycho-analyst or Veronica Cartwright as the mandatory best friend or even pre-Babs James Brolin with that daytime soap style of clenched fist anger.)<br /><br />Of course as in all of these sorts of films we learn that all problems can be solved through psycho-therapy and then the film just becomes silly as we explore briefly the reasons for Mills shocking behaviour (as if it cant just be that she wants a good shag!)<br /><br />Vacuous.',neg
'This was by far the best war documentary ever made. From the very beginning of the first episode when Sir Laurence Olivier described the horrific events in Oradour-Sur-Glane The day the soldiers came. To the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over Japan I never missed a second of this classic series and I remember it well even though it was screened way back in 1974. Each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail. This whole series should be compulsory viewing for as many of the worlds children as possible so that the tragedy of World War Two is not repeated and that bigotry hatred greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.',pos
'It seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence. In fact violence both disturbing and cartoonish is the last of Oldboys deep flaws. The characters are unidimensional underdeveloped primitive. The intensity an obsession and a goal in itself with this director is served up with the cheapest of means. Lets not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth. By the end of the movie it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of horror to continue to shock an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap-opera revelations already served up in big bunches. It would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash. Imagine Homer Simpson hesitating in front of the cinema theater: should I go in or should I buy five cones of ice-cream for the same money? Be smart Homer go for the ice-cream.',neg
'Just lovely. It is long. No climax. Dont wait for anything to happen. Great for a rainy day. About a man in a mid life crisis who takes his family to a secluded area of the Greek isles. I saw this in my teens and still love it 20+ years later. I have been unable to find it in video stores however. Molly Ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then kind of settles into the place. There are no phones no TV boredom which when hit with quietness like that the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect. And each character does so. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with John Cassavetes character but he is unable to well you know. Gina Rowlands is the wife that loves him but is just about to give up on their marriage. He is demanding and frustrating to everyone. There is another character in the movie a Greek who talks to Molly Ringwald inappropriately about sex but things that she is curious about. But he is irritating and horny and i didnt like this character. The locale of the film is what makes this film so so good. It wouldnt work if filmed anywhere else. I recommend this film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.',pos
'I was pleasantly pleased with the ending. I just saw this movie yesterday and was going to turn it off but changed my mind. It was not at all the direction I thought the story would end on. Thats about all positive I can say about this film. All of the actors are nobodys especially the lead. While she is an attractive young woman shell never make it big. The writing direction and acting are wooded sort of like what you would see on daytime soaps. The filming locations were very clever in making you think it could be anywhere instead of blatantly tipping off it was in Canada. As this was shot entirely in Canada Im assuming the entire lot was Canadien which is not entirely bad as some recent Canadien TV productions: Cold Squad Stone; Underover are quite well done.',neg
'Upon completing this infernal piece of trash a friend and I swore a solemn vow never to again speak of how we had just trashed away the last 90 minutes of our lives. This film is completely pointless a two dimensional hero and heroin who we cant give a hoot whether or not they survive and some of the lamest villains to ever darken the screen of horror (or any other) genre. To further prove just how absolutely pointless this film was I would have liked to add a plot synopsis but I cant write fiction. All and all the only reason I can think of that anyone would ever want to view this film is if they had just murdered their entire community and is looking for some self afflicted punishment that will haunt you for all following years to come!',neg
'The Salena Incident is by far the director Dustin Rikerts best film --- which isnt saying much. In his past films (and I use the term films loosely) the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them. The Salena Incident is no different. The movie is basically Con Air meets Aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production. The film is riddled with out-of-focus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes. For example almost every on-screen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screen.<br /><br />The weak effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue. In a sentence the story strings together like an exposition of overused Hollywood clichés. The movie begins with the worst CGI Alien ship ever made crashing into the worst CGI earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate. Next a bus of prison transports carrying the worst of the worst from across the state is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicon implants. The prisoners escape and run into the town of Salena where they encounter the aliens who... SHOCK... have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy. The prisoners and their captive police armed with only guns and sad puns have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the International Space Alliance *rolls eyes* bombs the city into oblivion.<br /><br />The only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a flurry of gun fire. Other than that the movie really isnt worth anyones time let alone the plastic that the DVD is made out of. How awful was it? Lets just say the Secretary of Defense is about 90 years old works in a room that is about as high tech 1950s real estate office and is wearing a Looney Tunes tie. Yes if that wasnt clear enough before THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE PENTAGON IS WEARING A TIE WITH BUGS BUNNY AND THE ROAD RUNNER ON IT. The movie basically culminates (HAHAHahhaaa did I say culminates...) with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens --- which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the Alien ship? yeah...<br /><br />The movie has heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work. Someone seriously needed to slap the DP and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive stagnant chest-level shots. This movie really isnt worth renting (if it ever makes it that far) being that its not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which reduces the laugh-ability but its nowhere near watchable cinema.',neg
'*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy itI laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger) a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seenshe follow her true love for a soap series characterDr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film. And here comes the big question.What is the film all about? The reference to The Wizard of Oz is obvious.Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas however while Dorothy come at the end of that film to the conclusion that there is no place like home Betty doesnt come to any conclusion and by the end of the film we are left wonder what has she learned from her experience and the answer is simply nothing.It seems not to affect her at all.<br /><br />Than is the film about the different between reality and fantasy? could bebut the scenes that are dealing with this subject are short and serve no more than a joke and not as a serious plot line that can take the film to other places.(and by the way The Truman Show dealt with this subject in a much better way).<br /><br />The film could be about obsession.Betty is obsessed with the soap series and Charlie(Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty.LaBute show two sides of obsession and he seems to forget that obsessionin any form is dangerousand should be condemned.He seems to have sympathy to Bettys obsession because he sees it as a harmless one.<br /><br />All a long the film we have scenes that in itself could have been a subject for a whole filmbut are left for us to think about without that they will have impact on the characters.<br /><br />The ending is simply a make -up that has nothing to do with what we saw before.Its a shame because the film could have been sharper if he would have concentrate in one or two subjects.As it isits about a lot but actually say nothing.<br /><br />What we are left with is the feeling that we have seen a little filmamusing and weird that could have been much much more.',pos
'Well on the day that Rob Schneider plunges himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by starring in the absolutely not-at-all-wanted Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo (hmmmm....wasnt there a film called Roadtrip which was followed by a sequel called Eurotrip? And now theres Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo followed by sequel Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo.......I smell a pattern. Perhaps soon there will be Spiderman: European webs are Hotter.....or not) I am writing about this much maligned (at time of release) film. I was one of those maligners I must admit. I turned my nose up at it even while Chris Farley shoved cocaine up his nose and the SNL cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in 94-95 the Norm McDonald anchorship notwithstanding. Films like Happy Gilmore Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler films. However I watched this film the other day ten years after and 8 years after Chris died and could not stop laughing. Yes its not particularly sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny being Manny) but his Van Down By the River motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not wash enough or wear well-fitting clothes or use deodorant more than twice a week translates well here as the ever self-effacing character who realizes hes not the brightest not the best-looking and could stand to lose a few pounds. All the same hes trying his best to do what hes supposed to. And David Spade just tosses off his snide one-liners as he did for Spades Hollywood Minute and basically stings Farleys self-esteem. Theres really not a whole lot more to say than that. I love the one scene when Farley catches Spade spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it. Cant remember what the first one is but the second one theyre lying in their hotel beds and Farley says to Spade Do you like baseball?. Spade mutters something inaudible in response and Farleys says the New York YANK-ees? Anyway Farley does his awkward painfully sensitive frat-boy shtick. If you like you like it. I couldnt stop laughing.',pos
'I have seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I rather enjoyed it. Either way it wasnt that bad of a movie. Sure it moved a bit slow at times. I liked it.<br /><br />As far as MST3K goes they only did the movies they could get the rights for. Not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies it was just so easy to make fun of them. Take SoulTaker for example.<br /><br />Joe Estevez and Robert ZDars characters where so inanimate and boringly silly I couldnt help but laugh. I couldnt take them seriously. It really created a unique feeling though.<br /><br />Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script. A world better than 95\% of the garbage in the theatres today. Her role was played well. Not too screamy not to masculine but just right. The camera really likes her in this movie. I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.<br /><br />Anyways this movie deserves a bit more credit than it is given. Please watch the uncut version if you see the MST3K. It deserves that much.',neg
'Cute film about three lively sisters from Switzerland (often seen running about in matching outfits) who want to get their parents back together (seems mom is still carrying the torch for dad) - so they sail off to New York to stop the dad from marrying a blonde gold-digger he calls Precious. Dad hasnt seen his daughters in ten years they (oddly enough) dont seem to mind and think hes wonderful and meanwhile Precious seems to lead a life mainly run by her overbearing mother (Alice Brady) a woman who just wants to see to it her daughter marries a rich man. The sisters get the idea of pushing Precious into the path of a drunken Hungarian count tricking the two gold-digging women into thinking he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think the count is good-looking Ray Milland who goes along with the scheme cause he has a crush on sister Kay.<br /><br />This film is enjoyable light fare. Barbara Read as Kay comes across as sweet and pretty Ray Milland looks oh so young and handsome here (though unfortunately is given little to do) Alice Brady is quite good as the scheming mother - but it is Deanna Durbin a real charmer and cute as a button playing youngest sister Penny who pretty much steals the show. With absolutely beautiful vocals she sings several songs throughout the film though I actually would have liked to have seen them feature her even more in this. The plot in this film is a bit silly but nevertheless I found the film to be entertaining and fun.',pos
'Slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire and of course Timothy Dalton who does a compelling job as always. I wanted to laugh out loud at the voice-overs - so silly!! But Dalton is always worth watching even in bad movies a wonderful actor older now but still very handsome and masculine. This movie is worth viewing only to see him....and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel poor fellow. Your time would be better spent watching Mr. Dalton in 1970s Wuthering Heights or the early 1980s BBC version of Jane Eyre. Poor Sela Ward so lovely but so wooden.... surely shes been better in other movies.',neg
'Jefferson in Paris is a truly confounding film. It presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unflattering light possible painting him as a liar racist and pedophile yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins. This is the way he was the film seems to say. End of sentence end of movie the doors behind you.<br /><br />After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow) Jefferson proceeds to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi) the wife of a homosexual English painter (the criminally underused Simon Callow). A turn of events sends Maria to England however and Jefferson proceeds to forget her with astonishing speed for a man who mere minutes of screen time before was asking her to live with him in America.<br /><br />Hes been bewitched you see by Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton) one of his slaves just arrived from America. Just why hes bewitched is hard to tell--although Sally is undeniably beautiful she acts like a simple-minded child in front of Jefferson. When she isnt telling ghost stories in exaggerated darky speech patterns shes slinking around his bedroom practically oozing lust for her distinguished massa.<br /><br />If her behavior is an attempt to excuse Jeffersons it doesnt work. Jefferson damns himself further when Maria tired of waiting for his letters travels from England to see him. Ive not changed toward you he insists offering weak excuses for not writing. To her credit Maria sees through his brazen lies immediately. When Sally appears and she and Jefferson flirt openly (and cruelly to my mind) in Marias very presence the illusion falls apart completely.<br /><br />No one today believes that Jefferson Washington and the rest were utter paragons of virtue and morality. Yet are we supposed to believe that the learned distinguished Jefferson would be attracted to Sally a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how massas Frenchie friends don unnastan aw corn and who rubs herself against his front as she passes right before Marias eyes?<br /><br />Even if we let that slide its followed by the horrifying revelation that Sally was only 15 when this affair took place (Jefferson was 41). Strangely this fact comes out only toward the very end when Sallys brother James is understandbly furious at her blase announcement that she is carrying Jeffersons child.<br /><br />Jefferson is equally blase when told that Sally is carrying his child and patronizingly tells her that shed be far better off under his protection than free and living in France with her brother. But he promises Ill free her when I die and our children (including any more that come Jefferson says in a chilling declaration of Sally as *his*) when they reach 21. Oh thank you massa you feel like telling the screen. Big deal.<br /><br />The worst scene is still to come however involving Jeffersons daughter Patsy. She is already angry at him first for breaking his vow made to her mother on her deathbed not to marry again. (Obviously the woman wasnt just talking about matrimony.) Jefferson has also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun as she wishes despite earlier moralizing about freedom of religion (that seems to mean freedom to agree with him).<br /><br />Having promised Sally and her brother their freedom Jefferson calls in Patsy to witness the bargain and promise to fulfill it should anything happen to him. Sallys brother blurts out the impending birth of the child and Jefferson asks do you swear? Paltrows performance in this scene is brilliant although she has almost nothing to say. Her face nearly contorts in agonizing pain at this revelation yet she controls her grief and whispers yes.<br /><br />If anything and the filmmakers could have had something if theyd emphasized this point more Jefferson in Paris is an indication of the status of woman in the late 18th century viewed even by men like Jefferson as attractive property pleasing but without true intellect or souls. We see Jefferson shed a few tears over a letter from Maria obviously telling him where to get off but hes soon laughing away at a wild dance from Sally complete with tossed hair and heaving bosom.<br /><br />I dont know whether this is an accurate portrait of Jefferson or not. I dont care to watch it however just for the sake of watching it. This Jefferson is no hero or even an anti-hero. Hes a selfish lying child-molestor--and one who gets away with it--not the kind of man I want to see a movie about.',neg
'For those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline this one is for you! From the bleak New York City atmosphere which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality this movie is a real downer. <br /><br />Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So Hollywood gave theater viewers (for probably the first time) a dose of rape prostitution homosexuality child nudity homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work. <br /><br />It also hoped Im sure to shock mainstream audiences. Well it succeeded on that level. Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time couldnt help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.<br /><br />Forty years ago as a very young man I found this film fascinating too. However seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth I never watched to view it again. <br /><br />The acting was good but so what? Acting is good in many films. Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight couldnt act. Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people. He was kind of like the Johnny Depp of his era playing guys like Ratso Rizzo in this film and then going to be the Rain Man later on. Yes Ratso is a character youll never forget and Joe Buck (Voight) is one you want to forget but the story is so sordid it overwhelms the fine acting.<br /><br />This movie isnt art and it isnt worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and thats why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics. Its two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy religious cheap shots glorifying weirdos (Andy Warhol even gets in the act - no surprise) and generally despicable people.<br /><br />I did like the catchy song Everybodys Talking that helped make Harry Nilsson famous but even that was bogus because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better before Nilsson did it....and few people have ever heard of Neil (which is their loss). And - as mentioned - the name Ratso Rizzo kind of stays with you!<br /><br />The film is a landmark but in a negative sense I fear: this marked it as official that Hollywood had gone down the toilet and it has remained in the sewer ever since.',neg
'My friends and I rented this movie simply to satisfy a friend who was very bent on renting it despite having no idea what it was about. We all thought it would be like a Canadian American Pie but when we watched it we were completely surprised we were all silent throughout the movie and loved it! It was nothing like American Pie and had a plot that teenage girls are sure to adore (seeing as the guy gets the crap beaten out of him at the end) after that night it became my favorite movie for not only its plot but the actors and the great writing. There wasnt a moment where i thought that it was unbelievable. Everything is very realistic and relate-able for anybody living in a small town with little prospects. I absolutely adore this movie and would recommend you to rent it next time you have a chance its worth it.',pos
'...that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not there.<br /><br />Near Dark covered the same territory but with much more class and action.<br /><br />why the script kept their big secret so long was a total mystery to me - I guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film. By the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of big deal tell me something I dont know.<br /><br />I found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror.

'I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and Im dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) captures his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reillys portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanitys struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end? This film reminds us that we are all in that same struggle regardless of class race sex or religion. And who can forget the scene of the suburban homeowner on his hands and knees attacking those few tiny weeds that have dared to appear overnight on his perfectly manicure lawn!',pos
'Polish film maker Walerian Borowczyks La Bête (French 1975 aka The Beast) is among the most controversial and brave films ever made and a very excellent one too. This film tells everything thats generally been hidden and denied about our nature and our sexual nature in particular with the symbolism and silence of its images. The images may look wild perverse sick or exciting but they are all in relation with the lastly mentioned. Sex desire and death are very strong and primary things and dominate all the flesh that has a human soul inside it. They interest and temptate us so powerfully (and by our nature) that they are considered scary unacceptable and something too wild to be true.<br /><br /> A sophisticated young woman travels with her mother to a French countryside to meet her soon-to-become husband whom with she has had a letter affair of some kind. All are very exciting and each others parents and relatives wait impatiently to see the new people arriving to their families. The innocence of the young bride shines through and no one knows what can happen and wake up inside the walls of the big and beautiful French mansion with all its humans and animals and a mysterious la bête that turns out to be something that the characters nor most of the films audience could have never imagined to be real and (in front of) them.<br /><br />The film is about the same theme as Canadian David Cronenbergs debyt feature Shivers (1975) which happens inside a huge luxury building in which destructive and gory parasites spread from human to human by sexual contact and make people act furiously and violently in their lust for pleasure and fulfilment of instincts. Human has instincts that can be and are stronger than his will and that is why those instincts can be as dangerous and powerful as the instincts of some other animal a beast be it a lust for blood revenge or sex and carnal pleasure. Humans are only animals that have intelligence and tools to convey it but because we are also animals that intelligence is not always used too much as can be seen anywhere around us. The film opens greatly and very shockingly for most hypocritic attitudes showing a horny male horse raging in fury as he waits to get inside the mare and continue the race but the rage and visible lust we see from his eyes and violent movements are the key elements of that beginning and why it is there not the close-ups of organs as could be so easily claimed. The horse is a beast that battles in an almost unbearable heat in heat thats much stronger than his will as he doesnt have any control at that point anymore. The power of the instinct makes an animal a beast.<br /><br />After the memorable beginning the characters get introduced and the film fantastically has all the necessary age groups inside it from the little innocent children waiting to grow up and develop to their blossom to the adults and elders that all represent their own part of the lifespan creating the face of human life on screen. A film doesnt necessarily need more characters this way as all the important ones are already there and represent the whole race including the urban and countryside inhabitants and both sexes. The mansion makes the protagonist girls sexuality wake as she saws the horses coupling and acting like she obviously has never thought of. For the first time she sees something unique and something that excites and feels almost vital for her and her body like getting water when youre very thirsty. The transformation of the girl is a very important element in the film as she has lived unaware of these things inside her with his mother and camera and a letter-boyfriend even though the things have just waited for the moment to burst out. Flesh desires flesh and that belongs to being a humanimal but still those things are not so easily admitted everywhere and films like these trying to depict it get banned for decades? Mans stupidity and unwillingness to interpret images must not be an argument for a film being banned or otherwise violated.<br /><br />The films last 30 minutes are also as important as the beginning and once again show how powerful cinema is without needless words and talk. As the girl and audience realizes what her body starts to feel and desire she starts to have dreams about the mysterious beast that turns out to be none other than the undressed form of ourselves having lived in the woods without other people/beasts near him. The dream sequence is the one that causes and caused most of the controversy alongside the films overall straight and honest attitude and the images are so easy to be judged as perverse and pornographic without a courage to go deeper into them character reactions and thoughts behind what we see. The images are exciting in her dream and also eventually inside the dream for the dreams (more) human character and Borowczyk forces us to admit it with the images that are so close to a normal sexual act between a man and a female which is a beautiful thing and expression of love another human need. Also the numerous and cleverly blackly humorous love making scenes inside the mansion between the young mother and the black servant get interrupted many times as someone screams for the servant for example and theres no doubt that the sensual image of two young human bodies being together and being interrupted with an angry shout at least doesnt become any more pleasant by the interruption. Borowczyk has managed to paint his images so beautiful and sensitive that his message is almost impossible to be misunderstood but nothing seems to be impossible for our cultures and minds that criticize art. He uses dialogue only when its necessary otherwise the images do the job and make the film powerful.<br /><br />Death is also there as flesh dies sooner or later after years of life and instincts it dies. The ending is inevitable but the meaning of the dream sequence could have also been as powerful without the kind of dramatic and revealing ending too. Another blackly humorous element comes when we see the shocked city women running out of the place in which they saw a little more than they were looking for! They visited the mansion of truth about flesh us and them. The film reminds me of French writer Georges Batailles Story of the Eye with its same themes about eroticism death and how they both are always connected to the nature of our flesh. The book is well written and fantastic as well as this film and naturally both have been blamed for their too explicit content and other equally noteworthy shallow comments.<br /><br />Borowczyks film is also very beautiful visually alongside its raw honesty and the nature and forest have rarely looked so bright and shining as they do in this film. The sun shines through the trees and to everyplace where humans live and the beauty of it is always there but so is the ugliness that originates by the inhabitants of the world. To every innocent white sheep theres a selfish evil and horrible beast in our world and that is why the intelligence we have been given never fully seems to overcome the power of our bad instincts and the other side of the sheep present inside every human soul. It is about how many manages to keep the dark side passive and not active. The fulfilment of some of our instincts is not a bad thing and by using this intelligence and seeing which of the instincts are good and which bad they can be satisfied without exploitation violence and the lethal and destructive circle created by it. Human is not more than an animal with intelligence intelligence that is so easy to be forgotten and eaten to the background by things that feel better and more satisfying at each and perhaps sudden moment. Borowczyks film is a masterpiece unforgettable and clever piece of magical cinema with ageless theme and also an example of how much can be achieved expressed and given by a film maker who is also only a human.',pos
'Spoilers ahead -- proceed at your own caution.<br /><br />My main problem with this movie is that once Harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers -- with relative ease -- he continues to cave into their demands. And then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped he decides to wire his classic car up to explode (with the money in it) which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic.<br /><br />Okay so he wanted to keep his affair with Cini out of the public eye due to his wifes involvement with the DA campaign. This I can see but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit or even kill them once hed determined there was no actual blackmail evidence (e.g Cinis body?)

Following the horrible scenes was the terrible script filled with pointless and poorly thought out lines. I would never suggest this movie to anyone who would have any sense in watching decent movies. This movie was not only with the same ideas as the show the Bachelor and Bachelorette but also contained many parts in which you would know what the next move and line was going to be without ever having to watched the movie before. The casting was fine but the actors played there characters horribly with more drama then should have been used and said lines in was that wanted you to change the channel quickly.

'Ramin Bahrani sets up a scene early on in Chop Shop that immediately had me identifying with where the character of Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend were coming from. The two of them get on a subway and as soon as the doors close they ask if they could have everyones attention for a moment and that they are selling candy bars or M&Ms or something and then they proceed to sell some bars. If you (as I) have ever been on a subway in New York city at any time this is the kind of situation that happens so often you almost dont notice it. Often the people on a subway will see kids like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something on a subway and not pay them any mind. Bahranis focus isnt necessarily just on kids who hock things for sale on subway rides but on survival and the state of being one is in when in the lower class in America. It is subsequently in his hands thoughtful and heartbreaking usually at once.<br /><br />To compare it to Pixote or the Bicycle Thief isnt too far of a leap (actually in the latter at least the father and son have each other) though Bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style. We care about this character Ali no older than eleven and working in a car shop cleaning some cars and helping take apart others and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him. But its not simply because were force-fed any clichés aside from you know a brother and sister (more-so the brother) trying to take care of one another. Bahrani makes the story accessible through the simple aspiration Ali has the kind of goal that is possible attainable in his situation: saving up enough to buy a used food truck that Ali and Isamar can operate themselves.<br /><br />Its all Ali is working for but what Bahrani shows us in brutal detail is this work what Ali has to do to make it happen even if its distasteful things like ripping hubcaps off of tires from cars in Shea Stadium or at one point stealing a purse in a desperate moment. This makes it all the more serious an issue when Ale sees what his sister does for money on the side at night doing sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road. He doesnt mention it and pushes it aside but its always something that adds to the tension something Ale wants to protect his sister from. It adds to the tragedy when Ale finds out the real cost of what it will take to make the food truck into a profit-maker a cost that just further adds to the anguish that he just internalizes.<br /><br />One could look immediately at the fact that Ale is an orphan in such a neighborhood as the one in the area of Queens the film was shot in- naturally as with a work of neo-neo realism (lets just call it realism) featuring practically all non-professional actors in the parts of the mechanics and workers and people on the streets- but Bahrani is focused more-so on the here and the now and that is what makes Chop Shop so immediate and heartfelt. Not a trace of melodrama is in the film barely even music accompaniment aside from the live Latino music coming from the cars and radios. Sometimes Bahrani will focus on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in further scenes like the way Ale is awake but acts like hes asleep the first night after he witnesses Isamars late-night tryst and we see as she slinks into bed she probably knows hes awake but neither can say a word. Or in a lot of other scenes poetic touches that seem seamless like when the man shows Ale how feeding the pigeons work.<br /><br />Its rough and gritty as you can expect and it doesnt give much hope for its main characters despite the few moments of happiness sprinkled about. Its also a superbly shot hand-held film where the technique as with a lot of movies made in its urban-set tone and approach informs and compliment the subjects on screen and what theyre doing but it also is never recklessly shot or too flashy. The filmmaker has a superb real-life cast (Ale was plucked from a NYC public school without any experience) and knows how to not waste a shot while at the same time achieve a brutal artistry with just showing what he shows. Its not City of God or Pixote; its its own little masterpiece on a character or characters we usually would just not give a second look to (or a first one barely) on our way in a city such as New York. If youre not moved by Ale and his daily struggles I dont know what to do for you.',pos
'This is a sprawling (4 hours) remake of the Rider Haggard story with the usual added female and an extraneous subplot with Russian soldiers seeking a Stone of Power buried along with the treasure of King Solomon. Its very well shot giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of Africa and very well acted. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland who hires Quatermain to help rescue her father. Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of the Russian soldiers (not named in IMDbs listing) are also memorable. For all that Hollywood cant leave a good story alone when they adapt it this one is well told and except that its too long I enjoyed it. 6/10.',pos
'Jakes Closet has the emotional power of Kramer vs. Kramer combined with the imagination of Pans Labyrinth. Even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to Pans Labyrinth. But this is a story that takes place in modern times not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today. Jakes Closet is about a boy an only child practically alone on summer vacation dealing with his family falling apart. Its a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense a horror movie for the thinking person. If youre looking for a slasher movie this wont be your cup of tea but if youre looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting this is the movie for you. At the screening I saw I swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed. I highly recommend catching this film.',pos
'When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do not in the cinemas nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How its possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music its perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!!!<br /><br />Please release this master piece and allow it to have its proper life!!!!!!!!!! This is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance!!!!!! <br /><br />Edvard',pos
'...but memorable because it includes an actor I actually recognize! James Horan is by these types of movies standards Lawrence Olivier. Hes given some decent performances on stuff like Highlander and various Star Treks so its kind of amusing if mildly depressing watching him degrade himself here. Okay yeah theres a plot. Horans character and his wife are fighting hes having an affair with a movie reviewer while trying to do his masterpiece film and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping. But watching Horan is really the only enjoyment to be found here.',neg
'First of all season 1 is intolerably bad. The prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional theyre nearly transparent and the direction is terrible. It runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk. Soon the show gets better but not by much. The return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchair-bound Augustus Hill who is played impressively by Harold Perrineau. The only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with whats taking place in the show.<br /><br />Unfortunately the bad ideas in Oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes. Consider the whole situation first of all. Prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have CD players (CDs?? They might as well pass out steak knives) but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by PRISONERS. Christ the place is like a mens club with guards. Guards that dont do much. <br /><br />Near the end of season two an older prisoners grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of $20 and $50 bills to help send him to Disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish. These have to be the richest prisoners in the world. Every single prisoner in Oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except Kenny Wangler an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing. Even Adibisi wanted to be nice. But thats okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distraction.<br /><br />Later shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an I Love Cops t- shirt. In prison!! Can you imagine?? I have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago. I sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an I Love Cops bumper sticker and one of the woods (guys who have been in prison for years and years) saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds. My cousin got lucky. <br /><br />Kenny Wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him Bricks. One of them even tried to bribe him to go to an English class. You may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards. More than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade. Personally I would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators. <br /><br />Lets see what else? Shillingers son ODs in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs. He just...got them I guess. And make sure to pay attention otherwise youll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums. I didnt know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options. How about this when Robson asks about Dr. Farajs schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given Faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot. Do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners? After Poet and OReilly make the announcement to the entire prison Robson asks to see Dr. Faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word. They might as well give him a gun.<br /><br />I shouldnt go on about stupid ideas in this show but its like a flood I cant stop it. Who thought of the Chinese refugees who cant speak Chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless theyre needed? Who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners? Who though of Robsons gum transplant? Whats the deal with Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agamemnon because he clearly doesnt belong in prison and Busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson. Macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were. <br /><br />But what are the worst ideas? Things that go nowhere which are constant. An Irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb. He threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated. Nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again. Its like it never happened. In one episode prisoners are given dogs to train. What the hell?? If that wasnt bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise. No one seems to mind.<br /><br />I also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they dont say anything and the guards or warden or sister Pete or whoever always says I hope you dont think Im gonna let this go!! And then they walk away and let it go. The audience wont remember. <br /><br />Maybe Im spoiled by Prison Break but Oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play. A short one. At least a low-budget movie. There is just not enough here to sustain a multi-season TV show. Then again I watched six seasons of it on DVD. Sometimes I dont understand myself...',neg
'Well it turned out as I expected: visual overload but nothing else added to the original. What did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick. Initially this awoke my interest but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns (a) were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical Hollywood-like product and (b) made the whole storyline improbable! The 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward and included no time-storms or any bogus of that sort: it just stated that when you come home after a long journey things might have changed a bit. Earth might have fallen in the hands of apes for example. Like many old movies its main ingredient was suspense (hell does anyone understand that word these days?). In this Burton movie an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie but at what cost? Surely the images are overwhelming and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape-culture (even ape-music!) but whats wrong?<br /><br />First the suspension of disbelief is made very hard because the apes have a lot of Hollywood-human traits. I refer especially to Ari and the slave-trader. These traits include emotional skills like irony sarcasm and an overtly displayed array of subtle emotions. It makes you forget that the apes are apes which is essential.<br /><br />Second the humans TALK. Of course we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didnt made the ape/human role-switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version. The wound in the throat that Charlton Heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that Dr. Zira has in him (so no need for things like human rights activists or ape-human love in order to explain things).<br /><br />Third the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility but is a necessary twist in the new movie since Capt. Davidson has to play the Hollywood-lets-save-the-whole-world- and-have-a-good-ending-for-everyone- and-still-make-it-to-the-lounge-bar- for-a-cool-diet-coke character. Oh my god will they never learn? I new it from the start when there was only one guy who got lost! They were in need of a hero! And then the script writers go on reasoning: we need one guy... so why would one guy get lost... because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm... implausible! But its necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes! Since in these modern and politically correct times we cant have a xenophobic ape-hater like Charlton Hestons 68 character loose on the screen: lets give them a bubblegum version!<br /><br />Fourth okay the general twist of the original discovering the truth of the 1968 film to the modern version (he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab-apes developed their society where Heston simply discovered that just somehow the apes overtook the earth while he was away) is nicely done. The second battle-part comes as an anti-climax. Thats because this movie has added the first two Planet Of The Apes movies in one plot. Nice try but the chill you feel when Davidson and you discover that hes lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle-part.<br /><br />Fifth: the ending!!! For chrissakes who came up with that?! (a) Davidson crashes TWICE with his escape pod which seems an unsteerable object while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully? Come on whod believe that? If the pods are really small space crafts (Davidson simply flies off into space at the end) and not merely escape vessels he might have managed a safe landing at least once no? And what about that ending???? I mean in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth. But here: the whole movie takes place on a distant planet and suddenly the same (theres a Thade statue) ape culture is on earth??? How come? Did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically flew into the time storm and colonised earth before Davidsons mission took off? Why is Thade worshiped? Stupid stupid stupid.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape but Id expected no less. I preferred her ape above Estella Warren as a human but maybe I got some loose wire in my head. Nevertheless the only convincing apes were Tim Roth as Thade (wonderful!) and Aris household ape (the ex-general but I forgot his name).<br /><br />Nonono a lot of things could and should have been added/altered to the 1968 pic but not the plot at least not in that way. It was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining. It was nicely tongue-in cheek and caricatured. Dont stylize everything...',neg
'I collect films on Super-8 and managed to snag a full length print of this one last week on E-bay. It looks like at least for the moment this is the only way to see this film in a country having NTSC video. I have seen it available on Region 2 DVD many times but never Region 1. <br /><br />I just finished watching it a few minutes ago and I am amazed by it. Its a powerful testament to freedom and finding your own place in the world.

'Roy Rogers stars as Jesse James and his look-alike gambler man Clint Burns. George Gabby Hayes is Mr. Rogerss ex-pal Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a noteworthy team as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero.<br /><br />Of course mistaken identity / impersonation is a plot development since Rogers essays a dual role. Rogers is charming as usual; but there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll/Hyde performance is done in by poor material. The better pair to watch are Ms. Storm and Ms. Paye as the St. Louis Journal reporters - they are the films highlight. The songs are fine though badly synched. <br /><br />*** Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers George Gabby Hayes Gale Storm',neg
'Offbeat slow-paced entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and blasphemous scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However itll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains or to ignore Krabbes first-rate performance. Verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film playing with the meaning of the heros visions-omens. Unfortunately in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur and the unsatisfying ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie. (***)',pos
'I thought that this movies was a letdown I expected it to be so much better than it was. I am so glad I didnt pay to see this movie and that I didnt sit in a movie theater for this one. Where to begin on this movie the acting in this movie was average the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasnt special. I thought that this movie was suppose to be great but it wasnt more than a cheesy waste of time. I think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry it just wasnt there. I think that if maybe we had a different actor play Kirk than Jay Baruchel it might have been better but the entire time I watched this movie he looked high and I didnt get the feeling that he wasnt acting in this movie. Now Alice Eve did a great job as an actress but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie. The humor in this movie was not funny at all there were a few one liners in this movie that were OK but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand. I think that Jim Field Smith had a hard time with this because he couldnt decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. I honestly think he needs to stick with the Burger King commercials. I think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director. The storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just OK guy love storyboring I think that it would have been better if it had more originality but what a letdown nothing. I honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie. I think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie. So save yourself the agony and just dont see it.',neg
'I remember watching the BSG pilot. I can describe that night exactly. I remember what chair I sat in. That show was magic. It came alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed parts of the third year even and I watched every episode of the fourth year totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around. Well it didnt.<br /><br />I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching the regular episodes and they are getting more and more boring.<br /><br />Its too obvious too predictable. It reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last failed show Virtuality.<br /><br />Much of his line work on DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way it was good. This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series. When they departed from that after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus it all went to pot. It was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going.<br /><br />Maybe it will improve. Maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes. But I am very very nervous.',neg
'I went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession. I just wanted to check it out. I was not expecting much of anything. After all a musician an actor and a screenplay writer? Not possible for so much talent to reside in one person. Right?? <br /><br />Wrong!! Obsession aside it quickly became one of my favorites! The story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up Hollywood special effects. The story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along. As the credits roll by you suddenly realize you were glued until the end.<br /><br />At times the acting seems a little over the top. I do however believe its done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character. Otherwise I wouldnt have expected the level of acting witnessed.<br /><br />Its worth seeing more than once. I find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something I either missed or forgot about the first time or two around.<br /><br />I completely recommend this movie. Feel free to go in with your doubts but Im sure it will find a place on your shelf.',pos
'Skip all the subjective this is a great film reviews and read the IMDB trailer or the back the KINO videobox (which includes both versions of this flick) which Ill paraphrase: To the tune of sci-fi score by George Antheil the camera goes on a sleepwalk through B-Movie hell all photographed by Will Thompson (who did Plan 9 from outer space & Maniac). You dont know whether to laugh AT the film or WITH it. So if you like self-produced B or C-grade noir-wannabe actors and effects with pretensions of surrealism this could be for you! Otherwise get a copy of Screamplay a modern low-budget expressionist masterpiece.',neg
'Though I did not begin to read the Classics in literature until I was 47 its never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons mainly because there isnt a part of the book I liked less only parts I enjoyed more. The 1983 TV mini-series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I hoped it would be. I saw it as a full length movie in 2006. Daltons Mr. Rochester was very good but I absolutely loved Zelahs Jane Eyre. Relecting on another Classics movie I saw recently I was disappointed in the production direction and dialogue. It was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of Hollywood. Artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism. Using the title after such license is fraud. Leave it to the Brits to get this one right (among others). You wont be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with its proper context and spirit. Well done BBC.',pos
'Seriously this film is not. Steve Guttenburg is constantly forcing his tough-guy dialogue and then giving everyone the evil-eye all the time. He just wasnt believable he seems like hes trying to be a badass and he sucks at it. I just remember him as the millionaire dad with the Olsen twins in It Takes Two...so this is a BIG change. I rented this film for Sean Bean and he dies (as usual). Only this time he didnt get impaled on a boat anchor (Patriot Games) smashed by a giant satellite dish (Goldeneye) or get run over by cows(The Field). He just got shot real quick-like and civil and that was all I got from this film that they didnt kill him off in an extremely grotesque and morbid way. How sad is that? I was only watching it for the 3 seconds that Sean was in it and then the rest was rubbish. I actually tried to watch and understand the plot but there really wasnt one. Seemed a little like Mission Impossible with the holeOooooo! Theres a mole! Its the leader of the group and NO ONE EXPECTED IT! Lets trap him! Lets frame the underdog good-guy so we can get away with it! Cliched and tired this movie was a waste of time.',neg
'Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through but how well was the emotional stuff handled? It would have been so easy to descend into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off. The image of the ex female cyberman making crying noises as she/it saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. Thats twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetically the previous being the last Dalek from series one but by Jove its worked. Add to that the other ex-female who had been upgraded on the eve of her wedding and Jackie Tyler recognising her husband after she had become cyber and you have a permanent throat lump.

'I dont know how to describe this movie. Its definitely one of the weirdest movies Ive seen in a long time. It is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places. The scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone whos into gore & splatter. I found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes. The clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and The Dentist is therefore quite unsettling.<br /><br />The humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if youre a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking for.<br /><br />If you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment give it a try!<br /><br />My rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)',neg
'I am 17 and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade Scooby Doo and the Goblin King which I wasnt expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes expecting something very good but from what I saw of it I wasnt impressed at all. First of all I hated the animation. It was flat deflated and very Saturday- morning -cartoon -standard easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hate had slightly better animation. Even worse Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens and I really missed Fred Velma and Daphne as they added a lot to the old episodes when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also hated the character changes because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero something they wouldve never had done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune wasnt very good either I cant even remember it and the jokes were lame and contrived. Though I do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast had they had better material and hadnt been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible which they did might I add. In conclusion I personally thought it was awful and I am not trying to discredit it its what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox',neg
'Now I flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you watch a car crash...<br /><br />I appreciate the fact its a spoof but that should not stop me from criticising the god-awful directing acting and dialogue. Seriously this rated as one of the poorest movies I have seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper and a poor one at that...<br /><br />Okay - a few criticisms (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attack him so we assume its a heart attack) the army then launch shells rockets bullets at the monster - which was feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive (2) the army attack from about 100 yards away and we see a flame-thrower being used - geez those things have a range of no more than 30 metres! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling; the monster drops the kid and the soldiers dont try to shoot the monster??? come on! (4) the monster looks like it something out of Power Rangers! (5) there is one scene where the five good guys (the priest the girl the doctor the reporter and the kid) all look shocked and we get reactions (along the lines of hand to mouth) one after the other - so natural! (6) the general just runs away time after time (7) the general refuses to try electricity and wouldnt listen (8) the acting is awful (9) did I mention the rubber suit monster???? (10) that god-awful music non-stop!',neg
'Despite much style flash and glitter this French musical fails to speak. The tunes are repetitive predictable and tedious. The story is uninteresting as are the many characters. <br /><br />People break into song and dance without motivation or reason.

'This Belgian film directed by Tom Barman singer of the well-known group dEUS will not be favoured by everyone. For the simple reason that there isnt a clear story or even a plot.

'I cant believe that someone actually paid to have this film made. Stupid unrealistic and stereotypical. Right from the take off of the massive 747 the pilot pulled the throttles back to increase speed. then you have 5 armed persons with semi to fully automatic weapons firing without so much as one bullet breaching the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38000 feet. Then once below in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a FUEL line and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane. The acting was just horrid and forced. There just didnt seem to be any direction. I have seen some pretty horrid B movies in my lifetime but with the names that were in this film I was extremely disappointed.',neg
'I cant quite explain why I find this so alluring and The Leopard not; it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film those intimate moments that Visconti can render so magnificently. Like that film it has a majestically slow pace but this time it isnt overlong. Its the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that. I think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story. Like The Leopard it has a sympathetic lead who brings out the same kind of worn pathos -- though Bogards performance is more willing to open itself to being unlikable especially in look: he has a really stupid grin thats easy to dislike. Its often quite beautiful in the quiet moments. Its the opulence of Viscontis films the grandeur of the ball scenes that I find tedious as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision. But here that is part of the point -- Gustav surrounded by a visual din.<br /><br />The way in which the object of Gustavs affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant -- the camera shows a girl girl girl then this beautiful feminine-featured boy. Its like an allusion to Shakespeares sonnets and it doesnt feel heavy-handed. (Its not until the camera views Tadzio fully pulls back and we see his long slender legs that we realize he is not a boy but an adolescent -- at first were forced to question Gustavs attraction in an uncomfortable way; Visconti must have known that and he doesnt shy away from it.) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav; we get a sense of the man we know him. Its a largely silent performance and when he does open his mouth its to spew venom; no wonder he wants the angelic open-featured boy to project himself onto. Theres a difference with Tadzio (we never know him just as we never know a handful of Fellini grotesques; but thats because his life is another its own film) but its not as flirtatious as its been made to seem (there is one scene however where he twirls around a pole thats too much). Tadzio isnt necessarily leading him on -- hes looking at him; Visconti just zooms in is all.<br /><br />The film doesnt detail Gustav as being gay -- Tadzio isnt even really male hes a prettified version of a boy (delicate pale wispy with golden locks) that everyone seems to love (including one gorgeous slightly older young man who he wrestles with). The closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to Gustavs homosexuality is the famous barber scene which unlocks his repressed vanity.<br /><br />It isnt totally successful -- the whole section with Alfred is a waste and some unnecessary scenes people carrying bags in long shot could have been excised. Some parts are heavy-handed such as when Gustavs boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass him by -- the looks on his face are too obvious. (But during the same scene Gustav throws a fit wanting a new rower something so unexplainable that it makes up for it.) But there are some scenes -- touching for the first time -- that build up a remarkable quiet intensity. Tadzio repeating a piano song again and again the notes quivering in the air may be the best example of the anxiety the film has. There is one discussion that contains a debate Im especially interested: Can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses or does it have to go beyond them? (We can consider Tarkovsky who esteems both Visconti and Mann to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory sensations.) I think this one manages to do both. 9/10',pos
'If you have any kind of heart and compassion for people this is a tough movie to watch at least in the second half of it. <br /><br />Its in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded (mentally- challenged) man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child. Its not pleasant material.<br /><br />However its a good movie and the acting is good too. The story will sit with you awhile.<br /><br />Dominick is the mentally-disabled guy and is played by Tom Hulce. I think this might be Hulces best role ever. Hes looked after by a med student Eugene played by Ray Liotta who became a star the following year with Kevin Costners Field Of Dreams.<br /><br />Dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads Hulk comic books and loves wrestling. Hes the type of slow guy that you cant help but love and root for to live a happy life. When he freaks out its for several good reasons and...well see the film for the whole story. Its worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see.',pos
'I saw this a couple of nights back not expecting too much and unsurprisingly it didnt deliver anything too exciting. The plot set up of a crew of vampire hunters (V-San for vampire sanitation) going around in their spaceship periodically killing space vamps and rescuing people is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite ace. Unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film leaving something behind that though vacantly watchable is quite laughably bad. I dont expect anything too special from these films that pop up on the Sci Fi Channel and at least this wasnt one of their creature features with an atrocious cgi beast shambling about but it was still pretty bad mostly due to the writing and acting but with a sterling contribution to the overall badness made by the horrible music. When the film opted just for a typical science fiction sounding weird noises approach to the soundtrack it did OK but all too often hilariously bad soft rock intruded and pitched scenes into silliness. I would have tolerated the general cheesy acting and writing more were it not for the choice of music which was a serious miscalculation turning things from cheesy to lamely comical. Of the acting Dominic Zamprogna was OK but bland as the nominal hero whilst Leanne Adachi was pretty irritating as the tough girl of the vamp busting team and Aaron Pearl played another member who wasnt well written or interesting enough to make an impression. Though she didnt seem that good at the acting lark Natassia Malte did well through having a less irritating character than the others and the fact that she is seriously nice to look at. The only serious name in the cast is Michael Ironside and he is underused though he does nicely pretty amusing in a manner one suspects was intentional. He seems to have fun and earn his paycheck and his role is entertaining. The effects are OK on the whole they are at least of the standards of the average science fiction TV show and there are also a few scenes of blood splatter and a bit of fun gore as well. Things move along nicely and I almost feel harsh rating this film badly but then I remember bursting into laughter at regular intervals and realising that unless the film is an intentional comedy which I dont think it is then it simply doesnt succeed. Too much is lame daft unconvincing its an OK effort I guess but it didnt appeal to me. Only give it a go if you really dig Sci Fi trash or unintended chuckles Id say.',neg
'This is a fabulous film.<br /><br /> The plot is a good yarn and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view. What was deliberate and what was coincidence? Who is in love with who?<br /><br /> You get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn (sometimes literally) and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth.<br /><br /> With a bit of effort following the twists and turns you can understand each of the characters; and key events in the film are reshot from the point of view of different people.<br /><br /> Take the opportunity if it comes again to your arthouse cinema; it looks good on the big screen.<br /><br /> More than keeping you guessing the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds - I defy anyone to predict!<br /><br /> But more likely you will need more than one viewing - I saw this at the pictures on its original release three times and it got better each time.<br /><br /> The acting was very good with a standout performance by Romane Bohringer as Alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble.<br /><br /> A classic. The second-best film of the 1990s.',pos
'While there is a lot to recommend about Maetel Legend both in concept and finished product its ultimately a poor film. Plot wise its a retelling of Maetels early life which is usually unclear; at the same time the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the Machine Empire. And since Leiji Matsumoto has trouble not including his other work we get a starting point for Emeraldas her sister Her mother: the Queen of La Metalle and a bit of Galaxy Express 999 to flesh out the film.<br /><br />In short Maetel is a princess on the planet La Metalle a planet with an irregular orbit thus meaning its cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and its artificial Sun is dying. The Planet grows increasingly colder throughout the story thus increasing the sense of doom. In order to protect her subjects and family the Queen decides that mechanisation is the only way to ensure survival of La Metalles people. Enter Lord Hardgear a robot / cyborg who provides the means for the job. Through the film the characters are left to question mechanisation will they still be human? Can Hardgear be trusted? Do souls and hearts remain? So for a fan of Matsumotos work theres lots to enjoy questions to be answered themes continued except its obvious that the film is meant to be an introduction as well as a fan curiosity. The negatives foremost the animation while Galaxy Express 999 a TV series from over 20 years ago has shoddy mouth animation and at times sketchy character design Maetel Legend has all the worst traits of modern animation and thus earns an air of respectability to Galaxy Express 999. The design is well detailed but unfortunately the animation has suffered leaving well drawn characters that slide as in the backgrounds move or the camera zooms a quick way of animating. However the few yes few well animated scenes are re used over and over in dream sequences repetition and in extra scenes. Anyone whos seem the film will wonder how many times Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine.<br /><br />Next the story While in concept everything sounds great the finished product is in fact a series of conversations of plot which are repeated over and over to little effect the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and the characters which are seemingly much more articulate in former incarnations. Add to all of that some terrible character design that seem lifeless over exaggerated and the audience is left with a movie so miss handled it might as well have been rewritten as a different film at least the newcomers wouldnt be left baffled.<br /><br />And yet it really has its moments the ending at least is surprising. The plight of the citizens of La Metalle was quite affecting and rightly disturbing; I guess I find that whole man-machine theme distressing. Its hard know who to recommend Maetel Legend to since its not well animated written or executed plus confusing once Leiji Matsumotos mandatory cross-referencing is introduced. However I cant help but brighten up when the magnificent entrance of Three-Nine occurs now thats good cinema.<br /><br />1/5 stars out of 5 2 if youre a fan.',neg
'First the current IMDb plot description seems to be misleading the movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic hitchhiker who plans to kill them all. They stop at a small motel where he holds them hostage but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. Violence ensues.<br /><br />I picked this up by mistake thinking it was the other 2007 movie The Hitcher. Not that The Hitcher is any better and I was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway but this was almost unbearable at times. I think I could have vomited on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this.<br /><br />I cant even count how many movies Ive seen with virtually the same storyline so this was almost painfully predictable at times but what really made it awful were a few scenes that ... well let me give an example. At one point a door is covered in (what is very obviously) blood and two police officers at the scene because of a 911 call are looking at it from 30 feet away see a man also covered in blood walk out of the door agree that it looks suspicious but decide to not investigate further.<br /><br />But however ridiculous it may be the movie was never boring was well produced directed and acted complete with good special effects gratuitous nudity and violence. I probably would not recommend actually spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie but it turned out to be perfect to have on while I cleaned my basement. Also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan on doing more talking than watching.',neg

'*Could contain spoilers read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: did we miss it again? So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.<br /><br />So basically its an Island in a magnetic shield. All of it is fake. All the signs are there. Fake beards fake doors fake medicine fake observations stations with fake air shafts that lead to nothing. Its a project indeed and because of the final scene in the season 2 finale I know it has to do something with Desmond his chick and her dad (and probably Libby shes weird maybe she actually has something to do with the plane crashing OK now im drifting off).<br /><br />Also in this episode Henry Gail tells Michael to go to some coordinates and hell find rescue their. This is probably some sort of door in the magnetic shield. once youre gone. there is no way back.<br /><br />I think its pretty obvious despite of the numerous questions I still have and hope to get answers for in the next season. If you think back on what weve learned in season 1 and 2 Im sure well get loads of answers in season 3.<br /><br />Cant wait.<br /><br />Can anyone agree on this theory? Hope to hear from you...',pos
'This is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like The Corporation and Fahrenheit 9/11.

'When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes and his contractual arrangement with David O. Selznick ended because of this. Actually he made some really good films in the period such as NOTORIOUS SPELLBOUND UNDER CAPRICORN ROPE and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked the audiences were turned off by Hitchs attempts at experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public (making ignore the merits of that film) and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked - far more disliked then it deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of its star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem to be a failure (which it wasnt). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in its favor.<br /><br />With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films. Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith the story was of how Guy Haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and fawning and Guy views him as one of the typical fans he has met...if a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows all about Guys personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and is in love with Anne Morton daughter of a Senator. Bruno knows that Miriam wont divorce her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather who is constantly criticizing him. Then Bruno mentions (sort of off the cuff) an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees it is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guys destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just does not realize that the eccentric Bruno is a sociopath and believes Guy has just agreed to the two killing each others foe!<br /><br />Its a wonderfully simple plot actually. Bruno of course does kill Miriam but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified - and worse he finds that he is the police departments number one suspect. When Bruno to encourage Guy mentions he has the latters lighter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site Guy finds himself in deeper problems - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) the insane Bruno?<br /><br />Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other. There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each others orbits. It is like fate drawing them together. Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch with a typical twist makes the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure. His scheme may be vicious (it will kill two people if successful and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what) but he has a zest for life. One suspects that once Guy too had one but his marriages failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more circumspect and dull than he was.<br /><br />The cast is good too. Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this film (only a year before his death). It was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK. His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam - enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses) so that they actually are cheering Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman) who bears a close resemblance to Miriam and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman is properly supportive of Granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed. Other supporting performers Leo G. Caroll as the Senator Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Brunos dotty mother and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are all shown to best advantage - all at the hand of a master.',pos
'There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And WHY DO THEY MAKE MOVIES THIS BAD??? The premise is absurd. Thre acting is one dimensional. The special effects are overdone. And the movie is one unending gun battle among some of the lousiest shots Hollywood ever produced. But then if they had been good shots everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Too bad it didnt happen that way. Tempted to turn it off several times I stuck with it to see just how bad it could get. Glad I did because (SPOILER?) the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey dismal scenario.It is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive-in in off season. Apart from the general awfulness of the film I worry deeply about its impact on young audiences. The Americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is truly banal cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale!',neg

'In the autobiographical coming-of-age tale Romulus My Father Eric Bana of Munich fame plays an impoverished German émigré struggling to raise his son Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee) in rural 1960s Australia. The major obstacle to the familys stability and happiness is his wife Christina (Franka Potente) who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men. Despite her highly unconventional behavior Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him. It is unfortunately the good-hearted and good-natured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie (Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be an author).<br /><br />Even though I admire Romulus My Father for what it is trying to do I cant honestly say I enjoyed it for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it these simply arent enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen. A serious slice-of-life drama is one thing but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery insanity and multiple suicides (let alone attempted suicides) is something else again.',neg

'This film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. Its exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. However what I found hard to take about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. Come on sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults. Another thing I found odd was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the film well not a proper one at least.',neg

'Excellent pre-code amoral tale with Barbara Stanwyck as the newly inspired (by writings of Nietzsche!) to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself use men to her advantage. Not really fair on the German philosopher but interesting that this was the year Hitler came to power. Stanwyck even in this young version doesnt do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here ever driving herself and the film forward. Not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risqué situations and astonishing quips and innuendo. Great fun if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and I suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female. Still thats life!',pos

'Surely no Saturday morning TV kids show was ever done this poorly. After all those producers had to count on the audience coming back. Well in this awful offering they could at least count the money they saved on sets. The script could have been a reject from some long-forgotten space opera serial with a few smarmy lines added for cool-dude Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline so the action just plods boringly along. The spaceship props are absurd--a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter for example--but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history. Most are crude drawings and its all bathed in an often misfocused red light. Even Mohrs bare hairy chest is used as a prop. And its a bad one--as rib-thin as the plot. Any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians--and will probably agree completely!',neg
'I think that this movie is actually entertaining although it lacks some features essential for this kinda films. First of all when Doug and Chappy start their mission they take off with F-16B and during the combat scenes they are piloting F-16A. The second thing I dislike of this film is the ever-repeating F-16 rolling to its right to escape from missiles...why chaff and flares havent been shown in any movie yet? Third of all once you see the F-16 almost empty of ammo it appears again plenty of missiles... the models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft aint good either. However I think that using IAI Kfir as opponent planes was really good far better than the F-5 shown in Top Gun (but this movie isnt as good as that masterpiece).<br /><br />A funny movie I love planes and Ive seen it more than 3 times.',pos
'This film has got to be ranked as one of the most disturbing and arresting films in years. It is one of the few films perhaps the only one that actually gave me shivers: not even Pasolini´s Sálo to which this film bears comparison affected me like that. I saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like Pasolini Fassbinder and others. I had to ask myself what was it about the film that made me feel like I did? I think the answer would be that I was watching a horror film but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre. Typically in a horror film horrible and frightening things will happen but on the margins of civilized society: abandoned houses deserted hotels castles churchyards morgues etc. This handling of the subject in horror is I think a sort of defence mechanism a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desires and fears of the viewer. So from this perspective Hundstage is not a horror film; it takes place in a perfectly normal society and so doesn´t dabble in the histrionics of the horror film. But what you see is the displacement of certain key thematics from the horror genre especially concerning the body and its violation the stages of fright and torture it can be put through. What Seidl does is to use the settings of an everyday middle class society as a stage on which is relayed a repetitious play of sexual aggression loneliness lack and violation of intimacy and integrity: precisely the themes you would find in horror but subjected to a principle of light and transparency from which there is no escape. It is precisely within this displacement that the power of Seidl´s film resides. Hundstage deals with these matters as a function of the everyday displays them in quotidian repetition rather than as sites of extremity and catharsis - a move you would encounter in said horror genre. One important point of reference here is Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Fassbinder also had a way of blending the political with the personal in his films a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism domination desire questions concerning ownership sexual property and control fascism and capitalism etc. Seidl´s tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with Fassbinder; like this German ally he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films. During a seminar at the Gothenburg Film Festival this year at which Seidl was a guest he was asked why he would have so many instances of violated subjugated women in Hundstage but no instances of a woman fighting back liberating herself. Seidl replied that some may view it as immoral to show violence against women but that he himself felt it would be immoral not to show it. An artistic statement as good as any I think. Thank you.',pos

Walking into the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck Larry happens upon barman Mike who unbeknown to Larry is about to change his life for ever.......<br /><br />The alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing stretching back to the likes of Its A Wonderful Life and showing no signs of abating with the quite recent Sandler vehicle that was Click. Its a genre that has produced very mixed results. Back in 1990 was this James Belushi led production rarely mentioned when the said topic arises it appears that it has largely been forgotten. Which is a shame since it oozes charm and is not short in the humour department. We know that we are being led to its ultimate message come the end but its a fun and enjoyable path to be led down. The film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor James Belushi was.

'Ruthless evil warlord Samanosuke (superbly played to the hateful hilt by Yutaro Gomi) cruelly mistreats the peaceful residents of a small village. The giant stone statue Majin eventually comes to life to destroy Samanosuke and his wicked minions. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient age-old legendary folktale: theres a very strong sense of an ancient time and faraway remote place (its specifically set in feudal Japan) the good guys are noble and appealing while the villains are truly nasty and detestable the occasional stirring swordfights are staged with considerable skill and gusto the special effects are fine and impressive the serious tone and steady pace never falter for a minute and Majins last reel rampage of savage destruction is extremely lively exciting and more than a little scary. Moreover the fantastic elements of the narrative are given substantial credibility by being firmly grounded in a throughly believable dark harsh and gritty world. This film earns bonus points for depicting Majin as more of a brutal and frightening force of angry vengeance instead of a pure spirit of absolute good. Veteran composer Akira Ifukube supplies a typically rich robust and rousing score. Fujio Moritas sharp moody cinematography likewise hits the bulls eye. The capable cast all give admirably sound and sincere performances with especially praiseworthy work by Jun Fujimaki as the valiant protective Kogenta and Tatsuo Endo as mean henchman Gunjuro.

'Gespenster (2005) forms together with Yella (2007) and Jerichow (2008) the Gespenster-trilogy of director Christian Petzold doubtless one of the creme-De-la-creme German movie directors of our time.<br /><br />Roughly Gespenster tells the story of a French woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in Berlin - and has never been seen ever. Since then the mother keeps traveling to Berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of time-dilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age. As we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter Marie. However this time when she meets Nina everything comes quite different.<br /><br />The movie does not bring solutions not even part-solutions and insofar it is rather disappointing. We are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not. Most disappointing is the end. After what we have witnessed in the movie it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves Nina alone. The simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy (f.ex. in Umberto D.) but in Gespenster it is displaced.<br /><br />Since critics have been suggesting Freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt: Why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows? This is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of Aristotelian logic according to which the notion of the individual holds. The individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else. So the Aristotelian answer to my question is: They do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change. Everybody who is not insane believes that. However what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change e.g. scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark under their right shoulder-blade? This is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made although I am not sure whether even the director has realized that. Despite our modern Aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational-ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of Gespenster of the most interesting kind.',pos

'I think it was François Truffaut who said that the best movies either involve the joy of making movies or the agony of making movies. This flick is definitely of the first type. Tromeo and Juliet is a pleasure to watch from start to finish. The zany zeal fuelling this Shakespearian shenanigan is infective. I dont think Ive laughed so hard since I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Its that good!',pos
'This was the very first kung fu movie that I have ever seen. The dubbing is not the greatest but alot better than some that I had seen. The plot is much better than some that are made today. It is gory at times but that is what gives it that special push. Academy award material is it not. But if you like to watch fights and a decent story backround this is for you!',pos
'Being an admitted chess addict I was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between Garry Kasparov and IBMs Deep Blue supercomputer. I was hoping to see an in depth look at the match and a lot of what Kasparov had to say. Boy was I wrong and misguided by a mile. This documentary is a lot like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash but no real substance. After watching it I am sad to say I felt like I wasted my time. One of the most annoying aspects about the documentary is that it does not stay at one place for a decent period of time. It has the typical MTV type editing where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds. It is very sad that film-making has been watered down to the attention span of a 10-year old child.<br /><br />I understand it is difficult to make a film about chess but that does not mean one should make it flashy. Game Over did have a couple of interesting ideas though. It brought up the idea whether computers can think like human beings or not; whether computers have advanced to a unique new level. This is what Kasparov thought after the match but this film does not go deep enough with this idea. Also this film tries to bring in a bizarre theory. It tries to imply the paranoid that a human being was making the moves along with the help of the computer. Kasparov had suspicions about this but still to this day there is no evidence. Towards the end of the film it tries to imply the bizarre that maybe Anatoly Karpov might have been the human being who was secretly making the moves with the aid of Deep Blue. Interesting to think about but I dont know how plausible or realistic it is. I still would not recommend this movie though not even for chess addicts.',neg
'I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie....except when the bras and bullets started flying. I have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyone....but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep. I recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics. Also try Fritz the cat and the NINE Lives of Fritz the Cat. If Im correct Ralph Bashki did that movie too.It involves a cat that goes through hard times with family streetsjobs  etc. When I was old enough I rented all of these movies out. Because Coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also made Cool World starring a very young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man.',pos
'The trouble with the book Memoirs of a Geisha is that it had Japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an American mans way of thinking. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music sets and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from Japanese ways of thinking were the characters.<br /><br />The movie isnt about Japan or real geisha. It is a story about a few American mens mistaken ideas about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is this movie if it isnt about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes but then why make it into an American fantasy?<br /><br />There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang-ups no connotations of sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. <br /><br />Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? Nope. One character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesnt want to get caught doing something dirty. Such typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha.<br /><br />Did Sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? Nope. She lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. Of course she isnt supposed to enjoy it. And that is what I mean about this movie. Why couldnt they have given her something to enjoy? Why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?<br /><br />Behind Mameha the Chairman was Sayuris secret patron and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. He could have rigged the auction and won her himself. Nobu didnt even bid. So why did the Chairman let that old codger win her and reeking of old-man stink get his fingers all over her naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for that?<br /><br />Lets try to make sense of this. By being behind Mameha the Chairman incurred debts for Sayuris geisha training. In order to recoup his debts the Chairman had Sayuri sold to Dr. Crab. Through Mameha the Chairman sold Sayuris sexual favors to that old geezer so that the Chairman could make some money out of her. The Chairman wasnt her patron. He was her pimp! Some romantic love story.<br /><br />Yes the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive alluring transvestite whose voice appearance and every touch are thrilling. But under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. Under the incorrectly appearing Japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart soul spirit and core of this film is entirely American and male. Not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie distortion and terribly wrong.<br /><br />Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG:<br /><br />Japanese style  Refined elegant simplicity. MOAG style  Peking Opera.<br /><br />Japanese geisha  Hair swept up. MOAG geisha  Loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup.<br /><br />Japanese shaved ice - Japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances. Shaved ice is strictly a summer treat. MOAG shaved ice - The Chairman buys Chiyo the young Sayuri played by the marvelous Suzuka Ohgo this treat during cherry-blossom-viewing season. The thought made my entire body shiver with cold.<br /><br />Japanese geisha  Trained and skilled entertainers. MOAG geisha - sluts.<br /><br />Japanese wind chime - Used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes thanks to the breeze Japanese people feel somehow cooler. MOAG wind chime - a door bell! If a person stood in front of anothers house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic not gain entrance.<br /><br />Japan  Emphasis on human relationships group oriented. MOAG  I want a life thats mine American individualism.<br /><br />Japanese traditional dance  Refined elegance. An almost geometrical and mechanical precision. MOAG dance  Martha Graham freaking out on LSD while wearing a not-very-auspicious white Japanese funeral shroud. Performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha?<br /><br />Japan house fire  Setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community. Fires can rip through those wooden villages towns and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people. MOAG house fire - Great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out-of-control fire miraculously puts itself out. Technically the movie ended here because at the very least Sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again. Which is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled.<br /><br />Enough. The movie stinks.',neg
'The Human Tornado is a campy 70s Blaxploitation movie starring nightclub comedian Rudy Ray Moore in perhaps his most endearing role to date. The movie tells the tale of Dolemite a bad ass pimpin hustler who gets on the wrong side of a white racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife. Dolemite barely escapes and journeys to sunny California to visit an old friend a nightclub owner (and Madam to Dolemites ladies) named Queen Bee. However it seems that a rival nightclub owner with Mob connections is trying to muscle in on her racket so Dolemite takes matters into his own hands. Rudy Ray Moore showcases many diverse talents in this landmark film including strong dramatic skills a mastery of Kung Fu an impressive singing voice (he provides two of the songs on the soundtrack) a touching compassionate side with the ladies and an overall compelling charisma and keen sense of comic timing. This film has it all people: A deep plot blistering action laugh-a-minute comedy beautiful women in distress a slam-bang ending...what more could you ask from a movie? Run dont walk to your local video store and rent The Human Tornado today. And be sure to share it with your family.',pos
'Most of the other posts beat this movie up and deservedly so. Ive just got to chime in on the technical ineptness of the film makers. It would have been nice if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a gun was because he had no clue.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! <br /><br />Stupidity: <br /><br />Spec Ops team assembled from various military units whose members have never met each other before.<br /><br />Maybe two people in the unit had weapons that used the same magazines parts ammo etc.<br /><br />The sniper school instructor uses a sub machine gun (pistol caliber) as opposed to a rifle which we would assume she would be more proficient with.<br /><br />One poor team members night vision optics weigh more than the rifle does. You can tell when he handles it that it is SERIOUSLY top heavy.<br /><br />The team leader sends out a team member to challenge the Skeleton Man when they first confront him. Challenge a 200 year old reanimated Native American skeleton with a long spear and an attitude riding an undead war horse with a severe nosebleed? I think not Bubba.<br /><br />Bullets do not spark when they hit trees Mr. Director. (a couple of people have already mentioned this.) <br /><br />The teams air support consists of a ubiquitous black helicopter only this one has a couple of sidewinder missiles slung underneath. Someone forgot to tell the helo crew that the Skeleton Man doesnt fly and they are over the American heartland where there wont be any enemy aircraft. They should have carried some air to ground missiles instead.<br /><br />The helos air to ground ordnance consists of a door gunner with a semi-auto AK-47(or 74?). Needless to say he only hits dirt. Should have brought a belt fed light machine gun.<br /><br />Door gunner later finds out that a grenade launcher is pretty useless as well.<br /><br />A wooden arrow from a freaking recurve bow does not down helicopters Mr. Director.<br /><br />I pretty well could not take anymore after this point (about 30 minutes) and gave up. You seriously need a morphine drip to make it through this flick it is just that painful.',neg
'I cant really remember any details of this movie except that the setting looked awfully familiar. Then I realized it was filmed at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab Utah. That was one of my favorite places to visit when I was younger and wandered around the country. The guy who owns/manages the hostel managed to get himself in the movie. All I remember about the plot of the movie is that it involves jeeps and naked women. It is great to watch just for the scenery (I mean the rock formations)... If you are just looking for soft-core porn you will probably be better served elsewhere. I dont even know if this movie is available on tape or DVD.',neg
'The special effects of this movie are especially for its time laughable and used in such an over-emphasized way that you cant deny their terrible existance.<br /><br />The acting redefines the term terrible overacting at the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul where julie Newman and Andrew Divoff just redefine bad.<br /><br />***spoilers***<br /><br />The charm in this movie can be found in two things: First is the excellent casting of Carel Lurch Struycken as the mysterious psychic Gaunt who can sense where and when people will die and is always there.<br /><br />The second are original finds the combination SF-Western is obviously original if terrible but other finds are more original like the gunman Zack Stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots (though his acting falls short here).<br /><br />Overal...dont see this movie except if you love that ol hunk-o-brutal Carel Struycken as any self-respecting Dutchman should.',neg
'The movie is a bit thin after reading the book but its still one of the greatest movies ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really vonneguty.

'This movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy just the kind of movie I usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested. It was really funny in one moment (probably why I liked it) and then just as serious in the next. Plus it had Ellen in it and Ive always had a soft spot for her.<br /><br />Basically the owner of a book store Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. She thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it. She has kind of shut herself off from the world so it really throws her for a loop. Eventually almost everyone connected with her finds this letter and they are all getting mixed signals which creates some really funny moments.<br /><br />Like I said I am usually not one for this type of movie but I really wound up enjoying it and recommend it highly.',pos
'How often do you see a film of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments? Waldos Last Stand is a refreshment. Here Waldo is selling lemonade but isnt making any money. Alfalfa Spanky Darla Mickey and Buckwheat come to visit him which is ironic because in both 3 Men In A Tub and Came The Brawn where there was competition between Alfalfa and Waldo for Darlas affection. Back to the story: The Gang taste the lemonade to see if Waldo made it right. One funny moment is when Alfalfa gets a glass cup for lemonade and Waldo fills is and gives it to Darla and Alfalfa has an angry expression on his face. Spanky proposes a floor show to go with the lemonade and even Mickey agrees ever so cute. When the floor show begins there is no one at the barn but then a customer comes in (Froggy). Spanky asks him if he wants lemonade but all he does is nod no. Spanky asks him numbers of time in the short and every time Froggy nods no Spanky displays many expressions on his face which is funny. Spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty. One way is when after Mickey said ever so cutely Those crackers are salty and they made me thirsty. There is also many entertain musical bit is this short. The opening number is by Darla which she tap dances and sings. The second includes Alfalfa singing off-key (as usually) with Mickey Leonard Spanky and Buckwheat about How dry I am! (I believe they sing that to make Froggy thirsty. It also made me laugh.). The closing number includes boys and girls all dressed up in an old fashion way. This was Waldos last Our Gang short.

'It SURPRISINGLY had a plot! ;) Ive seen movies with less plot (I dont wanna mention Asian movies but...). I thought the camera wasnt bad at all for a cheap movie like this and also the atmosphere wasnt too bad. There is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens. Although I do think that about a lot of movies in this case it was horrible of course.<br /><br />It ripped off some movies SO badly just for single scenes. The acting was bad but Ive seen worse. The movie was bad but Ive seen worse. Watching this film is an experience between boredom laughing fits death wish sadism horniness and entertainment on a low level.<br /><br />So if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you.<br /><br />I gave it 3/10 because it CAN be entertaining if you dont expect to see a good movie and youre in the right mood.',neg
'I really enjoyed this one and although the ending made me angry I still give it 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Four college girls (Baltron Kelly Stahl and Cadby) are driving down to Florida on their way they meet 2 guys (Turner Davis) they really add nothing to the plot but are at least somewhat likable. The girls agree to meet the guys in Florida for some fun but they have car problems and never make it. One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help the other three stay by the car.<br /><br />Soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes. Soon she witnesses as a man (March) strangles a woman in terror the girl flees the area she doesnt get very far but manages to get lost.<br /><br />Her friends by the car go looking for her they too go into the woods and run into the same man one of them sees the dead woman the man responds by shooting the girls head off the other girl runs away manages to make it back to the car where she is also killed.<br /><br />Eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested. This is when I started getting mad these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops dont believe them.<br /><br />They are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell the remaining friend manages to escape but not without getting in dangerous situations.<br /><br />This movie has nudity good actresses a shower scene imitating Psycho graphic violence towards women and solid story. Some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will NOT like the ending but over all this is a great little unknown movie.',pos
'The plot is somewhat original and all the actors did their job pretty well. There is a plenty of comic relief too. Some things do not make a lot of sense (e.g. the first chase scene why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?). The Russians actually speak Russian without accent but the cars are extremely strange with models spanning like 50 years and so the place seems weirdly out of time. Overall if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well.',pos
'The film is a joy to watch not just for the plot which is gripping but also for the superb performances of the actors Deneuve and Belmondo. Though considered a flop on its first release it has become a critical success and it is clear to see why. Deneuves acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it with saying what though it is divulged fairly early on. Belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist. I would recommend this film to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. It is a brilliant Hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does. The film is approx 2 hrs so you feel that you have not been sold short. Deneuve steals the show in this film and it is clear that at the time of making the film Truffaut was very much smitten with her. A definite must see for any cineaste or moviefan. 10/10',pos
'This movie is horrendous. The acting is cheesy and laughable. If you know anything at all about Rugby the match action is boring. In fact any episode of Power Rangers contains more realism than this movie. The action consists of no more than one pass and a shot of guy landing over the try line or being tackled without the ball and hectic hand held shots of who knows what. Its impossible to tell. There is nothing of the excitement skill and construction of try scoring that real Rugby contains. As for the haka this is a bunch of yanks trying to imitate a tradition they know nothing about much like the white rasta character that should have been left out of the film. Next time theres a Rugby movie made we can only hope that people who know Rugby make it.',neg
'I cant believe that the City of Muncie is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there. This show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law-enforcement officers. I have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life. If they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say it is reality is nothing short of a lie. I only saw it once and was appalled at what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy get into a foot-chase with a bad guy. What a joke that would have been. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world. The city of Muncie the Police Chief and all the officers should be hanging their heads in shame and should never want o admit they come from that city. No wonder it didnt stay around on TV',neg
'First and foremost I take issue to the title of this movie. Chupacabra is not a Spanish word. The name to which they are referring is Chupacabras. I imagine they dropped the s because it sounds plural that way but I assure you it is singular in Spanish.<br /><br />Next I thought this movie had been done years ago. It came off as one of those B horror flicks I watched when I was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town. Then it would have been kind of scary.<br /><br />Lets talk about the special effects. The most important effect is the costume used for the Chupacabras. Given that it is the main character you would think some serious money would have been put into it but that isnt so. The shape color and texture were all goofy like some stupid haunted house at Disney World.<br /><br />There were times when the Chupacabras was walking where no man could walk. His movement were jerky and strange at these times but moving around on the floor looked like any normal man.<br /><br />Another thing I take issue to is that there is no animal in the world that goes around slaughtering everything it sees with no regard to actually eating it. The Chupacrabas would kill one then the next but it never seemed to actually eat the victim. You say Its just a movie and I agree. But the idea is so far out there that its stupid.<br /><br />What country is Dr. Pena from? He sounds sort of Jamaincan/Hawaiian/British/Something-Else but I think hes supposed to be Latino. The problem is his accent is so bad that even a Russian could tell he wasnt Latino.<br /><br />The soldiers fired round after round at this thing and werent making a dent yet the continued to fire. Im no military man but dont soldiers especially the special tactical forces such as this have to have some wit about them to perform their duties? Wouldnt they figure out that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new? They didnt. They just kept firing away while the Chupacabras continued to slaughter and not eat them.<br /><br />Did they have to kill the little dog? :) Anyway my vote was 3 for this flick because it was bad. Why did I watch the whole thing? Im sure youve done the same on occasion so dont give me an flack. ;)',neg
'I dont know what the rest of you guys watch Steven Seagal movies for but I watch them because as silly as they are theyre at least always good for a laugh. Why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of?<br /><br />Attack Force is by no means a great movie but I felt it was as worthy a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other movies; in fact I didnt think it was one of his worst by a long-shot. It had most of the time a half-way coherent plot line and it was most of the time fundamentally exciting. The ending really sucked but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements. In the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised but I actually thought that the acting characterization (if I may use such a big word) and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect. Seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone-faced no-nonsense mans man that weve come to expect and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well without ever up-staging him. This people is what a Steven Seagal movie does. Deal with it. Or even better: laugh at it.<br /><br />4 out of 10.',neg
'This movie is #1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen with Lessons for an Assassin on the #2 spot.<br /><br />The acting is lousy (sorry Sandra Bullock but even your performance was horrible!) the music score could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous. It had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable words. But contrary to the average action movie there was no real action in this one. Boring.<br /><br />The only reason I continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie ...<br /><br />Thumbs down on this one.',neg
'When you get ahead of a film you know you are wasting your time watching the movie in question. That is exactly how I felt while I was watching Darkness. I could see anticipate every twist and turn easily. It is a combination of The Amityville Horror and a myriad of films that deal with the occult. It is so silly that I almost found endearing its naiveness. I cannot say I was wholly bored but I found the film way too derivative for my taste. Director Balagueró tries to redo his early Spanish hit The Nameless but he cannot pull it off. I admit a few sequences were creepy enough but I just abhor when I can figure out what is going to happen next. Also I hated to see good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini sweat so much over this piece of dreck. Finally Anna Paquin as the star of a horror film? This must be a joke. She is cute but she is one of those good child actors that have become a very monotonous adult actor. You can live without watching this one.',neg
'I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I cant understand why. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does. She hires Samuel L. Jackson who is a former police officer. Together they form a pair that is as entertaining as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song Shes Not There playing in the background. What follows is Geena and Samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. All through the rest of the film Geena has to decide who she really is. The killing unfeeling machine? The mother/schoolteacher with the quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially since the bad guys grab Geenas daughter. Great action scenes that rank up with any of the Die Hard movies!',pos

'After gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex-rental DVDs I figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than Sam Mendes? For a number of reasons American Beauty doesnt appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that Tom Hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade. For this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins and is simply wonderful to watch because of it. And despite my usual allergy to any film with Tom Hanks name on it (still cant watch Big without wanting a cat to kick) Im glad I gave this a try because this is one of those movies that youll kick yourself for if you miss it.<br /><br />Normally squeaky-clean Hanks plays Michael Sullivan a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during Prohibition in the early 1930s. He is also a professional hit-man to mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons. But after his eldest (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing the pair are forced to go on the run as John seeks to tidy the matter up. Soon father and son are pursued to Chicago where a fellow hit-man (a menacing Jude Law) is waiting for them.<br /><br />On the face of it it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as Ive said this isnt really about gangsters at all. Its about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances. Hanks is (*grits teeth*) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little Hoechlin is also good as Sullivans son. In all honesty there is not a single performance that I could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless. As is the cinematography and costumes (and its not often I praise costumes!) which recreates the 30s with stunning effect. There has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades. This could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30s look was difficult to put down - but it doesnt and that deserves every bit of credit. Chicago especially looks fantastic lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats. True time-travel even if a little CGI is needed.<br /><br />The story is also a winner offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain. Law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer Maguire and proves that you dont have to be Cagney or De Niro or Brando to play a gangster. The film is decidedly noir-ish driving rain and ill-lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are (finally) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts. The whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the Tommy-Gun shootouts and extortion rackets. It can feel a little slow in places especially if youre used to masses of gun-play in movies like most modern audiences (like yours truly) but sometimes words can speak louder than actions. Mendes has delivered a fine follow-up to his Oscar-winning debut a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch. Road To Perdition may not be to everyones tastes but this is one DVD I shall not be exchanging anytime soon.',pos
'With several name actors (Lance Henrikson David Warner Joe Don Baker) why was Jeffery Combs given the lead? Henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead as would Warner Baker or even others in the movie such as Charles Napier. Combs was miscast in this and did a poor job of it. Everything he did seemed fake or contrived.<br /><br />The script is poor. Meaning that if Lance Henrikson (or another) had the lead role he might have saved the film (removed it from my waste of time category) but it still would have been a bad movie. The screen play was completely lacking. The director should have recognized this and helped the movie along.',neg

Dae-su instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him after meeting the pretty Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) the two fall in love & together with her help Dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price...<br /><br />This South Korean production was co-written & directed by Chan-wook Park & has gotten any number of glowing reviews (the sort that distributors can pick quotes out & plaster them on the video box) & even won the Grand Prize of the Jury at Cannes while it was also nominated for the Golden Palm so surely Oldboy is a true classic? Well not for me it isnt since as I cant understand why its so liked & I would go as far as to say I pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments. For a start I couldnt get into the story at all I just didnt like it as I thought it was slow & boring & while many out there would have you believe Oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever I thought it was rather plain & not very well executed either. The ending in which Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending. At almost two hours I almost fell asleep I was so bored the violence is tame & its the thought of whats happening that I would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown. In fact Oldboy has a very low body count of about seven & one mild sex scene its really not that graphic or memorable. I didnt warm to any of the characters & while I accept Oldboy has an alright concept & premise it fails to deliver & its one film that I will never understand why so many people seem to like.<br /><br />Based on a Japanese Manga of the same name Oldboy the film looks alright theres one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot I was pretty unimpressed & thought the fight choreography was quite dull. The actual on-screen gore violence amounts to very little Dae-su eats a live Octopus which is apparently quite normal in Korea anyway there are some fight scenes a severed hand someones teeth are pulled out & theres a bit of blood at the end.<br /><br />The budget was supposedly around the $4000000 mark which is actually a fair bit filmed in South Korea & New Zealand. The acting looks alright but its hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language.<br /><br />Oldboy is a film that I found an absolute chore to sit through I dont mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as I followed the thing perfectly but I just didnt like any of it & its as simple & straightforward as that. Apparently the second in director Choi-wook Parks revenge trilogy which also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) & Lady Vengeance (2005).',neg
'Wow I knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad. Spoilerific comments ensue.<br /><br />Roddy Roddy Piper is sickly sweet retired cop (cliche!) helping out everyone - smiling like a post-op lobotomy patient through-out and lamenting over his dead son. His adopted son returns from Armed Forces Special Ops and because hes seen things - portrayed by clenching his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. Time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who the bad lad killed) and his adopted son.<br /><br />Oh the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the ex-Army bloke. This happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene.<br /><br />The action could have saved this film but its even worse than the storyline and acting. Its all been done before its all been done much much better (Ong-Bak is a prime example). This is the worst film Ive ever seen - and Ive seen Waterworld twice.<br /><br />Erm the film is called HONOR (Spelt Wrong for the Americans) and the tag line has from the makers of Bloodsport and Kickboxer - check out Director David Worths other films and youll soon realise why they put these 2 films on there even though they are over 10 years old. Such classics as Shark Attack 3: Megalodon - says it all really.<br /><br />Ill give you £10 if you dont go to see this film.<br /><br />PS - Apologise for not know character names tells you something though.',neg

'Have just seen this film for the first time after purchasing it on DVD<br /><br />It comes across as a cheap attempt to cash in on the two Conan movies.<br /><br />Unfortunately this film didnt appear to have the same budget as the Conan films and hence some of the sets and effects arent as flash and some scenes seem hurried. <br /><br />Nielsen is OK to look at but unfortunately she couldnt act if a gun was put to her head. <br /><br />Arnies supporting role looked like it was done as a favor to director Fleischer who also directed Conan the Destroyer. Maybe Arnie wasnt confident that he would go on to headline films like Predator Total Recall T2 etc.<br /><br />Some of the female guardians of the talisman early in the film looked like they were struggling to lift their swords and the looks on their faces suggested they were having great fun making this film. I couldnt be so jovial if I was fighting for my life.<br /><br />All this aside this film required very little concentration to watch and was mildly entertaining. Ive seen a lot worse.

'Pretty good film from Preminger; labyrinthine at times as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live. In this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying as its hero a good cop with a bad temper gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head.<br /><br />Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet and has never been better. The story may be pure melodrama but Andrews gives it weight and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. As his girl Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable. Gary Merrill makes for a very interesting villain with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to Andrews coolness; his smiling amiable-seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him. <br /><br />There are no major surprises in this film which seems transitional for all concerned. For director Preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his Laura stars Andrews and Tierney who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made. The supporting cast--Merrill Karl Malden Neville Brand--are understandably more optimistic as they were all on their way up. Preminger as serene an observer as ever lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain much less resolve.<br /><br />',pos
'I bought Unhinged because I got suckered by the gory picture on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box. All the kills are shown and I can honestly tell you that they look much better in the still frames than they do in the movie.<br /><br />Having said that lets look at the plot. A group of college girls driving to a rock concert (by way of the deep dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid) slide off the road. No visible damage is done to the car but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film (or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before filming began).<br /><br />The two remaining girls wake up in a big isolated house. The house by the way is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film. For some reason though this house has no roads going to it. The only way you can get to the main road is by hiking five miles through the woods. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged sitting around listening to weird conversations between an old rich bitch (who looks like George Washington in drag) and her equally homely sexually repressed daughter. The girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being that they packed more clothes than the cast of Gilligans Island for that three hour tour.<br /><br />By the time we the viewers get to the kill scenes we no longer care. We wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering . Unhinged finally wraps up with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better film. Its almost as though the ending the one good idea in the film was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it.<br /><br />Unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting inept directing and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porno film (sorry. Im not sure where that came from). You will get an idea of how bad this movie is during the opening credits when for some reason that is never explained the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering. Dont waste your time. Youll just feel Unhinged and want your time and money back.',neg

'Im sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview (yes SOS...) Why you could play full-court basketball in the torpedo room its so large. And how bout the bay windows in the bow the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere? Did I mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder? And the Admirals stateroom with what appears to be a loft? Big bleeping sub...<br /><br />OK OK...its never gonna win any prizes for authenticity. And if the sub is laughable the plot is even worse. Somehow the Van Allen belts of radiation hundreds of miles in space have caught fire are going to make global warming look like a weenie roast. Pompous Admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon) along with his sidekick Lucius (Peter Lorre looking suitably uncomfortable) hatch a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile into its midst.<br /><br />Theres plenty of intrigue (sic) along the way with a born-again survivor (and his little dog too!) two dames who can never leave well enough alone a passel of red shirts who are expendable and plot holes big enough for Godzilla to walk through. Thrill to the Seaview being chased at what looks like 60 miles per hour by another sub -- no need for advanced sonar when you can follow from 100 feet astern.<br /><br />The movie careens from one cliff-hanger to another; the payoff is so anticlimactic as to be pointless certainly not worth the 1 hour and 50 minute wait.<br /><br />The technical adviser for this shipwreck must have been a 14-year old boy with a stack of Popular Mechanics magazines.

'For all viewers out there who have slammed John Waters for creating a film like Pink Flamingos just stop. Its getting you nowhere. Has anyone ever cared to stop and think about the ambition and dedication Mr.Waters possesses. To gather your best friends up and to create a movie just to gross out thousands of viewers all over shows this man has a great deal of ambition inside himself. Just read his biography Shock Value.

'First I have to say that I have read everything about this subject and I know it inside out and I was excited about finally seeing it too. But you have to read only the book this mini-series is based on to realize that its not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. Its loosely based on the facts the rest is taken from the scriptwriters imagination. And unfortunately these changes are anything but successful and mostly totally unnecessary.<br /><br />Where do I begin? Vita and Violet didnt use the names Mitya and Lushka until their affair started and during it Violet also called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet who chased Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The seduction scene when their affair started Violet was much more passive than represented here and certainly didnt kiss Vita first. I could go on and on these examples were all included when the series was only just started. Besides all these alterations from the facts the characterizations are also all wrong. At times Vita behaves like a mad woman. Especially the scene where she saw from the newspaper Violets engagement announcement is just ridiculous. Vita kept her surges of emotion inside. It was Violet who was temperamental and let her feelings (good or bad) show. All Vita did when she read it was that she nearly fainted thats all. Being a gentle nature Harold avoided confrontations in real life but here he is sometimes pretty stern and accusing. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate things in letters not verbally. And Violet... I know that this series purposely concentrated on Vita and Harold but that doesnt mean that all the other characters have to be mere puppets on the sidelines. Here she is totally one-dimensional character and the lines gave to her are mostly embarrassingly shallow. Actually she was intelligent gifted quite an extraordinary woman who has rarely given the credit she deserves. I have always thought her much more interesting person than Vita. In this series her unhappiness loneliness and her problems with her mother are totally ignored. Viewer has also little clue of her background and family what kind of relation (and marriage) with Denys Trefusis she had or how hard she battled over Vita. Vita was the only love of her life her raison detre and if Harold suffered during affair so did Violet. After it her life was in ruins and it took time that she could pull herself back together again. Statue could have acted the role of Denys that much depth his character has. Lady Sackville-West is just a badly drawn caricature; an annoying chatterbox with exaggerating french accent. <br /><br />The series ends to the totally badly written scene in Amiens and that was the end of this affair according to scriptwriter. No it continued a whole year after that and its ending was much more lingering and sad than what was presented here. But what one cares about the stupid ending if the whole series has been stupid from the start. I have to give some credit to actors they tried to make best of those roles given to them though Janet McTeer as Vita is the only one who really shines through. One cant complain the settings either. All complaints go to director and most of all scriptwriter. Instead of insightful character studies there are too many sex scenes and bland conversation. Many of the scenes are too long some are pointless and dont bring anything to the story line. On the other hand many details are shortened or omitted altogether. Especially there should have been more information about Vitas and Violets youth and how their friendship developed. This is one fascinating story which would have deserved a much better adaptation. Maybe someday someone will do it. At the moment one can make much more of this story by reading the actual book or Violets letters to Vita which are brilliant stuff.',neg
'Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown the fact that it was written by Dan Brown and because Dan Browns name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind and expected the worse but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump and that is by all means good entertainment value.<br /><br />The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) jets off to Rome after the Popes sudden death and the re-election through Papal Conclave. Arranging all of this is the carmelengo Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However he soon learns of a new threat one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known an anti-matter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon using his intellects (and trust me youll be hearing a LOT from it) is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination. Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer) who is also the co-creator of the anti-matter. <br /><br />The movie itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes evidently slowing the books much anticipated action/thriller sequences down. It makes for an interesting read on paper but on screen it can go either way. <br /><br />The characters are decently written onto the big screen. Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna famous accent included. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile intellectually and physically since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter the straight-faced leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately neither his nor Ayelet Zurers performance are worthwhile ones and instead of playing a part in the story they are just kicked aside as assets. <br /><br />However Angels & Demons accomplishes what DVC could never; a thrilling fast-paced movie filled with satisfying explosions beautiful recreations of St. Peters Square and Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour. Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases (almost). <br /><br />While newcomers might call it a National Treasure 3 with a much larger threat there is still enough contagious suspense/thriller eye-candy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in. Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates A&D does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder. <br /><br />A good book-to-movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain.<br /><br />7.4/10',pos

Its bad enough that shes such a terrible actress (Route 666 Bates Motel) but she doesnt even qualify as a mediocre b-movie actress.

'Visually this film is interesting. Light is literally thrown in a way together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles that had my hopes up at the start but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie no matter how much spectacle is seen. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish one of the most well-known serial-killers in the world. Active around the start of the 20th century Fishs life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age. This film is based upon two tracks: Fishs life and that of William F. King lead investigator of the case. What saves this film from becoming a Hallmark spectacle and debacle of the usual sort whenever films about serial killers are concerned is the direction which is a double-edged sword; director Scott L. Flynn sheds focus enough upon the b-actors not to let their flaws shine through too much but at the same times created a truly dull and stereotypical view of the American police through the King-angle. Sure enough he dealt quite thoroughly with Fishs meet with Grace Budd the 10-year-old girl that he killed even though Im not really sure if her mother was the media-crazed person that Flynn really tries to emphasise that she was. I miss more psychological diving into Fish not to mention the very little time which was spent on Fishs post-capture. All in all interesting for those who are into serial-killers but mostly a let-down; however if the director will make another film about another serial-killer Id definitely see it in hopes that holes were patched-up.',neg
'Surely one of the lamest shows ever to be produced on these shores and thats saying something. Even many of the lead actors didnt stick around for the duration. The fact that it ran for eight years is a sad indictment on the average intelligence and cultural nous of the Aussie viewer. It went round and round in circles with repetitive gags and poorly-drawn characters. Arthur MacArthur for gods sake. did they actually pay the writers of this show? I wonder if anyone checked their qualifications. There were tired gags about rural people and second-rate farce situations that were poor imitations of a thousand English and US sitcoms that had gone before. I think thats what I hate about it so much that it appears no one involved wanted to make it memorable original or clever instead opting for the lowest common denominator each time.',neg
'Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. If you saw the original film youll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears rather than meeting them later. However I have no problems with that preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are adorable and its fun watching them play and grow. My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter. I could empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart love the toys or enjoyed the original this is not to be missed. 9/10',pos

'I first read the book when I was a young teenager then saw the film late one night. About a year ago I checked it out on IMDb and discovered no copies available. I then hit the web and found a site that offers War Films soooo glad that I did ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why I wanted to see it again.<br /><br />In my opinion to really enjoy the film I suggest you read get a copy of the book and then watch the film. The book is no longer in print but I did track a copy down via E-bay the Author Alan White was a commando/paratrooper during the 2nd world war taking part in disparate clandestine operations and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows and this fact I believe gives the book and film authenticity. I have not given the film a ten only because of the nature of the ending of the film not as good as the book. There are a couple of plot lines that differ from the book also which is strange as the book is not about the large scale nature of war but about the individual in war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him watch in that order.<br /><br />If you can track it down the book and the film then it is definitely worth it and I only wish that it was more readily available for more to read and see one of my all best war films ever!',pos
'The Last Wave is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind.

Around this time there has been unusually heavy rainfall in Australia. While defending the Aborigines David learns the last wave theory and begins to wonder whether its just mythology.<br /><br />The movies last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of ones mind.

'I watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh ive had in a long while. The plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way. The only plus to be found anywhere in the film are Corey Saviers impressive abs. Alexandra Paul (i think thats her name) is horrendous as the preachers wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is gross and his characters a twit on top of it all. And as if the fact that you think shes having sex with her son isnt enough they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity! The end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable. I mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him!',neg
'While I cant deny that his movies are often entertaining I have always personally felt that Martin Scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities. His use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream Look at me arent I an imaginative director?. His best film that I have seen is the one with the least added flourishes the superlative Raging Bull.<br /><br />For this remake it appears it was business as usual though. The dull film stock to convey a 1950s setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself. The melodramatic close-ups combined with the sub-par imitation of the classic Psycho score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror. The score for Psycho was brilliantly unnerving this homage just sounds shrill and annoying. Even the cast who can be decent at times deliver histrionic performances that just scream caricature; the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by Lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family.<br /><br />The worst acting offender here is surprisingly De Niro. Sure he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away. Now Im no expert on American accents me originally coming from near Manchester in England an all but surely he couldve come up with a more convincing Southern drawl than that? Being the gifted physical actor he is he almost overcomes this fatal flaw but not quite. It was disconcerting for me as a De Niro fan to be wishing he was off screen rather than rapt at his performance.<br /><br />(POSSIBLE SPOILERS.)<br /><br />The over-the-top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale. When will Scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment? I also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the killer-not-dead-yet cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ.<br /><br />All in all a thoroughly ridiculous thriller. Scorsese and De Niro have done MUCH better work together.',neg

Totally absorbed with its subject the film becomes incapable of leveling any sort of critical commentary with regard to Ms. Faye. Cloying and sappy the only redeeming quality of the film was its use of puppets in an attempt (albeit a failed one) to structure some kind of narrative.

'Ive noticed that a lot of people are taking Opera to task for the way Betty reacts to the murders. I think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine a normal person would react. The thing is...Betty is not a normal person due to traumatic events in her childhood. She has problems way way before the movie ever even starts...and by the end of Opera...in my opinion...she has become totally unhinged.<br /><br />---------------------SPOILERS--------------------------------------- You have to keep in mind that when she was a very small child she witnessed her mothers lover commit at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochist mother was getting off watching it.<br /><br />She was raised by a woman who achieves sexual release tied up watching girls get hacked slashed and strangled to death. That does not make for a healthy home life. I think its pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have employed all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never snitched on her. It is also likely that at her impressionable age Betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw. Is this just something that adults do etc.<br /><br />Betty obviously looks up to her mother...I mean...shes become an opera singer just like her. If mommy likes it it cant be bad can it...mommy cant be bad can she? She couldnt tell the police on her mommy or this mysterious hooded fellow she associates with mommy.<br /><br />Betty has a lot of deep-seated emotional issues. Her mind has for years been trying to block out the memory of what she saw her mother doing...but it keeps coming to the surface manifesting itself in the form of horrible nightmares skull-throbbing migraines a dependence on relaxation techniques and sexual frigidity She associates brutal violence/bloody death with sex on a subconscious level. Theres an inner struggle between the part of Betty that has confused murder/sex and the part of her which believes these things to be wrong.<br /><br />After shes seen her boyfriend murdered by the hooded man...she calls the police yet is unwilling to give her name. The part of her that thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call but the part that is ambivalent wont allow her to admit personal involvement. The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way. So she walks away from the phone in the rain...and when shes picked up by the director shes acting surprisingly calm not as upset as you would think a normal person would be...because the part of her thats been blocking stuff since she was a child is trying its damnedest to block the horror of what shes just witnessed.<br /><br />The state of affairs in her life all contribute to an impasse within Bettys psyche. Her singing career is starting to bear fruit...shes going to be a great opera singer like her mother was. But is she going to become like her mother in all ways? In the darker ways? Or will she be able to make her own path? Add this to the re-emergence of the hooded man murdering everyone around her.<br /><br />Its not until the hooded man kills Daria Nicolodis character that Betty really takes an active role in defeating the killer. Heres someone who loves Betty whos supported her wholeheartedly in her emerging career who is in fact a maternal figure in Bettys life now since mommys dead. Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then to see the woman who is the closest thing you have to a mother get shot through the eyeball.<br /><br />I could go on...but I wont. The main gist of what Im saying is that the character of Betty is a lot more complex than most of the reviewers on here have been willing to acknowledge.<br /><br />Opera is one of Argentos best...and not just for the visuals alone (although they are truly magnificent) and not just for the inventive murders (although they are). There is a depth here...and attention needs to be paid.',pos
'What a boring movie. While it did have humorous parts it was just plain boring and lengthy (for a 90 minute movie). I believe that the cause was a lack of action.<br /><br />When I rented this movie I expected to see white blood cells combat the evil viruses but no such luck. It was more that the virus was thwarted than defeated.<br /><br />The movie had promise but since made for little kiddies in mind it did not meet its potential in my opinion.',neg
'If you like horror or action watch this film ASAP. If the opening scene doesnt get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse. Great Action excellent casting and top one-liners. This is the only film I have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop kick & punch thrown. Not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun. Its a pure rush of dark comic book action. 9/10',pos
'THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of Neil Simons play about a retired vaudevillian team played by Walter Matthau and George Burns who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that. The problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as Matthaus nephew a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment...vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of Neil Simons better screenplays and outstanding work by Matthau Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this but I think Matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor but didnt stand a chance against Nicholson for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST; however in another year this was an Oscar-worthy performance. Matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance. The scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and cant get the name of the product right is a classic. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning Neil Simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns.',pos
'If ever a potential movie mustve sounded like it wouldnt work based on reading the script on paper it would be this one. Here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft-porn s&m flick complete with the huge in-theatre poster depicting a near-naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with soulful power to spare its Craig Brewers redemptive follow-up to Hustle & Flow Black Snake Moan.<br /><br />Unashamedly over the top from the get go this film sucks you in with the opening scenes and proceeds to dig deeper and deeper in with every subsequent frame. Its yer basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move on in more positive ways with their lives. Been done before of course this tale but as Ive always said its the manner in which a story is told that gives it heart depth meaning and power.<br /><br />Riccis damaged-by-childhood-abuse wild-child character Rae and Jacksons equally soulsick musician character Lazarus find each other under desperate circumstances and Laz takes it upon himself to try to help Rae. This in itself is relatively unique: the idea of a man trying to genuinely help a woman who is in serious pain rather than trying to take further advantage of her and we know from the onset that Lazs heart and the films heart is in the right place. The movie at its core is about the redemptive healing power of love (with music as a very close second) and the film resonates profoundly with this truth - soulfully artfully and brilliantly.<br /><br />A major reason the film succeeds so profoundly is because of the fierce committed performances from Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would have come off as laughable and pathetic in lesser artists hands are instead powerful as all get-out. In particular the films arc scene in which Jackson sings and plays the song of the title alone in his house with Ricci amidst a serious thunderstorm and the abusive demons from Raes past running amok inside her head leading her to crawl to Lazarus and cling to his leg comes off not ridiculous as technically it should but rather as gut-wrenchingly cathartic. <br /><br />All the supporting performances are fantastic here too. Justin Timberlake is completely believable as Raes anxiety-ridden boyfriend Ronnie and the always-wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also perfectly cast as a character who obviously has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is outstanding as well as Lazs reverend friend R.L. (a nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside no doubt). Everything works about this movie lets face it including the music/soundtrack which features Burnside Scott Bomar Bobby Rush Son House and most importantly Jackson himself whose fantastic version of Stackolee I am listening to as I compose this review. Theres also a really beautiful and moving version of This Little Light of Mine featured in the film sung heart-breakingly tentative and soft by Ricci.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson has said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this movie is the best of his career thus far; I could not agree with him more. This is work that he can be monumentally proud of along with everyone else involved in this audacious supremely wise and deeply heartfelt mother*ucker of a project.',pos
'This is one of the best horror movies ive seen in a while. An eerie abandon house interesting characters gore and a twisted plot. Who could ask for anything more in a horror movie? It is pretty predictable for the most part but then again most horrors you can figure out within the first 10 minutes so I wont hold that against it. The music camera angles and so forth are excellent. The sets are well make and very convincing. There was pretty much no subplots however it being a horror movie too many alternate plots only take away from what were wanting from a horror anyhow... To be scared... This one keeps it pretty simple and does just that. If I were to compare it to any other movie I would say it reminded me of the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Definitely a horror movie lover must see.',pos
'I had been waiting to see this movie for so long and finally got to yesterday. In summary Im glad I finally did. The humor is off the wall hilarious. The plot is so unbelievably believable that it has to have at least some truth for it . If anything stood out in this movie it is most definitely the coffee shop scene. I have been there every guy has . You get dumped. You find out that your ex has fooled around with some guy who you are sure is an asshole. Now every time you see anything for the next few days you just get horrible thoughts of this placed in all the wrong areas . She is screwing everyone and everyone knows it. I could probably watch that man lick and finger his wallet all day long and look back at myself and laugh for having been there too .',pos
'I have never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House puts all of the newer shows to shame big time! Anyone who has never seen it which I dont see how it is possible should see it. It is a great show for anyone of any age. Full House will make you laugh it will make you cry it will amaze you. True some people feel that there are some cheesy aspects to the show but the positive aspects out weigh all of the cheesy aspects. Full House ran its first episode on September 22 1987 entitled Our Very First Show and ran its last episode on May 23 1995 entitled Michelle Rides Again Part II.<br /><br />The plot of the show is very believable. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) losses his wife Pam in an accident involving a drunk driver. Danny has his brother in law Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos) which is Pams younger brother and Danny also brings in his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) to help him raise his three daughters. Dannys daughters are named DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen).Joey and Jesse plan on moving in with Danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years; which is the number of years the show ran for.<br /><br />The following is a short description of some of the characters and the actor/actress who played him/her: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a great actor. He plays Jesse. Jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break. In Full House John Stamos does a great job portraying his character. He looked and played music like his idol Elvis Presley.<br /><br />Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a great actor. He looses his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver. He has to raise three girls without a having the girls Mother. Bob Saget does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls.<br /><br />Dave Coulier (Joey): One word can describe Dave Coulier funny. He is great. Playing the character of Joey was perfect for him. He does a great job playing the stand-up comedian waiting for his big break.<br /><br />Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She is a tremendous actress. She plays the oldest sister DJ which is short for Donna Jo. She is one of the best actresses I have ever seen. Her acting ability in Full House was very believable.<br /><br />Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin incredibly amazing! I wish I could say every thing that I would like to say about Jodie but I would use up the 1000 word maximum just on her. She got her start in a kids show called Mother Goose Stories and when she came to Full House she blew the audiences and creators mind. Her great looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success that it was. According to Dave Coulier Jodie was supposed to be the star of the show. It was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break. Jodie at five years old when the show first aired could hit every line perfectly. She showed great enthusiasm. Most young kids cant do this. As you can probably guess Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House.<br /><br />Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Great actress. Full House is where they got their start. They received the part of Michelle because they were the only babies who did not cry while in front of a camera.<br /><br />There are many more cast members that should be recognized. These are the original characters from when the show first went on the air in 1987.<br /><br />The only negative thing that I can say is how Full House became The Michelle Show towards the end. I think it was to focused on her towards the end. Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were much better at acting.<br /><br />Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy such as loosing a family member occurs. Full House continues to attract new fans. With all this said there is only a couple things left to say; Full House will never die and thank you the cast of Full House for giving everyone a show that they can enjoy.',pos
'The story of Ed Gein is interesting VERY interesting. This movie however interesting only in the fact that it was actually made. Kane Hodders portrayal of Ed Gein is so far off its not even the slightest bit funny. Ed Gein did not behave psychotic in public he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everybody and talked to anybody who would listen this is one of the major things this movie failed to show the audience. But the biggest mistake of this movie side from even one frame ever being shot was that Ed never killed anyone without having been told to do so by his dead mother whom he thought was speaking to him from beyond the grave. He killed only the people who his dead mother said he had to because it was Gods will and he was very remorseful about it though that didnt stop him from experimenting with cannibalism and wearing peoples flesh. I officially gave this movie a rating of 1 simply because 0 wasnt given to me as an option.<br /><br />I highly advise all to stay clear of this movie. If you want to see a movie that accurately depicts Ed Gein and doesnt try to put in a sub-plot love story between a cop and a fictional woman who never existed i HIGHLY advise you see the original movie which unfortunately seems to not be on IMDb.com though i could be wrong but i have yet to find it here. The original doesnt stray from the actual events and doesnt try to twist the story. I can understand telling the story from a different perspective but this movie just tried to straight change the true story itself something that i find as horrible as if someone made a movie based on 9/11 but gave it a twist that Canada was behind it. Or a WWII movie saying Hitler was a good guy and helped fight the Nazis.',neg

'Yes Marie Dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running.<br /><br />Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen.<br /><br />I watched this for Polly Moran whom Ive seen elsewhere. Here Moran is OK -- just OK -- as Dresslers shrewish friend/foe. Too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion.<br /><br />The plot is good hearted. Bad guys try to rob the townspeople. Dressler triumphs and all ends well.<br /><br />I do wonder about the central plot mechanism: bonds. This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly. I however not of that era am vaguely familiar with them. Theyre like stocks only different right? It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity.',neg
'Hey I didnt order no cab! Yeah well you got one... What can I say about Hack...what a man among men. He was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold. If you were able to (and fortunately for Americas TV viewers...one person per week was) penetrate the cold hard surface of Hacks exterior you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice. The show was superb I laughed I cried I smiled...all in the same episode. My arms would break out in goosebumps when our dear friend Hack would exit his cab in another dark alley...with nothing more than his fists...ready to avenge a wronged civilian. A smile would break out on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in a dark alleys facial expressions when the Taxi of Justices headlights illuminated upon his face. Week after week I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to bask in the warmth glow of Hacks brilliance. I have never seen a better show and I mourned the loss of one of Americas greatest treasures when the show was canceled. In other Hack-related news I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I are expecting Hack Koen to come into the world in about three weeks.',pos

Its a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart.<br /><br />There arent any other live animal movies that I can think of at the moment that I even could compare with let alone like as much as this one. I might be giving too much praise to this movie but I dont think show. I really holds that great message that Home is where the heart is. Or at least thats the message I gained from it.

It was too long and dragged the movie along. Though the dancing is great would have been much better left on the DVD as a Deleted Scene.<br /><br />All in all this is a great movie.

'I saw an early screening of this film in New York and I along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed. The movie wasnt even so bad it was good; it was as lifeless as a snake-bite victim. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame. It reminded me of one of those cheesy SciFi movies except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy. It all seemed worn flat and overtly formulaic. Im shocked to say I actually think Anaconda was more fun. Its easy to understand that SOAP realizes its a piece of s*it and plays along with it but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense. Its the worst kind of lame movie: its joyless.',neg
'This was one of the most boring horror movies that I have ever seen. A college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at Alcatraz. Trying to deliver a mix of Nightmare on Elm Street and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story. Although being such a bad and often laughable movie (dig those mullets and the terrible dialog) it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Dont be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the Silver Scroll Award by the Academy of Sicence Fiction Fanatasy and Horror or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack or that Tony Basil has a part in the film. It is a giant disaster though one with a small cult following (see the other IMDb comments for this film).',neg
'This is the last of four swashbucklers from France Ive scheduled for viewing during this Christmas season: the others (in order of viewing) were the uninspired THE BLACK TULIP (1964; from the same director as this one but not nearly as good) the surprisingly effective LADY Oscar (1979; which had originated as a Japanese manga!) and the splendid CARTOUCHE (1962). Actually I had watched this one not too long ago on late-night Italian TV and recall not being especially bowled over by it so that I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it this time around (also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming DVD release from Criterion).<br /><br />Incidentally FANFAN LA TULIPE has quite a bit in common with the afore-mentioned CARTOUCHE: not just cast and crew members (producers Georges Dancigers and Alexandre Mnouchkine cinematographer Christian Matras actor Noel Roquevert) but plot-wise as well  in fact the hero is a womanizing soldier (Jean-Paul Belmondos Cartouche had also had a brief military spell) whos loved by a fiery girl (in this case gypsy Gina Lollobrigida) while hes himself obsessed by an impossible love (here its none other than the kings daughter)! As in the later film too Fanfan (an ideally cast Gerard Philipe who ironically is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years time) is flanked by two fun-loving yet cowardly men (one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroines own father) and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks (the ageing Roquevert with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl)!; for the record Lollobrigida will rejoin Philippe in her next film Rene Clairs delightful romantic fantasy LES BELLES DE NUIT (1952).<br /><br />FANFAN proved to be a big box-office hit on its home-ground and even copped a surprising (but well-deserved) Best Direction award at Cannes over more renowned films like AN American IN Paris (1951) DETECTIVE STORY (1951) OTHELLO UMBERTO D. and VIVA ZAPATA! In fact its popularity ensured its re-release in a computer-colored version (presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldnt touch a black-and-white product with a ten-foot pole) and the Criterion DVD itself contains a sample from this variant; being obviously a foreign-language title theres also the dubious choice of an English-dubbed soundtrack but even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering when all is said and done theres simply no substitute for the original! <br /><br />FANFAN LA TULIPE (a nickname given the hero by a young Genevieve Page as the celebrated Madame De Pompadour) contains about as much comedy as (the expected) action and romance; while some may find this overwhelming I dont agree myself as I enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and on the whole this combination is comparable with Jerzy Skolimowskis equally droll THE ADVENTURES OF GERARD (1970). That said the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise (particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent) and the film itself rather adult at times (with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout) when viewed back-to-back with vintage Hollywood fare as I did now; the climax then is quite ingenious: the enemy forces (who amusingly are made to speak in speeded-up gibberish!) are depleted by our heroic trio alone much to the kings amazement who as portrayed by Marcel Herrand  best-known for his role of leader of the Parisian underworld in Marcel Carnes CHILDREN OF PARADISE (1945)  is himself something of a lecher.<br /><br />P.S. An Italian TV channel has been threatening to screen Christian-Jaques promising CHAMPAGNE FOR SAVAGES (1964) for months now but despite programming it three times already (with a tentative fourth one slated for next week) they have yet to show it; even so I do have three more films of his in my unwatched VHS pile (equally culled from late-night Italian TV screenings): the three-hour epic LA CHARTREUSE DE PARME (1948; also starring Gerard Philippe) THE SECOND TWIN (1967) and THE LEGEND OF FRENCHIE KING (1971; with Brigitte Bardot and Claudia Cardinale).',pos
'Its a ghost story. Its a cannibalism story. Its a revenge story. Its a very poorly done film with a lot of violence. I suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie youve ever seen. It has the usual isolated place the cocky campers heading off to the wilderness. Granted there are some pretty intense scenes. Its just so dull. Bad editing and the whole works. There are ghost children who sound like they are talking into a wastebasket. Im not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the seed cap are playing by. It also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually whats left of his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous sick violence. I fear that its just another step in our desensitized evolution. Three is no cleverness here no tongue in cheek only a sad waste of time. Lots of blood; little plot.',neg

'I just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 mins of ROLL.<br /><br />Roll is about a country boy Mat (Toby Malone) who has dreams of becoming a Sports Star. Mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well that was the plan anyway. George is involved with a gangster Tiny (John Batchelor) and is making a delivery for him. Needless to say Mat gets dragged into Georges world. <br /><br />I thought it was great how Mat teaches George some morals and respect while George teaches Mat how to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job.<br /><br />Every character in the movie complimented each other very well the two cops were great. David Ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie. Tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters Pando from Two Hands.<br /><br />One of the other things that I liked about Roll was that it showcased the cities that I grew up and lived in for 20 years Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see sights and landmarks that I grew up with especially the old Ferris wheel.<br /><br />This Rocks n Rolls',pos
'Dr. Cameron a discredited scientist succeeds with his experiment in creating serum the transforms men into wolf-like creatures. Originally developing this formula to help the world the scientist decides to use his newly created subject to exact revenge upon the scientists who were responsible for his ouster from the scientific community. The scientists daughter Lenora grows wary of her fathers actions and shares her suspicions with a newspaper reporter. When the scientist loses control of his creature it falls upon the scientists daughter and the reporter to stop it according to the DVD sleeves synopsis.<br /><br />Mad scientist George Zucco (as Lorenzo Cameron) creates his formula rather unimaginatively by mixing human and wolf blood. This brings the beast out in hulking Glenn Strange (as Petro aka Pedro) who is directed to act like Lon Chaney Jr. in Of Mice and Men. Johnny Downs (as Tom Gregory) and Anna Nagel (as Lenora Cameron) are a likable werewolf hunter and damsel in distress. Certainly The Mad Monster is no substitute for The Wolf Man; but its a serviceable addendum. The grainy black-and-white photography enhances the foggy cow-webbed atmosphere.

'Another example of the women-in-prison genre. This is not exactly a genre known for quality films but this is a notch below most. A bunch of women are taken from the bordellos where they work to a prison on a rocky island. Once there they are subjected to lots of poorly directed sex and atrocious dialog. For a film with an astounding amount of sex and nudity there is really nothing erotic about any of it. The sex scenes are awkwardly acted and some scenes like the shower scene seem to drag on and on. That said there are at least some minimal production values. On the W-i-P scale I would put it above Frauen fur Zellenblock Neun but below Chained Heat.',neg
'This movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors. I only knew about it because I am a long time Jean-Claude Van Damme fan and I always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (Derailed Second In Command) they are. This movie has an easy enough plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme Scott Adkins and the final one of them together. The editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but Isaac Florentine can definitely film a good fight scene. I too am happy that Van Damme has been acting better lately (In Hell Wake of Death Until Death) but with the good acting came less martial arts. In The Shepherd Van Damme proves that he still has it.',pos
'I was so glad I came across this short film. Im always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards I was so pleased that I actually had a film that I was rooting for.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple the director writer and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals. The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy.<br /><br />Its a well made short film well edited and the actors all do a great job. And the last shot of the film is perfect.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.',pos
'I really love anything done by Savage Steve Holland the writer/director of this great movie. Also see Better Off Dead and How I Got Into College. Wonderful! Anyway this movie is really humorous and delivers some unexpected things. Where else but in this movie can you see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwait as a twin? I recommend this to anybody looking for some old fashioned slapstick comedy (George with the turtle raft) not to mention some really well written sarcasm (the Christmas tree on the roof of the car). This movie constantly throws you unexpected things even after youve seen it 100 times like I have! Enjoy!',pos

I want to mention to The Diceman from Germany theres no reason to feel that he sucks when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. Like I said I dont understand Japanese -or at least only the very small amount I came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- bably my favorite all time book which I could not put down & took the next day off from work just to finish reading!

'Dance Fools Dance is an early Crawford-Gable vehicle from 1931. Crawford plays a Bonnie Jordan a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties booze and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming. This all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) penniless. Bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name Mary Smith; her brother goes to work for bootleggers. The head man is Jake Luva - portrayed by Clark Gable as he plays yet another crook. Later of course he would turn into a romantic hero but in the early 30s MGM used him as a bad guy. Not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity Bonnie cozies up to Luva.<br /><br />Gable and Crawford made a great team. Her facial expressions are a little on the wild side but that along with her dancing is one of the things that makes the movie fun.

Carl meets his brothers girlfriend Sunny and the two of them quite unmotivated some kind of private investigation about Jasons death and Carl gets involved in Jasons ex-life that was filled with clubs and drugs. The movie itself seen from an artistic point of view is nothing more than a big pile of s**t. The plot is predictable all of the characters are extremely cliched and two-dimensional (stupid boy from a small town young good-looking innocent girl big bad drug king... the list is endless) and most of the acting such as the plot are just not credible. Matthew Rhys performance of the stupid boy coming to big London and sudden taking drugs from people he does not even know does not seem very credible unlike his female counterpart Sunny performed by Sienna Guillory whose behaviour seems more realistic to the spectator. Nothing more than a joke was Tim Currys performance of the drug king Damian: a phony caricature too eeeevil and just too ridiculous to be true.<br /><br />BUT: If you like club music (the club scenes such as the selected tracks are simply brilliant) if you enjoy a simple lovestory with a sweet girl like Sunny (yes I confess I lost my heart ;)... that makes my comment even more subjective I guess) with some (predictable) twists and turns you will definetely enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Anybody else: F.O.R.G.E.T.....I.T.!<br /><br />3 out of 10 (objective view)<br /><br />7 out of 10 (my personal view and also my final vote)',pos
'All of the people reviewing this film and probably many professional film reviewers just dont get it. This film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what Im talking about I suggest you get any of Zemans films such as The Fabulous World of Jules Verne Baron Munchausen Journey to the Beginning of Time or On The Comet. If you are unable to locate a film then read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If one were to look at Zemans work and try to compare it to any of the other sci/fi fantasy films of the time viewers probably wouldnt have gotten it then either. It is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers styles to the standard technologies of the day because both Zemen and Hines do not compute. They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only. If you look at this film from a perspective where you KNOW that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. It isnt easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow. I thought that the creatures were also quite good also considering how they were made. Hines took a great gamble and I think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come. Someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual CG work. Regarding the actors I think Hines also took a page from Zemens book in that many of Zemens actors were somewhat expressionless at first but became much more engaging as the film and action went on. It is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library. I will watch it for years to come all three great hours of it.',pos
'I saw this recently on a faded old VHS tape and remembered it dimly. Looking at it now it seems charming.<br /><br />When it was first released it was recognized by pretty much everyone as a spoof of coming out as a gay teenager. To hammer the point home the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of 1 Teenager In 10 the most popular coming out book of the time. David Warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter [= gay-hating evangelist] who is of course a self-loathing closet case. The list of sight gags and in-jokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into. The producers were having some good-natured fun and hoping no doubt to lighten-up as well as to enlighten.<br /><br />But I have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film nowadays. In some places where there is education and culture the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past. But Im sure there are plenty of dark nasty corners of our continent where its just as bad as it always was.',neg
'The version of this film I saw was titled Horror Rises from the Tomb. The horror in question is a wicked Medieval magician played by Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy looking like hes playing Abanazer in a church hall panto. He rises from his tomb when a stupid descendant (I think hes a descendant as hes also played by Naschy)returns to his ancestral home and reunites the magicians head and body which had been separated by by the witchfinders who executed him in an attempt to stop him er rising from the tomb.<br /><br />Obviously once head and body are back together all hell breaks loose and lots of people die. Like all good magicians Abanazer here has a lovely assistant. This ones played by another Spanish horror great the beautiful Helga Line. Like practically every other woman in the film Line periodically gets her kit off. Theres a LOT of nudity in this film and not just female - we even get to see Naschys paunchy body which isnt a pretty sight I can tell you. Most of the films sex angle is laughably gratuitous. Theres one particularly funny scene where Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to both have a grope of the nubile young blonde theyve possessed.<br /><br />Its also pretty gory in places - notably a Herschell Gordon Lewis-esquire moment where Line plunges her hands into a mans chest to remove his heart.<br /><br />The best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end. Theyre quickly scared off by a fire though and dont bother coming back. Which is a shame. The scene where the zombies rise however is the films most ludicrously inept moment. It all happens in long shot and we havent really got a clue whats happening until we see some figures shambling on from the distance. There are several rubbish moments like this thanks largely to poor editing. When a labourer falls under the hypnotic spell of Naschys head theres a big close up of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose whatsoever.<br /><br />All in all not a great horror film but entertaining enough. Of course the version I saw was a dubbed American version that had probably been chopped to pieces. For all I know the original Spanish version could be a masterpiece...',neg

Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister a divorced small-town nurse whose depression... over the fact that the hospital ER she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a $100000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt). The picture shows an act of bravery performed by Noahs firefighter brother Hank (William Russ) who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and hasnt been seen since. Hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare but this proves impossible when Noahs newspaper posts a $50000 reward to identify Hank known only to the public as John Christmas. And theres something very very curious about that photo: It also shows a Santa Claus suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant. That elusive Santa is of course the angelic Max who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of guises to solve problems dispense advice tie up loose plot strands--and even share a musical duet with Kathleens talented daughter Socorro (Jennifer Pisana).<br /><br />INTERESTED IN HAVING A COPY: WRITE TO ME HERE: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM',pos
'Even though this is the first film by the broken lizard group its the last one I saw. Having mildly enjoyed Super Troopers and managed to sit through the crap that is club dred and beerfest I was surprised to hear they did an earlier film. Now i didnt sit down with high hopes but was hoping for a funny campus romp. My friend asked me to keep in mind they are younger (obviously) and its their first foray into film. I did and was still disappointed. Not taking away the acting and comedy skills of the BL guys they were OK. The whole film was tiresome clichéd and frankly boring. Some of the other actors in the film were really poor at acting. And the Rugby game didnt even resemble rugby. Poor showing. They improved drastically with Super Troopers and have declined since. Lets hope they get back on form with Super Troopers 2',neg
'From hardly alien sounding lasers to an elementary school style shuttle crash Nightbeast is better classified as a farcical mix of fake blood and bare chest. The almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of cohesive or effective story. The acting however is not nearly as beastly many of the young aspiring actors admirably showcase a hidden talent. Particularly Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel who shed a well needed shard of light on this otherwise terrible film. Nightbeast would have never shown up on set had he known the terrible movie making talent of this small Maryland town.',neg

'I first saw the trailer for Frailty on Yahoo Movies way back in the day after hearing Stephen King praise it to high heaven. Not really a fan of either star I still wanted to see it because Im a huge thriller fan.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. The acting was superb especially from the two young boys. Usually I loathe child actors but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton really did a good job of directing it too. It was beautifully shot.<br /><br />One must also note the plot twists. The three twists at the end hit hard and fast and I didnt see them coming. The final twist of the film coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed gives me chills to this day even though Ive re-watched the film so many times.<br /><br />A true gem.',pos
'Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood. The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. The event sequence complicates following Following. If you are willing to pay attention it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks. With the running time at 70 minutes there is a lot to take in but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled.<br /><br />Bill is a lonely untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go-what they do. He is a bit too conspicuous however and eventually gets caught by a well dressed clean-cut bloke named Cobb. Cobb entangles Bill in a world the poor boy is not prepared to live in. Cobb is a smart rogue who seems to have complete control over the other characters. By the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly. The film is an excellent first effort from the talented Christoper Nolan who would go on to make Memento one of the most original movies of our time.',pos
'The movie opens with a flashback to Doddsville County High School on April Fools Day. A group of students play a prank on class nerd Marty. When they are punished for playing said prank they follow up with a bigger prank which (par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds) goes ridiculously awry leaving Marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough. Fast forward five years where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion. We find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious jester mask-clad murderer in increasingly complicated and mind-numbingly ludicrous fashions. It doesnt take Sherlock Holmes to solve the mystery of the killers identity as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred Marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario. The film takes a turn for the bizarre as Marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors only to be haunted by their ghosts. Marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life. Finally the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as Marty wakes up in a hospital bed breaks free of his restraints stabs a nurse and finally disfigures his own face.<br /><br />The script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic. The only originality comes from the mind-numbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched. The absurd it-was-all-a-dream ending feels tacked on. Its almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dream.<br /><br />Technically speaking the film is atrocious. Some scenes were filmed so dark that I had to pause the film and play with the color on my television. The acting is sub-par even for slasher films. I cant help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable. Their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them cant bother to keep their accents straight through the movie.<br /><br />All of this being said if you like bad horror movies you might like this one too. It isnt the worst film of the genre but its far from the best.',neg
'I love Seth Green. His appearances on THat 70s Show is always worth watching but last night I felt the show needed to overhauled. Four single young guys inherit a New York City apartment that most of us would die for. The grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place. So I felt the need for realism should have been brought out. Anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable. I would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the shows set up. There did not seem to be much humor in it. I am only watching it because it falls before My Name is Earl on a winning Thursday night. I think they should go back scrap this series and start over. We need more family involved series. How about Seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down. THey could have Dabney Coleman play the father and Christine Estabrook play the mother and dysfunctional siblings. The list of possibilities with somebody like Seth Green are endless and the network is blowing it.',neg
'It seems that no matter how many films are made on the subject there is no shortage of stories that emerge from the Second World War. It stands to reason that a conflict on such a scale as global warfare would capture the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with ample material on which to base a story. Heading in a different direction than most mainstream movies about the war is Dark Blue World a film that does not deal with the traditional major battles of the war does not tell the story of many of its major figures and does not even focus on soldiers of any of the major allied or axis powers. Dark Blue World instead ventures into the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied nations.<br /><br />The film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges faced by Czech pilots flying under the British Royal Air Force expressing the frustration that they felt both at the language barrier between them and the other fliers but also at being restrained from achieving vengeance against the Germans until being re-trained.<br /><br />Dark Blue World also works quite well outside the arena of the war film as being a story about human relationships. A love triangle develops between the two main characters and an English woman that complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers. This relationship is extremely well acted throughout developing into almost a father and son relationship at many points.<br /><br />The aerial combat in the film is among some of the best and is also very interesting in exploring the cultural challenges mentioned above as the men struggle to fly their machines fight the enemy and relay commands and replies in an unfamiliar language. The tension and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground just as the tension on the ground continues that felt in the air.<br /><br />This may not be a film for everyone. The hardcore war film buff may find its exploration of relationships a bit off-putting but it is on the whole an excellent film regardless of the bellicose element or not.',pos
'Proof if ever proof were needed that Hammer should have left their vampires firmly in the Victorian age. After all vampirism is all about repressed sexuality so the concept is irrelevant in 1972s London with its thirty-something thesps pretending to be randy teenagers.<br /><br />Remember by this time Hammer was floundering badly. The public had tired of the drawing room horror of the 1950s and 60s so the studio was trying everything to bring them back including ample nudity (LUST FOR A VAMPIRE et al) and updating their characters - neither of which apparently worked as Hammer was pretty much resting in it grave just two years later. Shame ...<br /><br />But I still have a great fondness for the classic Hammer period from 1957-1965.',neg

'This is probably the best movie of 2002 regarding Romanian cinema. I do recommend it being an intense drama with no lack of action and thrills. The movie concentrates upon teen life in the Bucharest suburbs trough the main character not focusing so much on the characters shape or definition but more on the anger that he and other characters feel. The title Furia means rage rather than anger but could be regarded in the movie in both senses from the behavior of actors. The rather odd love story (not a typical romantic one but rather a modern suburban conception) is well shaped towards the end. It is a captivating picture and cinematography is pretty good in catching the suburban night life thus making it a nice movie to watch and.<br /><br />You wont get bored for a minute i promise!',pos

'This movie is simply incredible! I had expected something quite different form the film that I actually saw. However it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior. Let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high-brow sort of pornography. It even features a scene that comes extremely close to rape.<br /><br />Meanwhile I strongly suggest seeing this rare work of sexual art. Every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies by the way. One should not forget how times have changed!<br /><br />Go see it! It´s worth your money and time!',pos
'Made in 1931 this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often.<br /><br />We open on a quiet little French village scanning the roofs of the sleeping citizens.

In fact H.E. double hockey sticks no! is the way he acts about it.<br /><br />So when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost through no fault of his own he is frantic. Everyone is out for themselves looking for this ticket in something like a precursor to The Great Race.

'Ardh Satya is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various Police officers & colleagues the film describes the story of Anand Velankar a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his fathers ideologies & incidences of his fathers Atrocities on his mother. Anands approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anands constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shettys house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes the film has Hair-raising moments.<br /><br />The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism Corruption Political Influence Courage Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally the films belongs to the One man show Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.',pos
'First off I hadnt seen The Blob since I was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience. Pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today. And even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s fear of teenagers. But this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be.<br /><br />Sure it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world. But The Blob packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults dont believe them. In fact there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy-colored world. And Steve McQueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him.<br /><br />To sum up if you can take off your postmodern irony filter theres a lot more to love here than meets the eye.',pos
'Are you a giraffe?... ask John to Nadia and she sure of responding well responds him: yes. In this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who dont know each other and at the same time the questions and doubts in Birthday Girl.

Birthday Girl is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet. The woman that he finds comes from Russia. She seems to be that delicate woman normal not more. One day in her birthday comes suddenly his cousin and his friend. The man begin to discover certain things. Since here he dont going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been.<br /><br />Much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot. Much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and dont novel. But Birthday Girl is just the opposite. This movie is full of good surprises good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind. Birthday Girl have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes but at the same time certain touching nature and makes it so deeper.<br /><br />Birthday Girl is sometimes sad sometimes funny sometimes violent but at the end is totally satisfactory.

'This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film. I have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant--while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only movie I know of that has such polarized views based on gender. Perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots--but whatever the cause I have always found this difference fascinating.<br /><br />The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future and the head of the huge international Soylent Corporation has been assassinated. As the film unfolds you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future American society. The rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy(including furniture--a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment). At the same time the masses are dirt poor unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways. Overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed! <br /><br />Why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with I really should NOT discuss--it could ruin the film for you. However the film has a great plot and acting and is super-exciting to watch. Plus it features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston. Though not for the easily depressed or squeamish this is a great sci-fi film that is allegorical and profound.',pos
'Im going to write about this movie and about Irreversible (the (in)famous scene in it). So you are warned if you havent seen the movie yet. This are just my thoughts why I think the movie fails (in the end - pun intended).<br /><br />Acting wise Rosario Dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger (a teenager in other words). The villain guy is good but loses his evil touch right before the end. If he really never changes then why would he let a woman tie him up? He wouldnt period. Then we also have the bartender/2nd rape Dude. Actually I dont think you would need him. At least not for the 2nd rape but more about that later on.<br /><br />Lets reprise the story. Rosarios character is sexually insecure might even have lesbian tendencies (see her scene with a female friend). This wasnt intentional as Rosario states herself but there is sexual tension between them. Rosarios character meets a guy who is a sexual Predator in all the bad senses. But he makes an impression on her.<br /><br />Rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before. I beg to differ. Because she acts as if it is her first boyfriend which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother. Talking about her mother heres another problem. After the first rape takes place Rosarios character doesnt tell anyone what happened. Seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one nothing of that gets explored after that. If Rosarios character wouldnt call her mother anymore or would behave strangely the mother would be worried like crazy. There was so much potential here. Also her female friend: We see her at the party its obvious there is something going on and boom she is gone.<br /><br />The first rape is almost unbearable to watch. But feels like a pinch when you compare it to the ending (rape) which feels like youre getting hit with a sledge hammer! After rape no. 1 we get too stretched out scenes. Threads are opened (such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian as one guy states who tried to hit on her ...) but left in the open. No real social contact is established if you leave the bartender guy out who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene. Its apparent that he isnt a nice guy and his character gets fleshed out a bit. But when Rosarios character meets her rapist in class again his being in the movie seems pointless. We get the point that Rosarios character isnt the same anymore that she went bad and is able to hurt people. (Too) Many scenes show exactly that her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff. Back to Rapist #1 who cheats on a test gets caught by Rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again (really?). As absurd as that sounds the guy meets up with her not without us having seen him beforehand with another girl (very likely that he raped her too although we never see anything of that fortunately) and his football career. Well career is a stretch and he is bullied. This is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works but then again is too cliché to stay with you. So Rapist #1 submits to Rosarios character ... why exactly? Because he promised her it was her day? Again really? A guy like that never loses control especially with a woman he raped before ... I guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is. The bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something but letting him submit like that just feels wrong. Another possibility would have a drug in his drink.<br /><br />So rapist #1 undresses and gets blindfolded and lets Rosarios character tie him on a bed .... seriously thats just crazy! But what comes next is even crazier. First she talks to him then she shuts him up and forces an object into him. This is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one. This isnt about what this guy deserves or not its just intense. And of course that was what they were aiming for. Now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes ... rapist #1. If this really should work as a revenge movie it would have been better if Rosarios character herself would have been doing all the revenge. Having a henchman doing the job takes away everything that was built up.<br /><br />This isnt supposed to be entertaining/enjoyable its a hard watch & it is Art-house. But the 10 minute (I didnt count ) rape scene at the end just smashes everything. Rosarios character is more or less only watching what happens. Which brings me to the biggest disappointment.<br /><br />Irreversible comparison: Irreversible had the rape scene but the movie went on (even if it was back into time). Rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this. First that comes a bit too late that should see her say that after the initial rape. And secondly and most importantly this is where the Art-house movie shouldve come in. It is more interesting seeing were Rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope with what she had done. But then again she didnt actually physically do that much (see above) ... a broken character that the movie cuts off ...<br /><br />Good intentions (Talia and Rosario had worked before) but failing to convey most of the things they set out to do (even if you can see what they meant it has to be convincing otherwise it doesnt work) ... not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are ...',neg
'I really thought this would be a good movie boy...was I mistaken! For a quick summery: B grade acting C grade special effects D grade for the overall movie. Dont get me wrong the story was pretty good and not kiddish so an adult too ride along with it the hero is good looking so most women will like it :-) not a total chick flick as it contains some fight scenes and some blood<br /><br />but the way it is shot... horrible <br /><br />the special effects->would be better suited for TV->on a kids show <br /><br />and lastly...send some of the actors back to acting school if they ever attended a class there.<br /><br />Trust me there are much better ways to waste 2 hours.<br /><br />You have been warned.',neg
'This movie is exactly the same as Ridley Scotts Someone To Watch Over Me which is a classic. It stars Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers and the bad guy from the Fugitive. Its a quality movie with good direction and great acting. This movie is the polar opposite. Its the same plot just minus any good acting and adding TV movie direction. I do have to say I like the interaction between Lowe and the woman. Shes hot and their romance is believable on many levels. Unfortunately that alone cannot save this carbon copy of the classic Ridley Scott film.<br /><br />Usually crappy TV movies have some redeeming quality that makes them watchable at the very least. I think for me this films redeeming value is that Rob Lowe and the lead female have chemistry. That and I was able to watch and compare the plot to another quality film.',neg
'Shaggy friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message: if you want to make it in this world being imaginative isnt enough you have to live up to your place in society and that means living by the (heterosexual) rules that govern us. Drag queen comedy-drama from Australia is a mostly upbeat journey of three male friends traveling across the Outback in their pink bus christened Priscilla. While not a formula film per se there are the obligatory road movie sequences (bonding by the bonfire facing down the rednecks etc.). Writer-director Stephan Elliott follows every potentially mean-spirited moment with a little humor and sympathy but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative a dire subplot about a gay mans relationship with his ex-wife and estranged pre-teen son (both of whom are comfortable--and the child wise--with his lifestyle) and a third act with no energy whatsoever. It has some wicked transvestite humor and a fairly game cast but a script that seems to have been watered down along the way. ** from ***',neg
'I havent laughed this hard since granny got caught in the wringer says one of the potheads in this hilarious quasi-spoof of all those Val Lewton and George A. Romero walking-dead movies we have come to love (or loath depending on your personal taste) through the years. <br /><br />In this story a young actor pair play a ghoulish prank on the rest of their troupe after one spooky night they visit a cemetery island. Their artistic director Alan pretends to bring the dead back to life by conducting a highly stylized ritual.<br /><br />Way too much screen time is misspent; the amateur dialog includes lame witticisms melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary filler commentaries (And cant Alan stop that irritating laughter... way too much!). Once the action kicks in (which comes close to the end of this film) its worth the wait. <br /><br />I saw this one on a late-night local station television program that ran films very much like this one... only this one scared me at the age of 13... but then again you might laugh your way through it until the bitter end... ...which is probably the reason nowadays why very few people still wear striped hip-huggers.',neg
'**SPOILERS** With the title of the film having the name of the killer fish twice not once you would expect to see them in action attack biting ripping and eating up almost everyone in the cast of characters. Instead you have to wait until the movie is almost over for you to get as much as a glimpse of the Piranahs. Even then all you see is the water bubbling and stirring around as a poor individual disappears under it assuming that hes being eaten whole and alive by the fish.<br /><br />The movie Piranha Piranha starts with this scary looking Piranha on the screen as the credits start rolling down but****SPOILER****thats the only time in the movie that you ever get to see the killer fish or fishes you never get to see a Piranha is the movie again. What you do see is a travelogue of Venezuela and its people and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon River basin. Together with a lot of nice and breathtaking photography of the landscape as well as the people and wildlife but thats about all.<br /><br />There is some kind of a story that has to do with this great White Hunter Caribe William Smith which ironically means Piranha in the native language spoken there is this what the title of the film Piranha Piranha really meant? Caribe Caribe! The person Caribe is played by legendary Hollywood Hells Angles biker and all around tough guy William Smith.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie this trio of American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry Peter Bown & Ahna Capri and their American guide Art Green Tom Simcox are on their way into the Venezuelan jungles to go sight-seeing with Terry taking photos to send back home. Terry is terrified of guns as we learn that as a young girl saw her father get his head blown off by a gun. Even when Art saves her life using one when sees attack by a six foot long diamondback rattlesnake Terry almost belts him for having a gun; which he promised her he wouldnt take along with him on the trip.<br /><br />At a jungle rest stop or bar the three run into Caribe who we first saw catching monkeys in the jungle at the start of the movie. Caribe makes himself more then welcomed by the three with his knowledge of the jungle and his half-baked philosophy about life and death as well as his ability to get them where their going to the local diamond mines deep in the Amazon basin.<br /><br />Even though a bit strange at first the guy is so in to himself that he doesnt seem to notice that there are any people around him Caribe turns out to be a swell and likable guy engaging in a long and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and jungle with Art. Caribe even shows Terry who at one time in the movie almost knocked his teeth out the fine points of hunting and shooting wild game that he believes dont really die but become a part of him after he kills them! A bit crazy but you have to admit this guys got imagination. <br /><br />Its much later in the movie that for some strange reason maybe it was the cheap booze that he was drinking Caribe suddenly goes insane and become homicidal attacking and raping Terry and then murdering her enraged brother and feeding him to the deadly Piranhas. Trying to escape from the rampaging lunatic and then being forced to have to fight it out with him Art gets beaten up so savagely by the dirty-fighting Caribe that hes almost left unconscious. Just when Caribes about to finally kill Art hes shot to death by Terry who after experiencing what this insane nut-job is all about finally decided that guns are indeed very necessary and should be used to kill on very rare but life-saving occasions.<br /><br />Worth watching if worth watching at all only for the scenery and nothing else. Its just a shame that the movie has to advertise as a killer fish or Piranha horror movie when if it was honest about itself it could have been a more or less average jungle adventure flick with Smith he does have the build for it playing Tarzan of the Venezuelan not African Jungle',neg
'Oh man is this movie bad. It flows horribly. The story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this doesnt love himself. He tries getting out of the contract and horrible painfully unfunny gags ensue. Jim Nabors seems as if hes sleepwalking not acting. Youll miss such Burt sidekicks as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinker. Loni Andersons hair is downright scary proving that tons of hairspray didnt go out in the sixties. Or maybe that was a wig. Speaking of Burts wig wasnt bad in this film. His worst wig day was in Smokey and the Bandit 2. Anyhow this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie ever ever right up there with Cannonball Run 2. The original Smokey and Cannonball (and Hooper which thankfully had no sequel) are great funny films. This one isnt. Even Ned Beatty who is a great actor stinks. Youll long for a Jackie Gleason type villain who is fun to hate. And mind you this isnt one of those fun movies to bag on. Its lousy pure and simple. Even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring and worst of all unfunny. And least I forget Stroker Ace was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burts coffin before his somewhat-revival years later in Boogie Nights another film that like Deliverance years earlier shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so.',neg
'This movie is one of the best ever produced by disney.<br /><br />The plot is very original and entertaining. The animated sequence is also very well done with the live actors.

'I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It is great! When Jim tosses that little person through the window the look on his face is priceless. Then when he starts to address the Priest in his wifes behalf only to find out that she has become the Pee-Woman? Great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see. I am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode. Id like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as the Greenman? Can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo?',neg
'This great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a DVD along with Prelude to War. The great American filmmaker and story teller Frank Capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused World War II and Hitlers rise.<br /><br />Every school child nay every American should watch these films today because they are so apropos. History has been repeating itself over and over again! The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the Nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups are still working to these evil groups advantage.<br /><br />By sitting back and letting Hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive - France America and England caused over 50 million peoples deaths. Americans French and British today would happily let Hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties.<br /><br />These great films may be too simplistic for World War II history buffs. They dont tell the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because at the time America was teamed up with them fighting Hitler. This film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war.',pos
'Hey this Ralf Westhoff seems to knows a lot about people! We have nine women and nine men taking part in a speed dating event each person has five minutes to talk to each opposite. A good idea to make a movie out of these conversations. And even better: it works very very well! The dialog is witty original and authentic each person is subtly characterized without falling into the cliché trap something that is unusual for German movies remember: All these years we Germans were tormented with silly zeitgeist comedies such as Workaholic or Stadtgespräch.<br /><br />But now the time has come for young German directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing movies which are entertaining and funny AND intelligent and sensitive at the same time. The timing of Shoppen is good too: Although it presents mainly dialog it keeps the tension and interest. After a while you actually become curious to see how this man and that woman would do. Some of the participants meet later on for a two-some its fun to see them interacting together in real life. Of course the film has a few drawbacks: its not very cinematic (but can such a movie be?) the musical soundtrack could have been better but all this is only marginal.<br /><br />The most important thing about this movie: We have some damn good actors here. Imagine this: All of them are still pretty unknown even here in Germany (most were derived from the Munich or Bavarian theater scene). But I predict that out of the 18 main actors at least 11 will quickly become very well-known in the movie and TV scene over here. Its great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces. Well-done!<br /><br />For those who want to read more heres a rundown of all 18 actors:(spoilers!)<br /><br />Sebastian Weber: Silent waters are deep! Memorize his Flower garden monologue you can win any womans heart with this one.<br /><br />Anna Böger: A hell of a woman! Every time she opens her mouth you cant help but laugh and feel good. Listen how she pronounces asshole and calls the pink shirt guy a Bürscherl!<br /><br />Felix Hellmann: The Bürscherl from above is fun to watch. The inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around. His looks somewhat reminded me of Flo Weber of Sportfreunde Stiller.<br /><br />Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love hope despair beauty. Her do you want children scene is a classic. A great actress of whom we will hear again no doubt.<br /><br />David Baalcke: Now is this guy a loser or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in Sideways. I hope this is NOT method acting.<br /><br />Julia Koschitz: The good looking woman in the circle. Julia used to play theater in my hometown kudos! I think she will appear in many TV series to come.<br /><br />Martin Butzke: The revolutionary guy catches the cutest and most conventional woman in the end. Would you like to share a taxi with this guy?<br /><br />Kathrin von Steinburg: She gave a stunning performance in Tatort last year. Her trance-like performance in this movie is no less. SEE her beautiful face and HEAR her dirty laugh. The best scene in the movie belongs to her. <br /><br />Matthias Bundschuh: I know these write down everything-guys back from school. Im not sure whether the hot blond got her allergic reaction because of him or his cat. Matthias portrayal of such a chicken is outstanding. <br /><br />Mediha Cetin: The sister-in-law of my ex-girl-friend was the same talker like her. The day I met her was the only day in my life I needed tranquilizers so bad remembrances here.<br /><br />Thomas Limpinsel: The nice and desperate guy in the circle. Limpinsel has a comical talent that is way better than most so-called comedians on TV.<br /><br />Lisa Wagner: The victim of Sebastians flower garden metaphor. Lisas face is funny and full of melancholy her story made me feel good and sad at the same time wow!<br /><br />Oliver Bürgin: The good looking man in the circle. No wonder he catches Julia in the end. These two really fit together. I think he will appear in many TV series to come.<br /><br />Julia Heinze: The cute conventional woman. I hope she wont be underrated: Julias face changes from naive to hurt to furious are great! <br /><br />Stephan Zinner: The nature boy from Partenkirchen likes cooking eating  and good sex. Watch the body language between him and the hot blond! Zinner usually plays CSU politician Söder on stage!<br /><br />Anja Klawun: The bargain girl has some good moments but beg your pardon fails (like most actors) in playing a drunk on screen.<br /><br />Christian Pfeil: Plays the arrogant and narcissistic guy. Couldnt believe that this very actor owns two art-house cinemas in Munich. <br /><br />Tanja Schleiff: Plays the girl who sleeps with every man around. Im sure many male visitors will go for her. I have heard she can do dramatic roles as well so Im curious.',pos
'Cult purchasers are unquestionably familiar with the term video nasties. This was a notorious British list containing all the films that could bring damage to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences (dramatization). For gore buffs this is an excellent checklist as it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbingly realist movies (Faces of Death Cannibal Holocaust Driller Killer) as well as outrageous and ultra-sick horror films (The Burning Nightmare City The Toolbox Murders). Keeping this in mind its quite unusual to see Night of the Bloody Apes listed among the other nasties. It sure is gorybut the blood and violence are so poorly presented I cant imagine anyone would be offended by it. And the silly plot (about a desperate doctor transplanting a gorillas heart into the chest of his dying son) isnt exactly what you would call disturbingly real neither. All that remains is a fairly amusing pulp-horror flick with awful acting and pointless sleaze. The man-ape make up effects are laughable and theres no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere. Enjoyable only if youre in the right mood in other words. The few sequences showing detailed matches of lady-wrestling (which one of the lead-actresses does for a living) are very cool.',neg
'This is a movie that I watched when I was a young girl and never forgot. It is certainly not the best movie ever made but there is something very special about it that I cant quite put my finger on. I LOVE it. I am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me though and for that reason alone this movie drives me crazy. <br /><br />Exactly what/Who is that mysterious witch-lady and what is her relationship with Tom? WHY and HOW did he become a Water Baby ... why was he raised on the earth? It is questions like these that are just eating at me! I thought if I read the book I would get answers but I just read an article that the book from which this story is based is a lot different. So I guess Ill never know what the writer was thinking! <br /><br />I still love this movie though and I recently watched it with my two year old niece. She loves it too although she insists on calling it Baby Water for reasons unknown to me. She loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares Im all clean. (You have to understand that my niece is the cleanest 2 year old in the world!) We watched that scene over and over. <br /><br />I am so glad that we can enjoy this film together! There should be more films like this. (But what is up with the gay seahorse??!!)',pos
'I channel surfed past this many times mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy so Love American Style. However it turned out to be quite good very well done. The two stand-out features are the dialog and acting. Great cast. The premise is actually well executed and there arent too many weak moments. I guess what I was most amazed by was how often you thought the wheels are going to come off the cart and instead the cart just banks the turns so to speak and the movie keeps flying. There are some nice little sub-plots particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by former Conan sidekick Andy Richter. Also want to mention that the music accompanying it was good.',pos
'As a single woman over 40 I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40 not to mention every other woman of any age. It was a sad pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a chick flick and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell isnt much of an actress to begin with but given the non-existent plot (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this she didnt have a chance. There was no character development no reason to feel sympathy/empathy for any of the characters and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. And then theres the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- PLEASE.<br /><br />Not only do I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripoff.',neg
'This movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that I have ever seen. I am not a religious person but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience. One suddenly realizes that there is really meaning to life.<br /><br />I must admit that when I first heard about this movie I was sceptical. I thought the plot sounded contrived and I was afraid that the story would be banal. But being a David Lynch fan I decided to give it a go. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie but then I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the cinema feeling that I had truly learned something valuable about life.<br /><br />This is not a typical David Lynch movie and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand I am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight because I also thought he managed that very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and I think The Straight Story is his best yet. 9.5/10',pos
'Kar Wai Wongs incredibly impressive romance that is to me perfect. Set in 1960s Hong Kong. As we are shown this is set in a turbulent time. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan. A man and a woman who meet each other in a Hong Kong apartment in which they both move in. Chow Mo-wan works for a newspaper company. Su Li-zhen Chan is a secretary. Two very different people. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan create a special bond after they both find out their spouses constantly away are committing extra-marital trysts. With each other.<br /><br />The characters of Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan are nothing short of amazing. Both Leung and Cheung manage to strike such amazing chemistry with one another its better than any Hollywood romance that is put out today. Combined. The film is all about the focus of the two leads and their feelings after the infidelities of their partners. Kar Wai Wong manages to create such strong character development between these two characters you really start to feel for them. Leung and Cheung are both wildly amazing are better than any Hollywood pairing shown on the screen today. Combined.<br /><br />Theres nothing much else to describe Fa yeung nin wa other than beautiful energetic romance that also features a moody atmospheric piece with gorgeous cinematography. So much elements of this movie help create it to be flawless. As well as Kar Wai Wong and the acting the cinematography from both Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee is haunting. Beautifully understated. The shots from Kar Wai Wong help makes your mind create a world of its own. A world that creates these characters. Original melancholic and nostalgic. This film is incredibly unforgettable.<br /><br />The costumes created by Kar Wai Wong regular William Chang are absolutely beautiful. Cheung who wears an elegant ankle-deep beautifully patterned dress in every scene. Shes a scene-stealer. Her costumes say a lot about her character and an emotion is fitted in all of her dresses colours which are vividly and smartly used. Highly original. Chang also the production designer creates a brilliant setting for the movies moody piece. Especially with the help of the marvellous music used in scenes and masterful film editing again by Chang. William Chang seems to be incredibly versatile and is an unsung hero for this movie.<br /><br />Overall this movie is one of the best from this millennium. Incredibly compelling and filled with nostalgia. The shots are mesmerising and haunting. Kar Wai Wong somewhat proves to be a master at the top of his game. The acting; music; cinematography; editing; production; costume and direction all help create ONE small little perfect film. A masterpiece in romance film-making. Visually spectacular. Overall a masterpiece to film-making. A film that reminds me of old classic Hollywood was the one that never was. Never forget Fa yeung nin wa. I know I wont.',pos
'I dont care what anyone says this movie was crap. The only thing it had going for it was camera work which was very well done. As for the dialogue I have heard so many people talk about...it sucked too. Yes it was honest and true to life but so what I can hear anyone talk like that on the street or in a fast food joint. What made the dialogue good in movies like Pulp Fiction and Gosford Park was the fact that it is WRITTEN dialogue that takes time to think through. Another thing was that the director should not have put himself in the picture. I believe that the male character could have been a lot stronger but instead it seemed weak. In fact the movie seemed to revolve around the male character and then he completely disappears in the last twenty minutes. The girl in the film I found completely repulsive not in appearance but in her needy needy ways. Saying she is in love with a guy and actually getting jealous of him the next day what a crock of crap. Final thing: the sound was terrible and I hope it was only something that plagued my theater instead of actually being on the final cut of the film. There was a constant buzzing sound during several scenes and it was actually taking away from the talking going on. The one good thing again was Bloods job as the DP but the actress that played the main guys ex girlfriend did a very good job as well. These two things couldnt save an ultimately terrible movie which I refuse to call a film.<br /><br /> 2/10',neg

Im sorry but I was lured in when I found out about Lil Bill OReilly (which I had no idea came from this show until months later and has honestly since lost its appeal) but I gave the show a fair shot. Spike tries to hard to make himself into something hes not which is to say he tries to be human. Fox didnt even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the box he came in. His sketches try to hard he himself isnt funny and the writers are struggling to write material for a no-talent host.

'Although it really isnt such a terribly movie (especially considering it was made directly for TV-distribution) itll be very difficult to point out one aspect in Bloodsuckers that is actually original or refreshing. Vampires in space isnt exactly a new formula and even after so many movies dealing with these monsters in this particular setting still no one seems to realize its an incredibly stupid premise that cant possibly result in a halfway decent horror movie. Bloodsuckers even goes one step further and shamelessly imitates every imaginable motion picture that either revolves on vampires and intergalactic warfare. The plot and characters are mainly stolen directly from John Carpenters Ghosts of Mars and James Camerons Aliens as a crew of futuristic vampire hunters are crusading through space and regularly holding to eliminate a mutated species that peculiarly named themselves after notorious horror icons like the Voorhees and the Leatherfaces. The good guys are a bunch of pathetic stereotypes constantly dealing with clichéd issues and endlessly arguing about dreadfully unimportant matters. Captain Damian is the unpopular rookie wholl really have to prove his leadership capabilities now after being more or less responsible for the death of the previous (and far more loved) Captain Churchill. The other annoying characters include a typical cowboy-style and trigger happy macho pilot a tough female warrior with more balls than any of the males on board (shes of Asian descent like the girl in Aliens was Latino) and the armys most valuable secret weapon: a Blade-girl! Quintana is a beautiful and deadly vampire who chose the side of humans. She can spot enemies when theyre still light-years away and she can also do wickedly sexy things with someones wet dreams. They eventually all learn to work as a team when forced to face the ultimate vampire-meanie: Michael Ironside (in yet another downgrading role). Bloodsuckers is an irredeemably stupid film but it manages to entertain as long as it features gory killings infantile dialogs and OTT make-up effects. It only gets intolerably boring when the frustrated soldiers blame the captain for the umpteenth time and bla bla bla. This film is a non-stop series of lame clichés and uncreative ideas but at least its watchable.',neg

'Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Cantonese / English subtitles<br /><br />Once upon a time five years ago the world was obsessed with The Matrix and I was perhaps one of the few fifteen year olds left who still believed that Terminator was better than Matrix. I was but a simple teenage boy looking for a good action movie and then there was a shining light on a TV station I had never really watched a little station known as SBS. One night I noticed in the TV guide that a movie starring Jackie Chan - Police Story would be on later. Being fifteen and having only seen Rumble in the Bronx and Rush Hour I said... WOW AWESOME and sat down to watch it and continually shouted WOW AWESOME as the movie progressed. Two weeks later after SBS had shown the Police Story trilogy I knew I had found my new favourite actor.<br /><br />Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui a Hong Kong cop who busts a major drug-lord Chu (Yuen Chor). Chus secretary Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin) is being held by the police as a witness against Chu and Chan is assigned to protect her. Things go bad - reaaaal bad - when Chus case is dismissed and he decides he wants Fong and Chan dead.<br /><br />Police Story is one of the greatest action movies ever and certainly one of my favourite Jackie Chan films. It starts off strong and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed. Everything in between is great. However some of the funny parts may seem a little tasteless to more than a few people...<br /><br />As a story this is still one of Jackies better efforts. For an action movie the story is pretty good and Jackie is a much better actor in this than he is in the acting & plot intensive New Police Story. This isnt Miracles but maybe thats a good thing.<br /><br />Police Story is one of Jackies finest works. It got me hooked on Jackie Chan movies and should provide a nice start for any potential Jackie fans. The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan movies dont come much better - 10/10',pos
'Although it has been 2 years I still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie. Unfortunately I came across this movie after my friends and I selected it while browsing through the new releases at Blockbuster. We decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable. Although it has been quite some time since I viewed the movie I still remember the lack of plot (seriously there is no true plot) and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie. If you are in the video store and this film catches your eye walk on and find a better movie. If you did end up seeing this movie I understand your pain :)',neg

How can you not be entertained by that infectious laugh and giggle and utter silliness. Although Im not really a Liza Minnelli fan she was really excellent as Linda Marolla and I couldnt picture anyone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his Oscar. The rest of the cast also excellent and that great tune Arthurs Theme wow. Truly this was one of the Best Comedies of the 1980s. Great films get better with each viewing and that is the case with Arthur.',pos
'Id give it a 2/10.<br /><br />I was really really disappointed.<br /><br />The storyline was poorly developed for instance the incidents were too short and brief hence the moral was not clearly brought out. I thought Brenda Song did a fine job but Shin Koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role. I could see the need to put in western elements in the show however there are certain parts where Chinese elements were needed too! The villain for example. His physical appearance resembled a robot instead of something out of the Chinese culture. The final and the worst flaw were the incorrect and distorted facts placed in the show.<br /><br />Others may point out that this is a Kids show and hence there is no need for the such high standards. However there are other Disney shows such as Mu Lan which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation.<br /><br />In conclusion I feel that Disney movies should be better researched and better planned. A good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on.',neg
'I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldnt do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.<br /><br />I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone. Rod serling coming in added to the scariness forest coming in lightened the mood. <br /><br />The ending whether good or bad made for a scary time. You could never predict what was going to happen. I am still trying to find the seasons on DVD.',pos
'I just saw this movie in a sneak preview and before reading my comment you have to know that it is very subjective because I love Techno Trance Club House and music like that.<br /><br />The movie deals with Carl whose brother Jason (or whatever his name was) died in an accident: he fell off a rooftop drunk. Carl meets his brothers girlfriend Sunny and the two of them quite unmotivated some kind of private investigation about Jasons death and Carl gets involved in Jasons ex-life that was filled with clubs and drugs. The movie itself seen from an artistic point of view is nothing more than a big pile of s**t. The plot is predictable all of the characters are extremely cliched and two-dimensional (stupid boy from a small town young good-looking innocent girl big bad drug king... the list is endless) and most of the acting such as the plot are just not credible. Matthew Rhys performance of the stupid boy coming to big London and sudden taking drugs from people he does not even know does not seem very credible unlike his female counterpart Sunny performed by Sienna Guillory whose behaviour seems more realistic to the spectator. Nothing more than a joke was Tim Currys performance of the drug king Damian: a phony caricature too eeeevil and just too ridiculous to be true.<br /><br />BUT: If you like club music (the club scenes such as the selected tracks are simply brilliant) if you enjoy a simple lovestory with a sweet girl like Sunny (yes I confess I lost my heart ;)... that makes my comment even more subjective I guess) with some (predictable) twists and turns you will definetely enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Anybody else: F.O.R.G.E.T.....I.T.!<br /><br />3 out of 10 (objective view)<br /><br />7 out of 10 (my personal view and also my final vote)',pos
'Red Rock West is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore. Its well paced well acted and doesnt leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage stars as Michael an unemployed Texas roughneck desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to Wyoming for potential employment. He is honest to a fault but always on the dark side of fate.<br /><br />After failing to obtain gainful employment Michael stumbles into the Red Rock bar where the owner Wayne (J.T.Walsh) mistakes him for a contract killer he summoned from Dallas hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle).<br /><br />Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adulterous Suzie. With no intent on following through Michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn Suzanne of her impending demise. He also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits.<br /><br />As fate would dictate Michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy. While leaving in a violent rainstorm he runs down Suzannes lover. Of course Michael being Michael he takes him to the local hospital where its discovered that hes also been shot.<br /><br />The sheriff is summoned and as luck would have it Wayne is also the local law. Michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real Lyle from Dallas played with murderous glee by the quirky Dennis Hopper. After discovering that theyre fellow marines Lyle insists that Michael join him for a drink at where else the Red Rock bar. There Wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and Lyle are in hot pursuit of Michael who falls willingly into Suzannes waiting arms.<br /><br />As the pace picks up we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are really wanted armed robbers on the lam for a multi million dollar theft. Getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of betrayals double crosses and murders.<br /><br />The film was very well cast. Nicolas Cage was typically low key Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability. The best performance was by the late J.T. Walsh who was menacing without appearing to be. Walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon.<br /><br />Marc Reshoskys photography utilized many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development. The film was further enhanced by John Dahls tight directorial style and Morris Chestnuts rapid fire editing.',pos
'This is a movie that deserves another look--if you havent seen it for a while or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play by the same name it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring Shakespearean repertory company in England during World War II. It deals with his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young able bodied ones being taken for military service. It also deals with his relationship with various members of his company especially with his dresser. So far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth. While tragic overall the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout. The two male leads both received Oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama theater--especially Shakespeare or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity. The backstage goings-on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers.',pos
'At the time My Left Foot was the little movie that could. It was hugely popular and everyone applauded the fact that such a small independent film could make it all the way to the Oscars.<br /><br />Since then movies like My Left Foot are a dime a dozen so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about. Its certainly a well made and competent film but its clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of Daniel Day-Lewis who immerses himself in the role of Cristy Brown a man living with cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won Dustin Hoffman an Oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in Rain Man and the Academy followed suit by giving Day-Lewis the same honor.<br /><br />The only thing really separating this film from a big budget Hollywood production is just that -- its budget. In every other way its just as formulaic as any standard product. Thats not to say it isnt a good movie but its not a masterpiece.<br /><br />Grade: A-',pos
'Many other viewers are saying that this is not a good movie to watch since they feel that it isnt realistic. How can it not be considered realistic. They feel that say the incest part isnt easy to relate to that it isnt common. i can guarantee you that you have met more people than you think that have had an incest act occur. Many of them arent going to come out and say it and mostly these are victims. Also many people are Gay and are still in the closest because no matter how much they would like it to be they know they will be ridiculed and possibly even abandoned. And tell me how many kids have you went to high school with that has ended up being pregnant or had an eating disorder? i bet a lot and although pregnancy isnt from incest most of the time its still easy to relate to. Who cant relate to being an outcast or being bullied? that happens all the time. and many viewers are probably concerned with there education such as Marcus. being a stoner seems to be quite common these days to. so there are a lot of things to relate to. More than the rest though no matter how popular you may get sometimes you feel invisible or alone not noticed or overlooked such as the suicide victim how can you not feel like you can relate to the movie? I find that the movie may have seemed pointless to others but i would like to think of it as important. It an interesting way of showing that suicide happens and to be aware. it comes from the people that dont show their unhappy thoughts its very surprising. The people who show there problems do commit suicide sometimes to but when you hear of suicide who would have guessed is usually running through most peoples minds.<br /><br />The ending surprised me i wasnt expecting it to be the girl that until the end was mostly an extra in the scenes not even introduced. the story even in its description says its about 6 teenage lives when in fact it was 7. My only real disappointment was that it wasnt one of the characters that we got to learn about it merely at first seems like the movie was pointless to watch if the real victim is just some random chick. until i thought more. it made perfect sense for being a huge surprise since thats what suicides are like. plus who was to choose who any of the other students had more of a reason than the other.<br /><br />though this movie has some bad points most movies have a few but i would recommend this movie as long as you can deal with watching the tragic moments of watching the suicide and violence and profanity shown in this film.',pos

'This should not have been made into a movie. Everything about it was idiotic and I dont think I laughed even once. There were bits and pieces that were okay I guess but thats about it. A lot of parts were strikingly similar to a lot of other movies which did them a hell of a lot better. There were some famous actors/actresses in this but no one did a good job they mustve just not cared. This is one of those movies that tries to have a cute ending but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeeming values. Carrot Top is probably the worst comedian out there right now. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one!<br /><br />Final Decisions:<br /><br />Movies : NOOOOO!<br /><br />Purchase DVD : Absolutely not!<br /><br />Rental : Only if youve seen EVERYTHING else and have a free coupon but even then its still not worth your while.',neg
'For the sake of propaganda during World War II Sherlock Holmes was moved into the then-present. One of the results is Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon starring a top Holmes Basil Rathbone along with Nigel Bruce Lionel Atwill Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne. It is Holmes assignment to deliver a scientist Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) and his weapon design to the British government before the Germans can get him. Once the man reaches England however his troubles are just beginning. Can Holmes decode the message Dr. Tobel left before falling into the hands of the vicious Moriarity save the weapon and possibly the scientist too? This is an effective Holmes story set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and blackout England. The series worked just fine in the present day. It was not without its problems but those problems had nothing to do with the time period. Whose idea was it to make Watson an idiot? Nigel Bruces characterization - aided and abetted by the scripts - has always been the false note. I much prefer the characterization of Edward Hardwicke in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series - there hes attractive intelligent and a believable companion for Holmes. In the Rathbone series Holmes is often condescending and treats Watson like the bumbling fool that he is. However in this particular film Watson has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts.<br /><br />I admit to being a complete sap for Rathbones recitation from Richard II - ...this blessed plot this earth this England - I cant imagine how much it meant to the Brits watching the film in 1942. Sherlock Holmes really served his purpose.',pos
'Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks.

'This movie came and went in the theaters. Due to the nature of it you can see why it wasnt well received. It was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself. Higher Learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in America: racism.<br /><br />Plot/Story: Higher Learning is mostly centered around Malik(played by Omar Epps) a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough and a stern professor(played by Laurence Fishburne). He befriends Fudge(Ice Cube) as well as a gorgeous lady named Deja(Tyra Banks). Later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus. Remy(play by Michael Rapaport) is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus. Once they impose their views on him he becomes as racist as they are.<br /><br />Opinion: Higher Learning is not without its flaws: Character development is scarce okay performances by Omar Epps Tyra Banks and the leader of the skinheads(whose name I forgot) Busta Rhymes doesnt fit in this movie at all. Plus women turning gay after being abused by men was cliché before this film so you know I didnt like that part of the film with Kristy Swanson. Other than that this movie wasnt half bad. Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor Phipps(even though I could do without the accent) Fudge was Ice Cubes best performance and Michael Rapaport was good as the confused Remy. All in all it was one of John Singletons best movies and is one is one of the reasons I frown on the rubbish he puts out now. Cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning Mississippi Burning and American History X and less movies like Baby Boy 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very pointless remake of Shaft.',pos
'I very much enjoyed The Revolution Will Not Be Televised. It gave me once again a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they wish to be governed.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that in Venezuela the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all of the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades if not centuries. However when their coup failed; after the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court and The Constitution and the Ombudsman and the Electoral Boards and all Civil Rights no one took the plotters out behind a barn somewhere and shot them. They havent even gone to jail. The major plotters are living in Florida carrying on. And the protection that they had was the Bolivarian Constitution passed by a large majority of the Venezuelan People. It is not only History that Bites. Democracy can give you one hell of a nip if you let it loose. And in Venezuela it is loose.',pos

'This is without a doubt one of the most accomplished debut films for any director. The Movie is only 90 minutes long but manages to say just about everything about life and death. Not much action and dialogue is minimal but the movie flows perfectly and demands your attention due to the wonderfully natural feel of everything going on. The performances by the leads are perfection and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes. The movie will be somewhat lost on todays modern audience but this is one that everyone ought to see.Refreshingly unsentimental and honest this is on par with Ozus works. <br /><br />Scratch my title this one is perfect!',pos
'Recently released on British DVD this is a good movie (as long as you have an attention span and IQ of more than a fruit fly). Not as depressing as it could have been this is kitchen-sink at its most dirty. Terrance Stamp is great in it the music is sweet Carol White is very believeable as the single mum tart who cant stop loving criminals.<br /><br />My favourite scene is where Carol and her friend who works in the pub with her (the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye) sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk past.<br /><br />The only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of Carols first husband but if you can get past that youre OK. And Donovan provides some of the most languid mellow bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s.',pos
'I think if you are into the sixties kind of thing as I am you are obligated to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck. The saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early (and embarrassing) footage. Its as if the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full length film covering all the high points (and more) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a $10000 budget to complete it. Hardly a classic but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was the silliness the over-idealism and the uptightness of the establishment. Clearly not for everyone.',neg

'As a rule a Full Moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a film. But because Ive enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films I gave it a shot.<br /><br />Its not bad. Not great but thats something else. The film involves a struggle with a mystic (evil) brother who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character. Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people and authorities in the mundane world which he does successfully.<br /><br />Possible spoilers follow.<br /><br />Dr. Mordrid can travel between dimensions and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress; however the guard has been blinded. His eyes are ruined pits. So the wizard passes his hands across the others eyes and hey presto! His eyes have been restored! This sort of healing apparently only works with eyes.<br /><br />Later Mordred and his brother animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight. Guess which one wins.<br /><br />However side from that the picture isnt at all bad though much like a comic book. Dr. Mordreds more human adventures are okay and Combs plays the role convincingly.<br /><br />Ive seen lots worse.',pos

'Loosely based on actual events Rivers Edge is a film much in the style of David Lynch about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends but no one does anything about it for a long time. With top notch acting by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper we are able to forgive the average acting by everyone else in the film.<br /><br />The film begins with a young boy Tim (Joshua John Miller) dropping a doll off of a bridge (murder #1). Tim then hears someone yelling when he looks up he sees Samson (Daniel Roebuck) standing on the bank of the river with the dead naked body of his girlfriend behind him (murder #2). Samson eventually shows the body to his friends. All of which are horrified not only because of the murder but also because the victim Jamie (Danyi Deats) was a friend of theirs. Despite all of this no one goes to the police. You may think this is unrealistic but this is what happened in the real story. If you are familiar with the story of Alpha Dog (2006) you will know that the same thing happened there as well. Through all of this Layne (Crispin Glover) is working to keep Samson safe although no one (including Samson) seems to care about keeping him out of harms way. As time goes on we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper) a middle aged shut in who deals drugs to the local teenagers has also killed a woman before (murder #3). From here things begin to close in on Samson and his friends and eventually everything is revealed but not in the way you may be expecting.<br /><br />In the film we learn of three murders each one with a different reason a different reaction and a different effect on those involved. When Tim drops his younger sisters doll off of the bridge we are never made aware of his motive. However we do see the reaction of the younger sister. She cries and screams while her mother consoles her. Later her older brother Matt (Keanu Reeves) helps her put a cross in the yard in remembrance of her doll. The murder of Jamie horrifies everyone (except Samson who is apathetic to the whole situation and when asked by Layne why he did it Samson replies with She was talking sh*t.) but they do not sob or scream the run away and go on with their lives trying to forget what had happened. In Fecks situation he did not kill his girlfriend out of hate. We never really know why he killed her but we see that Feck is not proud of what he had done. He even mentions that he is sorry and that her loved her. From this we see the different ways we can be affected by death. In the film it is easy for us to identify with the teenagers because they do not know what they feel or how they should feel about the death of their friend. In much the same way we the audience do not know how to feel because we do not know Jamie. We are obviously saddened by the death and realize that Samson should be arrested but we dont feel strongly for Jamie as an individual.<br /><br />There are several similarities between Rivers Edge and Twin Peaks (1990-1991) especially in the overall feel of the film. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch were thinking of Rivers Edge when they were creating their series. After all Tim Hunter did go on to direct three episodes of Twin Peaks.<br /><br />Crispin Glovers performance as the hyperactive frantic Layne is an Oscar worthy performance. Always in a rush and always worried about keeping Samson from getting caught Layne is an intense character that seems to be on speed. If you have seen Crispin Glover in any film you know that he can deliver a line like no one else. It is always a treat to see him perform. The other great performance in Rivers Edge is by Dennis Hopper. His portrayal of Feck the shut in drug dealer who has one leg and an inflatable sex doll he talks to named Elly reminded me of a more toned down and more humorous version of Frank Booth Hoppers character in David Lynchs film Blue Velvet (1986).<br /><br />Rivers Edge is great film and I believe it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic when in reality we need to step up and speak out against the evils in the world.',pos
'Michelle Rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the charging force for other actresses to look out for. She has the audacity to place herself in a rarely seen tough-girl role very early in her career (and pull it off) which is a feat that should be recognized. Although her later films pigeonhole her to that same role this film was made for her ruggedness.<br /><br />Her character is a romanticized student/fighter/lover struggling to overcome her disenchanted existence in the projects which is a little overdone in film...but not by a girl. That aspect of this film isnt very original but the story goes in depth when the heated relationships that this girl has to deal with come to a boil and her primal rage takes over.<br /><br />I havent seen an actress take such an aggressive stance in movie-making yet and Im glad that shes getting that original twist out there in Hollywood. This film got a 7 from me because of the average story of ghetto youth but it has such a great actress portraying a rarely-seen role in a minimal budget movie. Great work.',pos
'Do you know what farmers spray on fields ? Thats right - Manure  so when the BBC decided to make a much hyped conspiracy thriller about GMOs and farming what we got was some of the smelliest manure the BBC has inflicted upon its audience <br /><br />!!!! SPOILERS !!!!<br /><br />FIELDS OF GOLD opens with a bunch of masked scientists in a lab where a female scientist ( According to the right on trendy BBC all scientists are women ) announces  A new strain of wheat that will save the third world from hunger  then the story switches to another equally bland scene . If youre going to make a thriller of any type shouldnt you open with a hook that grabs the audience ? DOCTOR WHO was brilliant at this as was THE X- FILES while 28 DAYS LATER opened with a hook that took place in a laboratory. I guess someone at the BBC didnt think this thriller needed a hook because the viewers had trailers stuffed down their throat for weeks in advance <br /><br />As the ( Not very exciting ) story continues a couple of journalists ( Ones a drunken man with morals lower than Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush combined while the other is a female journalist full of virtue ) investigating patients at a county hospital who might be getting bumped off via  Mercy killings  . Its at this point things start getting confused as the female journalist is threatened by MI5 spooks and the first episode ends with the main MI5 spook getting murdered <br /><br />The second episode reveals that the patients at the county hospital have actually been dying due to being infected with a VRSA superbug . This is when things go totally hay wire . All throughout FIELDS OF GOLD the audience have been led to believe the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening sequence have been behind the deaths - But theyre not . It turns out the bad guy is an organic farmer who has been manufacturing the VRSA superbug in his bedroom and the story ends via THE MATRIX camera work with the drunken male journalist setting fire to a field ridden with VRSA thereby spreading the superbug throughout the land <br /><br />I find it impossible to say a good word about FIELDS OF GOLD . At the time of its broadcast I was both a member of the Scottish Green Party and Greenpeace . I have since renounced my time in the environmental movement but even now I am somewhat offended by how environmentalists are portrayed here and to have the bad guy spreading a fatal genetically engineered virus as a warning to the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very silly. Its a bit like a CND member letting off a nuke in London to warn of the dangers of nuclear war . I was also slightly offended as to how the male characters were written as being bastards while all the females were highly intelligent and morally superior to men . Theres also other problems with the script especially with regard to VRSA . If unlike the scriptwriters you take the time and trouble to research VRSA youll find its entirely different from what is seen here . Oh and if you set fire to diesel it doesnt explode like napalm . Perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles JEEPERS CREEPERS structure wise whereby the last ten minutes contradicts most of what has gone before . Where as JEEPERS CREEPERS only lasted about 90 minutes FIELDS OF GOLD lasted twice that length so is doubly irritating and illogical<br /><br />As a footnote environmentalism never makes a good theme for a thriller ( Anyone remember those Steven Segal movies ? ) and its about time TV and film producers realized this',neg
'I cant quite say that Jerry Springer:Ringmaster is the worst film I have ever seen. The film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film Ive ever seen (Prom Night II) interested me enough for me to hate it. My only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when I looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed. It had seemed much more like years. It is an endless repetition of poor people (or what Jerry Springer seems to believe poor people are) screwing each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing. The plot which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the Jerry Springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters. This makes it impossible to care what happens to them. It never mattered to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom. Maybe Im not supposed to care about them. Maybe Im supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type-- to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny. Too bad it isnt. The humor is not outrageous. Its innocuous. Its predictable. Humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function. Scatology is not wit. An example. A mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed. To take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughters boyfriend. Since I was over the shock of Jerry Springers show a long time ago I had the same reaction I had to Andrew Dice Clays obscene nursery rhymes; not laughter just yawning. Lastly I found Springers pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing. If he really were an advocate of the poor he would bring on a single mom from Bed-Sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in New York City on $12000 a year. Or failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits. Jerry Springer gets millions for his shows his movie his book and videos. His guests just get round trip air fare hotel accommodations and a chance to humiliate themselves. If he liked poor people so much hed give them at least some of the money they earn for him. It appears that Springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself. Jeez with all his fine work youd think hed have earned our respect already. Anyway the film is weak and boring. It doesnt even succeed at being offensive. If you want to have a better evening videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that.',neg
'But to be a little more precise I do not think that it is as bad as it actually could be. Eventhough the actors (famous to semi-famous) didnt do a very great job. Directors fault?

'Pecker is a young unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star in the public the media and the local art scene with his pictures showing the dirty reality of all-day life just as dirty underwear or human excrements.

Although the pacing of the plot becomes a big flaw sometimes and cant compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of Waters brilliant Serial Mom its still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie-girl who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable dish...

'After some internet surfing I found the Homefront series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago. The resolution and quality are poor. The images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. Although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program Nightline complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990s. Even with the poor image quality the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.<br /><br />To this shows credit the casting was nearly perfect. Everyone was believable and really looked the part. Their acting was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong). The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor. The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time. For example conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.<br /><br />As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. For one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading. When WWII ended in 1945 there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either. Curiously the first episode of the show Homefront begins in 1945 after the war had ended. Thats like shooting the first episode of Gilligans Island showing the castaways being rescued. The whole premise of the shows namesake is completely lost. I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. Additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940s. By the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. The show is set in River Run Ohio near Toledo. However the shows ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr. who portray the Davis family. Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years. We get it. Were also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for Homefront. The acting talents of Williams Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened / angry black family. The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something. The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing and leave it at that. Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.<br /><br />In yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.<br /><br />Personally I think this series had great potential. The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941  1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. Of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. But no the writers of Homefront (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. Instead they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.',neg
'Patricia Arquette plays American doctor Laura Bowman who takes a holiday to Burma in an attempt to heal her spirit after the murders of her husband and young son. She is left behind in Rangoon during a military crackdown and leaves the city with an aging man who works as a tour guide. But he is no simple tour guide; he is a professor who introduces her to the life outside of the tourist traps ... the two of them get caught up in the political upheaval and Laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses its own people.<br /><br />This movie is one of my favorites because of its themes. First its informational (describing some of the injustices that are occurring in Burma). Secondly its about a womans struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. Thirdly its about compassion and sacrifice and people coming together - without even knowing each other - to endure pain and fear.<br /><br />Just about every beautiful scene in this movie is important; nothing is wasted here. Its an earnest and moving film. There is also a very emotional score composed by Hans Zimmer which complements scenes nicely.<br /><br />A definite recommend especially to people concerned with human rights ... and people who want to know What purpose can I serve?<br /><br />',pos
'Stinger starts 3 Months Ago on the submarine the SS Newark where genetic experiments have gone awry & the crew member are brutally slaughtered by large killer scorpions... Jump to Camp Pendleton a couple of months later where General Ashford (James Cagnard) briefs Lieutenant Williams (John Miranda) on his mission to board the Newark & assist genetic scientist Dr. Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows) before anyone knows it a group of corporate scientists & marines are on-board the Newark & are shocked to discover he mutilated corpses of the crew apart from Dr. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark) who doesnt make much sense. Its not long before the scorpions attack first to fall is Lt. Williams so Sergeant Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) is promoted & takes the responsibility to get everyone to safety & end the menace of the giant scorpions forever...<br /><br />This Sweedish America co-production was directed by Martin Munthe & he also handled the cinematography & I thought this was a strictly by-the-numbers uninspiring creature feature. Its early into the new year & Stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster/creature/insect type film Ive seen in 2007 hopefully things can only get better... The script by Mat Nastos is incredibly clichéd & gets all of its ideas from other films most notably Aliens (1986) lets see theres the isolated location in this case being a submarine theres the hastily assembled team of marines including one who chews on a cigar throughout the entire film theres the scientists including a blonde Sweedish one to try & explain it all & the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life & the final ingredient being the monster/alien/insect or whatever in this case theres loads of large scorpions running around but theyre not utilised in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers. Yeah its all here unfortunately Stinger isnt an Aliens if you get what I mean. Its a touch long at over 100 minutes & its throughly predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace & as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the IMDb...<br /><br />Director Munthe doesnt distinguish himself its not scary theres a lack of atmosphere & the action scenes are dull & unexciting. Theres not many scorpion attacks & its almost an hour before any significant action occurs the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but I have seen worse thats for sure. I mean thats not to say the effects in Stinger are good but Ive seen worse. There isnt much blood or gore theres some mutilated bodies some decapitated heads & someone is ripped in half. The only clever & amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked Sweedish female scientist asks her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the scorpions... However there was a moment which had me groaning & tearing my hair out in its stupidity as a bloke tries to repair the submarines circuitry & get the lights working by hitting the power supply/computer boards with a hammer & it works as well...<br /><br />Technically Stinger is average at best & theres the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous. Stinger was shot in Stockholm in Sweeden if your interested. The acting was poor & theres nothing else to say.<br /><br />Stinger isnt a great film & it isnt a great horror film either I cant recommend it at all but Ive seen worse. If you liked Stinger (unlikely) you might like the similarly themed giant scorpions on the loose films Tail Sting (2001) or Scorpius Gigantus (2006) (just as unlikely).',neg
'Most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of academia cut off from the communities in which they study and live. Their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty. Steven Greenstreets documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members.<br /><br />The documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population. As is usual the people who scream the most get the most media attention. Other than its misrepresentation of the community in which the film was set the documentary was well made. My only dispute is that the feelings and uproar depicted in the film were attributed to the entire community rather than the few individuals who expressed them.<br /><br />Naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political viewpoints but it is ridiculous to implicate an entire community of people in the actions of a few radicals.',neg
'A memorable line from a short lived show. After viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense. Instead of Ready / Break our quarter back said FOOTBALL and the rest of the squad responded YOU BET! A fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show. Using this line added a unique element to our season that Ill never forget. We had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line. The show was pretty much a stinker but it lives on in the memories of the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi intramural flag football squad at West Virginia Tech.',neg
'Whats happening to RGV? He seems to repeat himself in every movie. Has he run out of creative ideas? If he has time to take a back seat. Went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did I imagine it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it wouldnt the promos said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat after all isnt he the same guy who directed Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have my doubts after watching Aag. I am not going to talk about the plot or the story as most of it is taken from the original if you are really dying to go and see this one you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own! So Veeru becomes Heero (how corny is that?) guess Heeru wouldnt sound that great. Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in Company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) doesnt exists at all. In fact the more charming Nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes. This reaches a peak by the end. Raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others he is a guy to watch in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I am afraid I dont have the patience to write more.',neg
'This film tried but ultimately it was a waste of talent. It tried to hard to be sexy. Im not putting down the works of such actresses as Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who will find something besides TVs Le Femme Nikita worthy of her talents.) I just didnt find even in Ms. Wilsons so-called near-seduction scene with Mrs. Barkin any real emotion even though I know the thespians tried very hard to make the scene work. If the sexual elements of Wilsons disturbed sex victim didnt touch our heart (which it didnt even by an ending it didnt deserve) neither did the murder element of the plot. Perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction but I didnt feel for anyone in this movie and without this feeling a movie doesnt work for me. If you are interested in a movie about lesbianism there are a least two films on either side of the specturum to check out: 1.) The gulity pleasure of Bound which works well in a noir setting; and 2.) The more honest and touching story of a lesbian growing up in Hells Kitchen called All Over Me. Its a well-defined indie from the mid-90s that handles that coming-of-age issue with feeling not forced sexuality. Both would be a better rental than Mercy which has next to nothing.',neg
'OK I would not normally watch a Farrelly brothers movie. I cant recall ever watching one. I also dont recall watching a Jimmy Fallon movie. Alright I did watch taxi but I said penance and was forgiven for that mistake. But this movie had Drew Barrymore and I just think she is the cutest thing. I dont know what it is about her but I just smile the whole time I am watch her. She just captivates me that way. I mean I even watched Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates. How sad is that? This wasnt the greatest baseball movie - it wasnt supposed to be. It was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for. It had a predictable ending but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile.',pos
'This is a totally delightful and unexpected film. You start by following a young person who hopes to get into the qualifying football game between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran win they will get into the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is the young person is a girl and girls (or women for that matter) are not allowed into football matches to sit with men. What follows is a wonderful comedy played with consummate skill by a small ensemble cast. The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on the freedom of women (and for that matter the young soldiers who have to corral them). There are some excellent set pieces not least when one of the girls must go to the toilet and of course the stadium has no toilets for women. The camera work is of the simplest and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage play. Yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite. Great cinema? No probably not; great entertainment - for sure.',pos
'As with FOOTPRINTS (1975) I became aware of this one purely by accident: it was mentioned in a review of THE LIBERTINE (1969) which I researched when that film turned up on late-night Italian TV as being in a similar vein; incidentally I missed out on that screening of THE LIBERTINE (though I acquired it via the same channel later on) but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the English-dubbed R1 DVD during my sojourn in Hollywood in late 2005/early 2006. Actually in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it I was let down by THE LIBERTINE – being too light-hearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme (the sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple)!; to be honest for much of the time I was afraid that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN would go the exact same route…but was subsequently amply redeemed by a wicked (if not exactly unpredictable) final twist.<br /><br />The film concerns the freethinking social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era: an eminent philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a female journalist (Dagmar Lassander) at his fashionable home for the week-end; however it transpires that he’s a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate (or even kill) them! Therefore for the first half of the narrative we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at Leroy’s hands (including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own image!)…until the tables are subtly but unsurprisingly turned: she not only emancipates herself from his control but teaches him that Man and Woman can co-exist harmoniously – except that Lassander’s following her own personal agenda as well!! <br /><br />The leads are perfectly cast and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood; furthermore it’s greatly abetted by a typically effervescent “Euro-Cult? score (from the ever-reliable Stelvio Cipriani) and the imaginative – even outré – look (the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form with a steel-trap where its sexual organ should be seems to emanate from Freud: incidentally this prop figured prominently in stills I’d seen previously from THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN…but it barely registers in the film proper!). Other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program “Sexual Aberrations And The Stars? and an idyll at a castle belonging to Leroy’s family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarfish manservant. One of the highlights then is easily Lassander’s erotic dance virtually in the nude – an episode which actually spearheads the ‘humanization’ of Leroy; eventually the two characters have a ‘showdown’ in the latter’s pool – amusingly set to a Spaghetti Western-type theme! <br /><br />In the long run for all its stylishness the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporaneous Japanese masterpiece by Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969). Finally it’s worth noting that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN was distributed in the U.S. by film-maker Radley Metzger’s company Audubon Films; he would even employ its production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To get to the edition I watched: apart from the usual shortcomings in the English-dubbing department the presentation here was further marred by a rather washed-out appearance and brief instances of distracting extraneous noise on the soundtrack! By the way there seems to be some confusion with respect to the film’s running-time: its length given on various sources ranges anywhere from 84 to 108 minutes – all I can say however is that the copy I own ran for 87 minutes!',pos
'For anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch. However it also leaves you wanting more. I loved the way that every character (detective)made an appearance. Least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie. My guess is Bayless of course. This like the series was a very well put together series of scenes. This is a series I wish had lived on. Thanks to the cast for some wonderful TV.',pos
'The pioneering Technicolor Cinematography (Winner of Special Technical Achievement Oscar) is indeed enchanting. Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer and youve got a rather pleasant picture.<br /><br />Unfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over-blown acting leave much to be desired. Still there have not been any more breathtaking Technicolor films before this one (1936) and very few since then that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors. Cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in Robin Hood (1938) Jesse James (1939) and Gone With The Wind (1939) will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here. The Garden Of Allah will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography.',pos
'I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was it bad.. From the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography-- none of it worked. Not to mention the set design/costumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period (it spans the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so). Even John Hurt whos usually an amazing actor was so over-the- top ridiculous. Granted Quinten Crisp is an over-the-top guy to begin with but Hurt was given nothing to work with here. I dont know much else to say except the audience I saw it with absolutely loved it.. so maybe its just me. But audiences love anything at film festivals when theyre sitting next to the director and all the actors. Its not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it will play. Personally I thought this movie was terrible. On the other hand it was so terrible that it was hilarious. Get drunk and give it a shot when its on HBO in 2 years if it ever makes it that far.',neg
'I decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on IMDb it is cited that John Woo a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre-American years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest made in US films plans to remake it. Well here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever: The plot of the film is simple and even clichéd by todays standards but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads unique direction by Mellville cinematography music and its style. There is no way any director today can make such film it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in todays Box-office targeted movie business. <br /><br />John Woo did make a more or less decent film which borrowed from Melvilles Le Samourai - The Killer but remember it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive (in salaries) but cheap (in acting merits) actors. So what Im saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made together with another film by Melville - Le Samourai. Watch it. And even if the remake will be made try to avoid it before seeing the great original first.',pos
'Another trashy Grade Z quickie from the prolific Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson´s 13 inch Clint Eastwood-like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head(!) to Earth and gets involved in a gang war in South Bronx! Mercifully short but deadeningly dull with the cheesiest effects since Attack of the 50Ft Woman. They should have fired the continuity guy too: Note how Thomerson´s sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot. Laughably bad but that´s why we watch these movies ain´t it? Sequel ´Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys´ is reportedly even worse if that´s possible.<br /><br />0 (of ****)<br /><br />',neg
'I watched this movie recently mainly because I am a Huge fan of Jodie Fosters. I saw this movie was made right between her 2 Oscar award winning performances so my expectations were fairly high. Unfortunately I thought the movie was terrible and Im still left wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself may have been somewhat believable if someone like Mel Gibson had played the role of the hit-man. The idea of Jodie running off with Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy into. I did think that Jodie looked great throughout the movie which was probably the only reason I watched the entire thing. Maybe parading Jodie around with as few clothes on as possible was the only reason the movie was made. I saw a TV biography of Jodie where basically all of her movies were commented on in chronological order and this movie was the only one never mentioned. After seeing it I can now see why.',neg
'First of all the actor they have to play Jesus has blue eyes... half the actors they have playing Jews have blue eyes. Arent there enough brown-eyed actors out there? Jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves. He was a full-blooded Jew! Second of all what is it with old English-language movies that are supposed to take place in non-English-speaking countries and everybody has English accents? (Another example is David Leans Dr. Zhivago.) Arent there enough either Jewish actors or actors who can do a Israeli accent? The movie often is not true to the Scriptures and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of Jesuss claim to be the Messiah. In the bible when Jesus is baptized by John a voice comes from heaven saying This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased (Matthew 3:17 Mark 1:11 Luke 3:22). In the movie John the Baptist says this! The screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy as well. For example in the bible the angel Gabriel tells Mary she will become pregnant with the Son of God (Luke 1:26-38) but in the movie we do not see or hear any angel - Mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam and when Marys mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her she doesnt hear or see anyone either. Also in the movie when Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees in the Temple in Jerusalem he says You shall not see me here again not until you learn to cry Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord for I and my father are one and the same. The correct line (Matthew 23:39 and Luke 13:35)is You will not see me again until you say Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Period. Jesus never claimed to be God. The movie cuts out a lot of important parts (the Sermon on the Mount is very expurgated) but then spends a lot of time on stuff that isnt even in the bible (a whole scene with Mary Magdalene talking with a john). It seems like the screenwriter instead of wanting to do a movie version of the Scriptures wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind (and between) the scenes. The movie has one gem though - during the scene where Jesus tells the parable of the Prodigal Son at Matthew the tax collectors house I had tears streaming down my face. It is the best movie Ive seen about Jesuss ministry (but that isnt saying much because the others are just terrible). Jesus Christ Superstar is my favourite movie about Jesuss last days (The Passion of the Christ is way too graphic) though I like how Jesus of Nazareth instead of just ending with Jesuss death continues on and shows his resurrection.',neg
'The Kite Runner was beautiful poignant and very moving. I particularly loved the two child actors in the film as well as the actor portraying the father. It really made me want to go back and read the book again.<br /><br />The music was a wonderful part of the fabric of the movie. If there is a soundtrack coming out for the film I will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. It is also a visually stunning film. The cinematography was gorgeous and really added to experience.<br /><br />The Brazilian word saudades is very descriptive of how I felt at the end of the film...it is a deep feeling of longing for someone or someplace which is very sweet but also tinged with an inescapable sadness (definition provided years ago by Antonio Carlos Jobim).<br /><br />Saw it at a small cinema here for an advance screening. I would love to see it again on a really large screen with a tricked out sound system.<br /><br />Cant wait for the formal release. I will definitely recommend the film to friends.',pos

As simple as the story goes many English speaking viewers didnt get the whole story.

She went to Singapore trying to tell him but didnt.<br /><br />Spoiler<br /><br />The mandarin translation of the movie title actually means flowery like moment or memory. The phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was inpermanance and short. The whole movie pretty much fit the title. Not to mention the flowery Cheung Sam.<br /><br />My favorite scene was definately the street corner in the alley. It looks so beautiful the sun shining on the old and faded wall at night in the dark in the rain truely a poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of intimacy of their relationship seeing them standing against the wall and talk quietly. I felt a terrible heartache when Mr Chow was rehearsing his departing moment and Mrs Chen cried on his shoulder.... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai!<br /><br />As much as I like this one Chungking Express still top my favorite. However Ill give this one a 10 as well.

'Since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline I wont do it.<br /><br />However Id like to restate that Bardems interpretation is terrific as also are those of the other actors and actresses in this film. <br /><br />Reading the previous comments Ive noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesnt show points of view opposed to euthanasia and that those little present are ridiculed. In my honest opinion this is far from true.<br /><br />There are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving Ramón Sampedro and wanting him to stay and understanding his desire to die. Most obvious of those are the family. For instance Ramóns sister-in-law never talks for or against euthanasia. Another such character is Gené (the social rights activist) who in the last moment tells Ramón to re-think it all. The scene clearly shows that she doesnt want him to die.<br /><br />Then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia. Ramóns brother is clearly against it as is his father (Theres only one thing worse than the death of son and its having a son that wants to die.) Other users have commented that the discussion between Ramón and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that Ramón is GOOD and the priest is BAD. Well no doubt the scene is comic but that doesnt mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. From my point of view the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince Ramón to keep on living using arguments totally alien to Ramóns thinking. The priests speech goes on the line of God gives and God takes We arent the owners of our own lives they belong to God... and so on. The comedy arises from the fact that Ramón is atheist and all the priest is saying to him is therefore nonsense.<br /><br />This film is the antithesis of manicheism it leaves the spectator the chance to think on the subject and make up his/her own opinion. And above anything else is a chant of FREEDOM.',pos
'Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones I wondered once again why remake a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. I couldnt believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed passionless in comparison. This version was pleasant but bland.<br /><br />The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. The therapist added an interesting bit of color that didnt seem important. I liked it when at the end he said hed be back but the movie was over before he returned. I have Mostly Martha at home. Every now and then I revisit it.',neg
'I would like to say that I absolutely loved Campfire Tales! To me it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted ending. As if the contents of the movie werent scary or weird enough you have the ending. Its a very awesome movie and Im so happy that its being released on DVD on August 30th.I will not hesitate to get my copy on that day.I dont think the movie received all the credit or recognition it should have because all these other movies came out shortly after and was acknowledge but if it werent for my brother telling me about the movie I wouldnt have known. Which stinks because in my opinion its far better than any Scream I know what you did Last Summer or any other horror for that time. So I hope that you are able to see the movie yourself and at least be able to see the difference. I loved it and being a horror movie junkie Campfire Tales was like dessert for me!',pos
'This cartoon is short on plot but is a visually stunning piece of work. There will be very very minor spoilers: <br /><br />This short has a story thats incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. Thats pretty much the plot such as it is. But this cartoon isnt about the plot-its about the color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936 such bright color was still something of a novelty and theres some incredibly inspired work here.<br /><br />My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point there are a series of pipes aligned in a row from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.<br /><br />This is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing. Its available on the DVD Attack of the 30s Characters. Recommended particularly if you like good animation.',pos
'35 years after this was made Castro still reigns. Unfortunately were left scratching our heads wondering how the dim-witted maniac played by scenery-chewing Jack Palance made it as far as 1960. I stumbled back across this recently and was amused at noticing the incomparable Sid Haig and B movie favorite Paul (Untouchables) Picerni among the rebels. Fleischer was obviously well past his prime when he directed this foolishness. Some of the lines are classic in a Did he really say that kind of way? The other thing I just noticed is that the score and the sound (NOT the dialog) are actually excellent -- the only first-rate elements of the entire production. So dont watch this to learn anything about history or acting but if you feel like watching this as a goof bring the beers and have some fun.',neg
'There are numerous films relating to WW2 but Mother Night is quite distinctive among them: In this film we are introduced to Howard Campbell (Nolte) an American living in Berlin and married to a German Helga Noth (Lee) who decides to accept the role of a spy: More specifically a CIA agent Major Wirtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell who becomes a Nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of the Hitler regime. However the deal is that the US Government will never acknowledge Campbells role in the war for national security reasons and so Campbell becomes a hated figure across the US. After the war he tries to conceal his identity but the past comes back and haunts him. His only friend is Wirtanen but even he cannot do much for the avalanche of events that fall upon poor Campbell...<br /><br />The story is deeply touching as we watch the tragedy of Campbell who although a great patriot is treated by disdain by everybody who surrounds him. Not only that but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him have many secrets of their own. Vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere with Campbells despair building up and almost choking the viewer.<br /><br />Nolte plays the role of his life in my opinion; he is even better than in Affliction although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent and the same can be said for the whole cast in general.<br /><br />I havent read the book so I cannot appraise how the film compares to it. In any case this is something of no importance here: My critique is upon the film per se and the film wholeheartedly deserves a 9/10.',pos
'Having been a Marine I can tell you that the D.I. is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting Marine Corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men. Jack Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore a tough but fair drill instructor in Paris Island North Carolina. The film centers on one recruit who doesnt seem to get with the program. A more recent film Full Metal Jacket also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing.',pos
'Today You Die was the 4th Seagal movie in a mini marathon I just held. Wow I dont know where to start. He seems to mumble his lines more and more as time goes on and the scenes between Seagal and Treach where they seem to improv are embarrassing. And what did his girlfriends dreams have to do with anything else in the plot? I cant recommend this to anyone but the most die hard Seagal fan and even then you are better off with his earlier work. Of the 4 films in my marathon (Submerged Into the Sun Foreigner and Today You Die) Today was the worst. A previous reviewer mentioned this but the usage of stock footage was quite obvious.',neg
'Youve got to think along the lines of Last Tango in Paris for this one because the mood and emotion runs along the same lines and maintains the same heights - the difference being that in this exceptional intense and torrid depiction of love among the ruins of a Dostoyevskyian dispossessed the setting is a gay-subcultural milieu - perhaps even one that is set to vanish in time and not the equally arresting but heterosexual context of Bertoluccis own film.<br /><br />The last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay cinema. To talk of pornography or gay self-effacement misses the point and intelligence of this work. This film though on first impression appears to take us into the familiar & often depicted underworld of gay street-life then precedes to subvert the rules of this genre by exaggerating it to a super-real degree. The result is a hyper-charged emotional heightening - an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of big universal themes and giant gestures.<br /><br />This film snatches the high ground because of the brilliant performances by its actors notably a young Jean Hugues Anglade and the directing. A tour- De -force of cinema. Outstanding in ambition and its unceasing plummet into the depths of human emotion. As a contribution to gay cinema this film conquers this difficult ground and makes it its own triumph.',pos
'I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were lackluster the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all it was on the back of the box. I dont think I can remember a movie being THIS bad in a long time and Im a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies!! ;) Even that couldnt save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand (or lay in this case) in front of a camera.<br /><br />I was pretty much let down by the overall zombie effect. Since apparently in this movie zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there and casually talking about it at a gas station (one with an in-house windshield repair but no interior bathroom) the zombie-movie genre isnt even a factor until the end. Even then a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girls clothes doesnt really constitute being a zombie movie.<br /><br />On to the vampires: Apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female which is OK by me. Im not sure how vampires are out in the daylight or the why/how of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road still holding his gun with a stake through his heart just waiting for the Queen of the Vampires to flick it all the way through. The last segment in the old nunnery made no sense and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire Do you think we did the right thing? by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie that about put it over the top.<br /><br />The acting and special effects were at an all-time low also. You could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the General. Speaking of the General where did they find THIS Kenny Rogers look-alike anyways? No idea what he was the General of aside of generally confusing and misplaced.<br /><br />All in all watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste $3. Just my $0.02.',neg
'I watched the presentation of this on PBS in the U.S. when it originally aired in 1988 (?). Assuming the miniseries was available on DVD I purchased first editions of all three books last year. Since then I have been searching for the series on internet movie sites. Today I found this web site. I will give up the search.<br /><br />I too would like to buy this complete - 26 episodes - miniseries. After buying the DVDs I would read each book then watch the episodes for that book. That is what I did with John LeCarres Karla trilogy and Larry McMurtys Texas ranger trilogy.<br /><br />Does anyone have any suggestions for great books or book series that became very good TV miniseries - or movie series - that are now available on DVD?',pos
'I remember my parents not understanding Saturday Night Live when I was 15. They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I am approaching their age I still remember and find I understand many of the things my kids love. But this is pathetic. I cannot say I have seen any by Sarah except for a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see her as anything special. But this show is just so far below what I expected from her. The IMDb write up made it sound like potential. So just for that I started watching the first episode. I turned it off half way through. Anything else is better that that. Jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program. Well Sarah this adult is inly moved to turn you off. I just cant believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy. Only good thing I can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes deposited here saving other shows from such an embarrassment.',neg
'Recherche is a good word to describe this movie.<br /><br />Lets say every movie has a selling point a gimmick. Transformers gimmick is the awesome effects as well as fan boys nostalgia. Sleepless in Seattles gimmick is situational in their tag-line What if someone you never met someone you never saw someone you never knew was the only someone for you? Many romance relies heavily on these gimmicks and some through draw of big names. Leap Years employs both by using the Irish folklore as the circumstance and featuring considerably famous names within the country.<br /><br />So now that the audience are in the cinema besides all the usual elements in characters conflict or consequences crisis resolve and denouement they also look forward to stimulating dialog more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years interesting sub-plots and perhaps to a certain extent a good twist in the middle or towards the end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters.<br /><br />This is what Jean Yeo is trying not to achieve. If theyve tried to their goal was apparently in the other court at the other stadium on the other end of the planet. She and her writer Alain Layrac utterly failed to provide stimulating dialog. Most of the lines were contrived. It seems that they have a bag filled with lines which she would like to use in her movie: Okay these are the lines and quotes which Ive heard or read from either movies Ive seen or books Ive read before and they all sound good to me. If they sound good to me they will sound good to the audience. Therefore all i have to do is piece them all together. I am going to use all of them. The result is cathartic. I cant say that the lines were unnecessary and bears no relation to the story or in driving the plot on but they seem to spring out of nowhere catching you off guard with these quotable quotes.<br /><br />On a personal level i know people who cite quotes based on most of the situations in our dialog trying to make it meaningful to themselves while nodding along. I dont go out with them anymore because the urge to punch them is overwhelming.<br /><br />Secondly the characters portrayed are silly and one-dimensional. With exception to the unnatural dialog which implies their motivation (necessary to drive the plot) there was no sense of conviction in them. I havent an idea who they are. They are all simpletons spouting lines from the advice column of a female-oriented magazine.<br /><br />The gimmick in the leap years is not enough to drive the story on because the circumstances are too shallow. Then again there are movies with less but fared better than this arent there. They made it up with my first and second point. Moreover the sub-plots are inconsequential (not that its a bad thing for movies) and thin (bad thing).<br /><br />Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to pass off the terrible plot with fancy locations and passable photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to attain the approval from some viewers than the others with the good use of cinematography soundtrack and filming location. These non-discerning viewers.<br /><br />It is not even the kind of movie that is so bad that its good. It is just bad. Dont watch this.',neg
'This movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone such as The Robe Quo Vadis and Samson and Delilah unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isnt a Jew or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on biblical-related stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned nothing good came from pagan Egypt Greece or Rome.<br /><br />Any movie that preaches about the one true god gives a short shift to freedom of religion. The movies ignore the fact that ancient Judeas lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism. Most 1950s religious movies also overlook the loss of freedom the occurred after Christians assumed political power in the 4th century.',neg
'I will probably always go to see a Woody Alleb movie as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness. Just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile. sadly however this film just doesnt make it on any score. Saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty. Im sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of Woody but what can one say? Its probably time for him to concentrate on his Clarinett which in my opinion he is rather quite good. Saying all of this Ill still probably go to any new film Woody may come out with in the future. Theres always hope and Ill continue to love and respect The WOODY!!',neg
'So many literary adaptations are disappointments. There are many reasons for that but usually it is the need to cut down a complex novel to the size of a screenplay. The Dead is unusual - it had to be padded as the short story itself is a tiny relatively short gem. It may in fact be the finest short story in the English language. In beautifully spare language it tells of the realization of Gabriel Conroy that his life and the lives of so many around him are controlled by memories of the dead. Even his own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him.<br /><br />To bring such a short story to the cinema was always going to be tricky. John Huston did a magnificent job. He never gave in to temptation to play it up or use fancy technique to expand on the story. It is simple and true with outstanding acting. The only slight miss-step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy.<br /><br />Its rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be itself a masterpiece but I think its fair to use this term for this movie. Its not a bravura piece of film making but it is simple and pure - I always think of Ozus movies when i think of The Dead its at that level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom.',pos
'OkulThe School is a result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. Having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas. Of course it doesnt mean that they are all grand. I think Okul is one of them. It is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not. It is not successful on being scary either. So what is it? Actors are so average especially Deniz Akkaya is pretty annoying with the teacher role. I am sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder. Maybe concentrating on one topic such as making it scary or vice versa. But directors have missed the target this time. ** out of *****',neg
'The 1930s. Classy elegant Adele (marvelously played with dignified resolve by Debbie Reynolds) and batty frumpy Helen (the magnificent Shelley Winters going full-tilt wacko with her customary histrionic panache) are the mothers of two killers. They leave their seamy pasts in the Midwest behind and move to Hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring kid starlets. Adele begins dating dashing millionaire Lincoln Palmer (the always fine Dennis Weaver). On the other hand religious fanatic Helen soon sinks into despair and madness.<br /><br />Director Curtis (Night Tide Ruby) Harrington working from a crafty script by Henry Farrell (who wrote the book Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? was based on and co-wrote the screenplay for Hush ... Hush Sweet Charlotte) adeptly concocts a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt fear repression and religious fervor running dangerously amok. The super cast have a ball with their colorful roles: Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous elocution teacher Agnes Moorehead as a stern fire-and-brimstone radio evangelist Yvette Vickers as a snippy overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star Logan Ramsey as a snoopy detective and Timothy Carey as a creepy bum. An elaborate talent recital set piece with Pamelyn Ferdin (the voice of Lucy in the Peanuts TV cartoon specials) serving as emcee and original Friday the 13th victim Robbi Morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead-on Mae West impression qualifies as a definite highlight. David Raskins spooky score a fantastic scene with Reynolds performing an incredible tango at a posh restaurant the flavorsome Depression-era period atmosphere Lucien Ballards handsome cinematography and especially the startling macabre ending are all likewise on the money excellent and effective.

'This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and its not difficult to see why. (A few spoilers - but for the ending youll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army. Boris leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him. Boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family. Mark Boris cousin rapes Veronika who feels obligated to marry him. Degraded and demeaned by the cowardly Mark Veronika clings to the hope that someday Boris will return. Superb camera-work and wonderful set pieces by director Kalatozov. (For anyone interested in film technique another movie by Kalatozov I AM CUBA has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana rises two stories to a cigar factory tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long long avenue - all without a cut.) Superb acting particularly by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris uncle) that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement. A devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by Samoilova. (This movie is frequently linked with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.)',pos
'Ever since I first played it in 1998 GoldenEye has been one of my favourite video games. In fact I recently bought an N64 purely so that I could own it and play it more often! The game is pretty much near-perfect: the single-player mode does a fantastic job of immersing yourself in Bonds shoes with varied mission objectives convincing weapons and great level design. Even though the enemies artificial intelligence is pretty basic by todays standards that only adds to GoldenEyes appeal. The method of obtaining cheats (completing levels within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released and even now I still havent cracked some of them!<br /><br />The game comes with a wonderful multiplayer mode for up to four players and while this isnt as advanced as the Combat Simulator in the games sequel Perfect Dark it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to smithereens with a barrage of RC-P90 fire! ;-)',pos

'Its dreadful rubbish. I liked How Do You Want Me Father Ted Green Wing and Bill Baileys standup act but I file this with Hippies and Planets Of The Apes (the re-imagining) under Great Pedigree went badly wrong. My guess is that it appeals to the same people who like Withnail and I. Its overwritten but to little end a luvvie-ish air pervades it and Bernard Black is simply a less camp Withnail. And I thought it was self-indulgent even *before* Dylan Moran became the writer. But the set up raidiates such comic potential that for the first 2 episiodes I didnt even notice that it wasnt in the slightest bit chortle-worthy.<br /><br />The things they are saying/doing *should* be funny but somehow they dont manage to register as more than mildly amusing or I can see how someone writing this down might have thought that this would be funny. What I am trying to say is that the situations/remarks are mildly humorous and yet too mundane/gentle/self-consciously surreal to be worth creating for and depicting in a sitcom. <br /><br />Life is too short.

'Heres a review for people like me. This movie sucks from beginning to end. I threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la MSF2000. The plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. The lead falls for a con man and it doesnt occur to her that she might get conned????? And shes rich???? And shes a famous psychologist????? COME ON people. She enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? That was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. Rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters war-starters and fur-wearers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But Ill give it a shot. That its not supposed to sound real is fine. I dont care. Its that everyone talks the SAME. Mamet cant create characters; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. Theyre confused about everyone being the same character. (However his later films do improve.)',neg
'This film is about a family trying to come to terms with the death of the mother/wife by moving to Genova Italy.<br /><br />The plot of Genova sounds promising but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. The film only consists of a collection of scenes depicting the daily life of the family such as swimming taking piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of such scenes are redundant and tiresome completely failing to engage viewers emotionally. The ending is very disappointing as it is not spectacular moving or emotional. I can safely say that I am disappointed and bored by Genova The only thing good about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova. Genova can serve as an extended tourism advertisement for the city but not as a film to be enjoyed.',neg

'Office work especially in this era of computers multi-functional copy machines e-mail voice mail snail mail and `temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as `Clockwatchers and `Office Space and very successfully. This latest addition to the temp/humor pool however `Haiku Tunnel directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth fails to live up to its predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in. Unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes; so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar.<br /><br />\tAs the narrator/star of the film Josh Kornbluth (playing Josh Kornbluth) points out in the opening frames (in a monologue delivered directly into the camera) this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of `San Franclisco. Its an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny. It is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which-- like the disclaimer-- just isnt all that funny.<br /><br />\tKornbluth plays Kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a `temp. Its a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time. But when he goes to work for a lawyer Bob Shelby (Warren Keith) he does too good a job on the first day and Shelby dispatches head secretary Marlina DAmore (Helen Shumaker) to Kornbluth to persuade him to go `perm. The thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of Kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position. Hes nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence (which of course they would never do with a temp) and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters hes typed up-- that now just have to be mailed out-- to fall back on (hes been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that `something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him). These are `important letters however and by the end of the week Kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk. And it doesnt take a genius to figure out that when Shelby finds out about it Kornbluths days as the fair-haired boy are going to be over. And quick.<br /><br />\tThe Brothers Kornbluth who not only directed but along with John Bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the Ben Stiller Book of Comedy where it says `If you play it straight they will laugh. But they didnt and the audience wont. Because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character (as well as most of the supporting characters in this case) `Plays funny-- as in he `knows hes being funny-- he never is. And thats exactly what Kornbluth does here; so rather than being `funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the Kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie. <br /><br />\tIn trying to discern exactly why this movie doesnt work it comes down to two basic reasons: The directing which-- if not necessarily `bad-- is at least careless; and secondly the performances beginning with that of Josh Kornbluth. Quite simply Kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here. Unlike Stiller or even Steve Martin-- both of whom use self-deprecating humor very effectively-- Kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light; he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real Kornbluth is in reality much more clever than Kornbluth the character. And being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film. Rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify Kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach. So what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus (given the potential of the rich subject matter) its easy to understand why this one just doesnt fly.<br /><br />\tThe one saving grace of the film is the performance by Warren Keith as Shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which-- in and of itself-- is fairly humorous. The effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project. <br /><br />\tShumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino) also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable; they at least make their scenes watchable and Overman even manages to elevate Kornbluths performance if only momentarily. But its still not enough to save the day or the film.<br /><br />\tThe supporting cast includes Amy Resnick (Mindy) Brian Thorstenson (Clifford) June Lomena (DaVonne) Joe Bellan (Jimmy the Mail Clerk) with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking Harry Shearer as the Orientation Leader-- a role that begs for an answer to the question `What was he thinking when he agreed to this? In any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someones comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us; the good ones (see paragraph one) may even become classics in their own right. `Haiku Tunnel however will doubtfully remain very long amongst them for its destiny lies elsewhere-- in a realm known only as: `Obscurity. I rate this one 1/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br />',neg

'I rented this movie simply because Rosario Dawson was in it. I sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats. Not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes but because it was a real film. No Hollywood BS no explosions no corny one liners; film. It drew you in slowly reeling you toward a tragically human fate. Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken. They like movies; mindless entertainment for entertainments sake alone. Michael Bays Transformers and the like were produced for just this audience. No need to think people just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain. Well even place advertisements throughout the movie to keep you buying our products. And dont forget the explosions we all love explosions. Here we make the distinction art can be entertaining but its also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways. Entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily. Movie are entertainment. Descent is a film. Film is art.<br /><br />If you still house a soul within your walking meat-sack apparatus this rape scene is every bit as powerful as Irreversable. The distinction here is that Irreversable was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued. Descent is about date rape. No less disgusting. No less depraved. Just different. This is about trust violation soul desecration and the scars that run deep. Had the character Maya been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene. But seeing as she was desperate to escape the scene is sickening. Jared is a sick and manipulative serial rapist and its wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair. How could Maya ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her Jareds slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping? She is ruined.<br /><br />The film as a whole is beautiful. The camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on Maya and the silent inner workings of her mind. All this accomplished by Rosario with facial expression and gesture. The soundtrack was excellent a blend of everything. My particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together; Maya dancing in a sea of writhing bodies something inside her awakening becoming aware all set to a beautifully sad Jeff Buckley tune.<br /><br />I dont think Ive really spoiled anything here but Im stopping before I do. Bottom line I think this was the best film of 2007 hands down. Unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you dont hack and slash gang rape or nuke anything then people just cant be bothered. Death isnt the worst thing that can happen to you. Its only the last thing that will happen in this existence. The worst things that happen never leave you. They are always in your thoughts. When you shower; when you brush your teeth; when you buy a Christmas present when you tie your shoe; they haunt you. They haunt you until that last thing releases you.<br /><br />Treat yourself. Challenge yourself. Watch this film.',pos

There is a scene where Adams character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real. The music is very different but very good. The Unborn in My opinion is a really creepy film thats superbly unpredictable and thats quite strange! I recommend all horror fans to this movie!',pos
'Ive seen tons of HK actioners and this one is right at the top of the genre. The action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything youve ever seen in any action movie. The kung fu is spectacular the pyrotechnics eye-popping the stunt work heartstopping. The editing is perfectly paced heightening the tension and complimenting the fluid camera work. This film is directed by old pro Corey Yuen whose resume is stuffed with some of the best work of the genre including the Jet Li vehicle The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is one thing lacking in this film it is the presence of a three-dimensional character though Martin the male lead comes closest to it. This movie is full of archetypes rather than characters--the sexy killer the goofy thief and his bitchy girlfriend the cackling villains. That said Shannon Lee has a terrific screen presence; shes great with the fighting the stunts and the guns. When shes onscreen its hard to take your eyes off her. Shes that good. Why isnt this woman a major star?',pos
'This movie to me is about family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not just for himself but for his family. I cant begin to tell you how I would be able to tell my little girl that daddy was going to Kansas City to cover Priest Holmes and the Kansas City Chiefs. Shed think it was the coolest thing like Morris son did. Living dreams with the family is what this one is about. I think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.',pos
'The Matador is a dark comedy starring Pierce Brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight-arrow happily-married American businessman (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico. Although the sardonic Julian (ironically surnamed Noble) appears to be a tough guy on the surface underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless. Thus on his birthday he reaches out to Danny a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by Julians unconventional lifestyle. In fact both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter franker moments of self-evaluation.<br /><br />Although the film is a bit too reminiscent of Analyze This and Midnight Run to feel entirely fresh and original The Matador nevertheless earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting. Brosnan looking aged and almost used up sinks his teeth into the role of Julian in a way he never has before. Playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being Brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment then genuine and sympathetic the next. He always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale. Kinnear is also excellent as the Regular Joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the Dark Side as his relationship with Julian deepens. Hope Davis does a fine job as Bean Dannys loyal and loving wife who like her husband finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and dangerous figure from a world far different from the one she knows.<br /><br />At times we find ourselves feeling that The Matador is holding something back from us not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise. At the end it feels a little too light a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should. This could be because this is the feature film debut for writer/director Richard Shephard and he hasnt quite gotten his movie pacing down yet. Still one appreciates the fact that he doesnt always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh.<br /><br />The Matador is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will hopefully signal a new phase in Brosnans acting career.',pos
'I would have liked to write about the story but there wasnt any. I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but hinglish is only funny for like 5 minutes after that its overkill. I would have liked to swoon over the keep-u-guessing suspense but it was as predictable as... um mm a Yash raj movie (?). I would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action but I dont like cartoons much. <br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />All in all this movie is perfect for: 1. people attempting suicide - I promise itll push you over the edge 2. Sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the Da-Vinci code wore. 3. People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4. Movie Piraters: More power to them. If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it. 5.Barnacles most types of plankton & green algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers. Afterthought: The director of the movie obviously is a species of his own. ( And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind..one is enough)<br /><br />Things that could have made this a better movie: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A Screenplay writer 4. A stunt coordinator 5. A story (Did I already say that?) 6. A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged (although even one who was challenged could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor=Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8. A statutory warning - Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health ?<br /><br />Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2. The English sub-titles - Mera Dil Kho Gaya becomes - My heart is in a void  Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya turns into Im a flirt Im a lover Im a vagabond ..priceless.<br /><br />In short Tashan to me is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player Tashan promises to lower your IQ and that.. in a mere 2.5 hours! Woot!<br /><br />*sigh*..But thats just me. I could be wrong Youve been warned anyways.',neg
'Just get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to come by the length is now standard and youve gone long enough without it. (When home video started there were at LEAST three versions with parts missing..) Everything youve read is true. There is no defending it and no living without it. The color is lush and wonderful to look at and the production values are pretty good for a Saturday afternoon kiddie epic. But no question..the whole Santa Vs. Satan angle is so jaw dropping STRANGE it made the movie a hit at the time and a cult fave once home video really got underway. How good/bad/strange/ is it? I only saw the TRAILER as a kidand remembered IT for nearly 30 years..including Murrays over the top voice over..I told my older sister and she called me a liar and could not believe it was POSSIBLE for ANYONE to make a movie where Santa vs.Satan.. Add to it stuff like Santa asking for the Virgin Marys blessing before setting off on Christmas eve kids wanting to capture him and make him their SLAVE..and an international kiddie sweat shop..and it probably comes close to a lot of nightmares kids had in the 60s.. Like others here I watch the thing every holiday season now. (My version of choice is The Mystery Science Theatre 3000 edition). But any old way you choose it the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must (along with Brianiac by the way..).It never fails to make me laugh. Better I think then SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS. Parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you out.(How many parents do YOU know go out for cocktails on Christmas Eve? If you get bored just go downstairs and play the piano. DANG..) Freaky boring disturbing funny childish strange..hey what more can you want?',pos
'What I liked best in this film is that like the films of Hitchcock it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously.<br /><br />Hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time. Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years. This is a thriller but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camera.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always. Cillian Murphy is creepier than he was in Batman Begins. In the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy. We dont see much of that these days because I suspect the Hollywood agents consider it a bad career move but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad.<br /><br />The directing is surprising stylish. The story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up.<br /><br />Red Eye is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling. If you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller Red Eye might be your ticket.',pos
'The plot of the movie is pretty simple : a viral outbreak turned the population into flesh-eating zombies. Those who left became hunters.<br /><br />Well first of all this IS NOT the worst zombie movie there is. Among the worst are Zombiez and the infamous Zombie Lake.<br /><br />In fact i think the idea for Quick and the Undead was very good just executed poorly. Considering the budget they had to work with this movie looks very good. I wasnt bored at all while watching it. Special Effects were solid although they did use CGI once (fat zombie getting shot in the head) but everything else (gore guts) was rather good. Acting is awful however. Our main guy looks like young Clint Eastwood other actors are not even worth mentioning. As far as the plot goes they didnt work enough on the development of the story.<br /><br />Bad : acting low-budget. Good : special effects idea for the movie.<br /><br />Overall this flick deserves 4/10 from me. Its not as bad as people say. Imagine a ZOMBIE WESTERN then watch this movie.',neg
'If Andrei Tarkovsky had been a hack he would have directed Mother and Son instead of Mirror. This is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world I am convinced. A son without a name takes care of his mother without a name. They love each other I guess. No they dont Im sure. These arent characters. They arent even actors playing characters. At least it could be pretty but even the nature seems ridiculously touched up and changed wherever it was necessary with a Macintosh computer. And could Sokurov have come up with a technique as hackneyed as a distorted aspect ration? You would have to have been born yesterday to buy this garbage. 1/10.',neg
'This has to be the best adaptation I have seen its my favourite and I think it stays very close to the book.What really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors.The wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I have seen on screen brooding and tragicwhile Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strengthcourageshyness and gentleness as Jane. The story(as im sure most people know)is thisthe young and plain Jane Eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800s who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers.She is offered the post of governess at the big mansion Thornfield Hall to tutor Adele the young ward of the halls mysterious and respected owner Mr Rochester. As the months go on he falls in love with Jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if Jane is as madly in love with him as he is with her.However there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at Thornfield Hall and when it is its effects are devastating.This is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as I said earlier excellent acting especially from Zelah and Timothy.',pos
'We have to remember that the 50s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies. Hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies noir two reel oaters etc to movies with a message. We had Blackboard Jungle On the Waterfront and so on. Some folks might think that was an improvement. I dont. Who was the mogul who said: If you want to send a message call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy.<br /><br />This one is a pip. Its about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead fathers estate. One of them maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay. Hes initially in it for the bucks but eventually falls for her. Meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance. The results are predictable. You get a little bit of everything in this movie. Sexual tension between the sisters. A little subtle masochism. Hereditary insanity - if there is such a thing. We never get to meet the parents but they must really have been screwed up The cast is practically unknown. One or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar. The acting is so bad its hard to believe. It was released under the United Artists umbrella by a company called Bel-Air Productions. It was shot in and around LA mostly at night and probably without permits. The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene.<br /><br />I cant explain it - not even to myself - but I gave this pile of trash an 8/10. Im familiar with the term Its so bad its good but I dont think I ever ran into the phenomenon before. Well maybe Hot Rods to Hell but this one certainly fits. You might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebodys basement.',pos
'Cocky medical students play chicken with process that simulates death in attempt to get a (hopefully temporary) view of the afterlife. Certain plot twists and themes are a little off the mark and the acting occasionally goes over the top. But the underlying message - about Gods and others forgiveness for our real or perceived sins - is positive and unique in cinema and the cast is very very good. The last sequence between Julia Roberts and her father is so effectively done that years after having seen it I still get chills thinking about it. Highly recommended.',pos
'Director Spike Lee is famous for making films pointing out racism. In many of films such Do The Right Thing most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this movie interracial marriage is the subject with racism once again being the entire issue.<br /><br />What Lee does however is once again demonstrate his bigotry against Christianity. Its amazing the double standards that exist in the film world. If Lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be vilified but Christians? Hey its open season on them.<br /><br />Ossie Davis a reverend in this film shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his Bible. They zoom in on that for another closeup just in case you missed it. Hey folks heres another Bible reader and look what hes like! Lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes.<br /><br />He shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations. Who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing? However Lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films. His obvious bitterness toward white people doesnt help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /><br />Hey Spike: start doing the right thing and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet get over it.<br /><br />This is too bad because the subject matter could have made for a thought- provoking film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.',neg
'Well it is a Monogram quickie from the dreaded period of the 40s when poverty row studios put out a good many horror films that are almost unimaginably dull... So I was expecting the worst. <br /><br />The story concerns a doctor who has been working on a way to restore life to the dead through the use of a room full of non-utilitarian electrical devices which spark nicely. There is a dogs heart hanging under a bell jar and twitching fitfully which we are informed is proof that his method is perfected.<br /><br />A brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and mention of an important plot point precede the inevitable death of a young man who is revived in a rather undramatic sequence - undramatic even with the sparks. The important plot point is that a convicted murderer is being executed just at midnight which turns out to be exactly when the young man is revived. It is no surprise that the young man is very different after his experience; apparently amnesiac and with a strange desire to visit the haunts of the underworld and become acquainted with certain gangsters...<br /><br />Its hard to explain why this all is not completely unwatchable but perhaps it suffices to say that its mildly interesting and contains several murders and a couple of interesting characters. Towards the end it even begins to move along with a bit of real tension and a confrontation that is downright Hitchcockian. SPOILER<br /><br />I have to warn of a very very bad ending. A tagged on unnecessary pain in the ass sorta ending. After the plot resolves rather effectively...<br /><br />You know the sort of thing... Its all a dream. Never happened.',neg
'William Castle is notorious among horror fans as the B-grade director of the 1950s and 60s. His gimmicks his cost-cutting techniques and his unique vision are legendary. It comes as no surprise then that someone (Jeffrey Schwarz whos made countless documentaries) would finally take the time to devote a documentary to his greatness. Such is Spine Tingler: The William Castle Story.<br /><br />I had a general understanding of who Castle was having seen some of his films over the years. I knew nothing about her personal life his goals and ambitions. This film really fleshed out the man and gave me a fuller appreciation for the devotion he had for the craft of film-making and his contributions to the horror genre. The movie depicts Castle as rival to Alfred Hitchcock with Hitch being the artist who wins praise while Castle is the carnival barker who gains cult notoriety but much less respect. He is an icon to all second-rate directors out there which is why its not surprising that John Waters is featured prominently in here. (Joe Dante and Stuart Gordon also have sizable roles.) <br /><br />His gimmicks were what drove his fame and the documentary takes great pains to explain them which is crucial for those who are too young to remember. The rudimentary 3-D of 13 Ghosts (see separate review) the buzzer in the seat for The Tingler (see separate review) money back guarantees for Homicidal... watching these films now outside the theater we can judge them for their content (which personally I still enjoy) but we cannot fully appreciate what audiences once felt.<br /><br />The climax of the film is when Castle goes from cult director to Hollywood producer. Having bought the rights to Rosemarys Baby he is put in a very special place for negotiating its film release. Hoping to direct he is sidelined to producer in order to make way for new director Roman Polanski. While at first disappointed this proves to be one of the best opportunities of his lifetime -- a hugely successful film and a job he excels at. Who better to control the purse of wild artist Polanski than a penny-pinching Castle? This was to be his crowning achievement though sadly the film is more often connected to Polanski than Castle.<br /><br />The remainder of his years are played out and we are given personal reflections by his daughter and niece. Across the board everyone seems to have nothing but praise for the man. Somewhere along the way he surely upset one or two people but you would never know it from this film. And I find that find -- this is a celebration of Bill Castles life not E! True Hollywood Story. Fans of the genre would do well to pick up a copy of this work.<br /><br />I would personally recommend picking up the William Castle Collection which has not only this but eight of Castles films in it with plenty of special features. Even this documentary comes with an audio commentary so you can hear how Schwarz was personally affected by Castle and have Castles daughter Terry giving a running reflection of her experiences with the different films and remakes. Its almost a whole new film.',pos
'A family of dirt-farmers moves out west.<br /><br />The head of Walnut Groves newest motley brood is named Charles. He works at the mill sawing lots of lumber though who in hell he thinks hes cutting all that wood for is a mystery because none of the folks in all of township have enough money to buy a splinter much less a two-by-four.<br /><br />Running the town is the Olsons a rich but stupid clan that relocated to these parts in order to rake in all that dough they make selling eggs for eleven cents a dozen. They have two children a boy Willie and a girl Nellie whom between them have only one saving asset... Nellie is hot and its fun to spy on her when she takes a bath in the crick.<br /><br />The town preacher is also the village idiot because he thinks hes really something special to this backwoods covey of country dillweeds when in reality they cant stand his boring sermons and the only thing they pray for on Sunday is for him to fall off the nearest cliff as soon as possible.<br /><br />The town doctor is a dinosaur who saw his better days about 20 years ago but he hangs around anyway so he can give free breast examinations to the old hags that live in town. Unfortunately the only time these ancient hot mamas get down on their knees is to pull a loaf of bread out of the oven to give to the Doc for his services. But thats OK with Doc because he knows these old wenches give good bread.<br /><br />Bringing up the rear of this colorful collection of country cow-chips is Charles wimpy wife Carolyn and their three girls Mary Carrie and Half-Pint. Mary is another hot chick who all the guys sneak a peek at whenever she takes a shower or a crap. Carrie is an annoying little kid but stick a cookie in her mouth and you wont even know shes there in fact where is she?... oh there she is... shes in the yard playing with a pack of cigarettes... how cute! Half-Pint is the towns youngest screw-up. She may not have a brain or any kind of a body to speak of but she can spit farther then any boy in the whole freaking school.<br /><br />Its a great town Walnut Grove where someone is always falling off a roof or getting run over by a wagon wheel and its beautiful too made up of one building... the church/school-house/town hall/pool room. Ah it gets a little hairy on the prairie but thats OK especially when Mary is taking a bath in the crick... thats when you can see how hairy it really is.',neg
'Plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan. Kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes. <br /><br />A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game. It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact. City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease. A detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles. <br /><br />Streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community. Regardless of outcome you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the films protagonist. <br /><br />Richard Widmark as Dr.Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers. Barbera Bel Geddis as Reeds wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of (restful more than comic) relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the New Orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer Joe McDonald. Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic. Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie (Black Death?) is simply outstanding. With riveting intensity Palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well. In addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity especially in the films powerful final allegorical moments. <br /><br />Panic in the Streets is probably Kazans best non-Brando film. Its tension filled suspensefully well paced and edited. Its ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with Panic he succeeds with aplomb.',pos
'The film is set in Newcastle on Tyne in north east England the town where I was born and grew up. The film is also fundamentally dishonest - the way it presents the town the kids but above all the men of the town. In this film they are all stupid violent thieving thugs.<br /><br />I suppose I could comment on the plot (predictable) the performances (competently unattractive) the direction (lazy and unimaginative) but to me that is all irrelevant compared to the directors insult to the town and its people.<br /><br />Thus the invitation in my summary to the director and writer Mark Herman to leave the north east.',neg
'After a few misfires we are still waiting for THE French horror movie that the critics will certainly vilify but will launch a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline cant be accused of not being knowledgable in the genre (He is editor of a high-class fantasy imprint has worked for legendary magazine Starfix.) but why a scenario that uses EVERY cliché in the book (except maybe the Odious Comic relief) ? Why make it so predictable ? Even the nods towards Argento fails flat. Its not even an euro-teen movie like the German Anatomy much better just a compilation of scenes that barely seems to have any relation one with the other and features LOTS of plot holes. The whole Celtic aspect is barely touched. And after a revenation painfully predictable the screenplay offers us a boring endless chase in a subterranean necropole which seems bigger than Parisian catacombs. I really wanted to love this film. Really. But even a mother would not. Oh and writer Valerio Evangelisti was supposed to have a cameo but I vainly looked for him.',neg
'Simply put Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The movie is less about the raw science of Darwins beliefs and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family primarily his wife Emma and daughter Annie.<br /><br />Toby Jones gives a wonderful turn as Thomas Huxley the great defender of Darwins beliefs and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with Bettany and Connelly.<br /><br />But it is those two who carry the movie. Their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end but develops transcendence as Darwin grapples with his demons. The scene where Darwin relates the ending of the story of Jenny the orangutan to his dying daughter Annie is utterly gripping. The world premiere audience at the TIFF was spellbound. Bettanys performance will be recognized as one of the years best in short order. Equally magnificent is Connellys work playing the religious wife of a man who in Huxleys words killed God.<br /><br />The film moves slowly through the entire spectrum of Darwins grief relishing every detail of Bettany and Connellys acting.<br /><br />Brilliant.',pos

'***Possible Plot Spoilers***<br /><br />I adore Dennis Hopper. I question why he accepted the role of a police detective in 2000s The Spreading Ground. This movie flat out sucks and Im about to tell you why.<br /><br />This is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports arena. One hitch: theres a killer on the loose and that is bad for business. The Mayor makes a deal with the Irish Mob to find the killer and make sure he never makes it to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy caught too but hes on the level and believes in the system. He wants to see the system do its job.<br /><br />That could have been pretty good. It could have been riveting. It was horrible. First they label this guy a Serial Killer. Err no. There are specific criteria and none of it fits here. The bad guy has killed 5 kids the first day and I think it was 2 the second day. This entire movie spans like a 48 hour time period.... Hardly Serial Killer action. I dont care what warped motives they give him in the end Serial Killers do their deed over a long time span. They do not just all of a sudden kill 7 kids in two days. Thats a Spree.<br /><br />Ok that irritant aside the acting was atrocious. The only name here was Hopper and hes the only one who came even close to pulling off his part. Unfortunately hes kinda type-cast to me and I think he does psycho parts much much better. This just wasnt a good vehicle for Hopper. It didnt allow him to do what he does best which is to act all creepy. Its not that he did bad its that Ive seen him do so much better.<br /><br />The Irish Mob guy Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - Long Days Journey Into Night) who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff. Contradiction? Not really. He is trying to play the cold hard kinda guy and he does that to the point that the character is just wooden. Boring to the max. He didnt scare me. He didnt inspire any emotion at all except boredom. I cannot tell you how many times I checked to see how much longer it was til the end of this movie.<br /><br />The other thing about this is that it had the feel of a made-for-TV movie. You know what I mean. The poor production values low budget re-use of scenes to save costs. Just eh. Yanno? But I feel like comparing this to those is an insult to those.<br /><br />Derek Vanlint was both the Director and Cinematographer on this project. He bit off more than he could chew. I cant help feeling that Hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend. Thats the only rational I can come up with. This was Vanlints first job as Director third as cinematographer. Hopefully this was a learning experience for him.<br /><br />I wont ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one but I do want to say that they all dropped the ball here...even Hopper. In a scene that should have been emotionally gut-wrenching for the detective it was just..well.. blah. I didnt see any of the angst at all that would accompany the total gear-change this guy made. Very disappointing.<br /><br />This 100 grueling minutes long and Rated R for violence and language. No kid under 13 is going to have any interest whatsoever in watching this so no worries there. Its not suitable for anyone anyway. heh.<br /><br />Skip this one. Youll thank me later.',neg

'This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange in her first starring role Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau. Hard to believe that anyone could reject this beauty for any reason but Louis Jourdan her heart throb does just this. Sort of takes you back to Paul Neuman rejecting the gorgeous Elizabth Taylor in CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF doesnt it? Diane Baker the third damsel in distress meets and dates Robert Evans before he became the producer and husband to Ali MacGraw he is known for. Hopes boyfriend from home played by newcomer Brett Halsey is promising to marry her. She also meets Stephen Boyd a fellow worker who has interests in our Hope. All three ladies have their drama ahead of them. Crawford almost steals the film. Her presence and her usual strong bitchy self is fun to watch. Veteran actor Brian Aherne plays one of the bosses with a yen for pinching our leading ladies back side. Hes delightfully charming. Also in the cast is Martha Hyer wasted in a thankless role never really explored. Too bad as I like this actress who never seems to get that one role to distinguish her abilities. She has a crush on a married man in the office played by Donald Harron whom I had the pleasure to work with in a couple of Shakespeare plays in NYC.

'This movie is truly unbelievable in every sense of the word. I couldnt believe what I was seeing and hearing and I didnt believe it anyhow. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress but this was ridiculous. Being a hillbilly myself I know what it should sound like and its not Kates Back Bay accent. The only thing I found funnier was the fact that the guy who played Charlie Chan so many times Sydney Toler was cast as another one of the hillbillies with accent to match. Maybe this was a practical joke come to think of it. I can think of no other reason for such peculiar casting. Well maybe this. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer Lovey Howell on Gilligans Island appeared in this play on Broadway. Can you imagine what part she might have played?',neg
'I saw this movie once and I thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said Watch it again its better. So I did. And to my surprise it was WORSE on the second time! Theres a word limit so Im going to get the ball rolling here.<br /><br />-The bombing scenes were all so stupid. Why on earth would anyone WAIT to trigger the explosion??? -None of the characters here are even remotely likable. Not on the first time not even the second.<br /><br />-Oh and last time I checked a car does not explode from a single gun shot nor can a fire THAT huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher... did the above 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie??? -The camera is so shaky I can barely tell what is going on. That opening scene with the robot had my stomach off-put the rest of the movie was not much better.<br /><br />-The sniper scene. The McManus Brothers (from The Boondock Saints) would roll their eyes it was so stupid. First off why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot? Furthermore why would he spend THAT much time cleaning the bullets reloading aiming and NOT get shot when there was so much chaos going on around him? -SAS types RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back?????? Huh????? Are the soldiers... gay...??? I didnt mean to sound homophobic but honestly that scene was so ridiculous.<br /><br />-Too long for its own good yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it. Bigelow seems to think that the more action the better. Looks like she is wrong- the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot. I know Watchmen is longer at 163 minutes but at least that movie didnt drag. This movie on the other hand does and for it feels longer.<br /><br />The only good thing was Renner who was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favour just skip this and dont give into the hype.',neg
'In terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding! I had no idea that Technicolor came out so early. Although I didnt like the ending the entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that I was in North Africa. The cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and I just loved her in this flick. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. I couldnt get over the scenery and the sets... The hotel the palm trees the desert its all there... the legionnaires also bring a Beau Geste feeling to the film. They certainly dont make movies like these anymore. Dont fail to watch this classic!',pos
'I went out of my way to get this film and was fortunate to get it on VHS. Being a big Gloria Grahame fan it was an excellent addition to my collection. Other than that I really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department. Ms. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her as I do) but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot. She works in a dive so let her use her own voice. It can only lend to the atmosphere. I must agree with an earlier reviewer; the ending borrows heavily from THE BIG HEAT. To the point of detracting from the ending. I have seen worse films with Ms. Grahame (MACAO) but I will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen. If you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film this is your movie. Enjoy the picture.',neg
'Written by directed by and starring the champ of camp Bruce Campbell. Easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair; filmed independently in Bulgaria. All I can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny. Campbell plays an affluent American business man with a cheating wife(Antoinette Byron)and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered. He hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town; not knowing that his wife is carrying on with the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell being bludgeoned; the cabbie is killed in the same location. A mad scientist(Stacy Keach)proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbies brain inside the Americans head. With massive stitches on his forehead Campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife; all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over-sized head. Campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself. Thus Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased. I get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy. Rounding out the cast are Ted Raimi Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev. Watch for this on the Sci-Fi Channel.',neg
'Beware My Lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /><br />Production: The Filmmakers/RKO Radio Pictures<br /><br />Credulity-straining thriller from the pioneering producer team of Collier Young and Ida Lupino aka The Filmmakers (with Lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction). <br /><br />Robert Ryan is the peril and Ida Lupino is the woman in this entry in the woman in peril style film. Ryan plays Howard Wilton a tightly-wound psychotic handyman drifter (noooo Ryan? I know hard to believe). Lupino is the lonely war widow Helen Gordon who hires Howard to do some work around her house. Things go downhill from there as Howard makes Helen a prisoner in her own home. <br /><br />Howard has a nasty secret not that he could reveal it. You see consciousness is a real challenge for him. Maintaining it that is. He has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead. This is part of the films problem. The nature of Howards psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that hes been free to roam from town to town unobstructed even in the year 1918 (when the film is set). He cant remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. His violent threatening anti-social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things (a young girl flirting inadequacies involving the war due to his being rejected for service). I dont know how he even made it past the interview with Helen. There are other implausibilities. If you were locked in your house with a madman but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time couldnt you figure out a way to escape? <br /><br />Ryan I think is defeated by the material. It feels like hes overplaying his hand. His series of tics and spasms and the tightly coiled bursts of dementia all have a been-there done-that robotic feel to them. At this point in his career hed probably played this character to some degree ten times and it shows. We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (I didnt) through shown bits of humanity like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who wont judge him. Lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress which she is more than capable of and does. <br /><br />The picture had one thing going for it; what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict? So naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective. <br /><br />Of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch Howards reflection (in mirrors water Christmas tree decorations). This indicated something going on or about to go on in his head. Horner (1953s Vicki) who made his reputation in production design does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison. Credit too the always reliable RKO art department for the work on the house. In the end sub-standard work from the principals who all have much better films to their credit. <br /><br />*½ out of 4',neg

'] Havent seen this film? Havent even heard of this film? It wouldnt surprise me. One of the few truly independent films produced in the last ten years no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution. The independent company Kino Films gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited run with virtually no promotion and the majority of major film critics didnt even bother reviewing it. I guess a movie based on a one act one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in todays market - and its the intelligent film-lovers loss.<br /><br />For the record both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved Ocsar nominations (as did the cinematographer) but the film received such little fanfare that I cant even blame the academy on that one. This is a film that is challenging thought-provoking and heartbreaking and it actually requires the audience to meet it on its own terms. Taking that into consideration it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment. Director John Berry wisely does not attempt to dress-up Athol Fugards play. Sure were given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENA remains on the whole a story of two people living in inhumane conditions.<br /><br />Stripped of their basic human rights Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one left to attack but each other. A third character joins them for awhile (Willie Jonah amazing in a largely silent role) but the films focus never strays from the title characters and what theyve become. Bassett and Glover give brave performances as the broken couple performances that simply could not be improved upon. Vigorously and brutally stimulating both intellectually and emotionally BOESMAN AND LENA deserves to be rediscovered of home video. Hands down the best film of the year 2000.',pos
'The anime that got me hooked on anime...<br /><br />Set in the year 2010 (hey thats not too far away now!) the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence. Seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists the government of the fictional New Port City form the Tank Police to deal with the problem - cops with tanks! Oh the insanity!<br /><br />The heroes of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki a red haired Japanese woman (yeah I know they never match their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance) who has just been drafted into the Tank Police and is quickly partnered with blond blue eyed nice guy Al. Leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain (also known as Brenten) a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses a big revolver and a bad temper. Britain didnt like having Leona join the Tank Police in the first place and her wrecking his Tiger Special (a giant green monster tank) doesnt exactly endear her to him nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames Bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it. Theres also Specs the bifocal genius Bible quoting/God fearing Chaplain purple MO-hawked Mohican and the pot bellied Chief whos right on the edge thanks to the Mayor always yelling at him about the Tank Police antics. Seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them theyre not very well liked by the people.<br /><br />The villains are a cyborg named Buaku whos got a mysterious past thats connected with a project known as Green Peace his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks Anna & Uni Puma. In the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who havent been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd theyre hired to steal a painting that is of a naked Buaku. The story however was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic (Manga) book thats very hard to find.<br /><br />All sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred. This is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it youd better go get Quentin Tarantino. Uneven in places but still a lot of fun.<br /><br />Followed by New Dominion: Tank Police.',pos
'This is arguably John Thaws finest performance where he successfully shakes off any traits of his Inspector Morse character and brings a perfect adaptation of Tom from the pages of the book to the TV screen. This is a well made production which maintains its family viewing vibe despite some very mature themes like the outbreak of the second world war and the physical abuse suffered by the child.<br /><br />However it is the relationship between Tom and young Willie that is the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy evacuated from London and the grumpy old man he is left with develop - a real grandfather/grandson connection.<br /><br />It is a pity that this story wasnt made with a bigger budget with a more established director as it belongs on the big screen not shown once or twice every ten years on a Sunday afternoon. Given the right guidance John Thaw would be celebrated the world over and bestowed with many awards for his brilliant performance in this movie. A great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at the time.',pos
'I cant recommend this film as a date movie. Gary Oldmans semi-autobiographical account of life lived on a South East London estate is a violent Beckettian account of one of Dantes circles of hell frankly. At the centre of it is Ray Winstone who has done this sort of character before but never as well. The film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar - thats all - and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration self-loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie. Its an acting masterclass.<br /><br />Of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and Winstone is matched by Kathy Burke as his long-suffering wife who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour. Charlie Creed-Miles does an able turn as the fuse-lighting druggie son Billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for. Gary Oldman directs close up on the actors maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor. 4/10',neg
'I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989. I enjoyed it then and I still do now. But what I realize now is that this is quite adult for a film with a G rating especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together and Reynolds singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog. There are some good songs ranging from upbeat (Lets Make Music Together) to downright emotional (Home to My Heart). I found the plot good although it does go off on a tangent once or twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest Ive ever seen in animation. A film worth experiencing.',pos
'Life is comprised of infinite possibilities; some known others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what of the vast unknown the realms beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters? Who is to say what exists or what is possible? Valid questions all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individuals personal journey a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic in `K-PAX directed by Iain Softley and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. In the wake of an incident in New Yorks Central Station a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan where he is delivered into the care of Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges) who attempts to uncover the truth about his patient who claims to be from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell as Prot with his calm direct forthcoming manner and a propensity for produce (he eats bananas peels and all and Red Delicious Apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. But its Powells job as well as his nature to be skeptical. Prots claims however remain intact and stand up even under the most intense probing and the watchful eye of Dr. Powell who finds himself in something of a quandary-- Prot even tells him the exact date and time that he will depart for K-PAX a scheduled return trip that allows Powell but a short time to sort it all out. And Powell just cant seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being; and its something he is going to have to resolve quickly if he is ever going to know the truth. And he has to know. The truth after all is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind.<br /><br />\tSoftley has created and delivered a sensitive thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery surrounding Prot while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is in fact possible. And as you never know for sure about Prot until the denouement you are able to identify with Powell seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle right along with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that Prot just may be what he says he is. And in the context of the reality to which the film is disposed its an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around. How do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations weve set for ourselves? While at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident not only in Prot but in Dr. Powell as well. All of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama.<br /><br />\tAs weve come to expect Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Prot presenting his character from the inside out emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. This is a unique individual and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself. For this film to work it is essential that we believe who and what Prot is; we do and it does. Spacey simply pulls it off magnificently. Its a memorable performance from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long long time.<br /><br />\tJeff Bridges meanwhile emerges on equal footing with Spacey adeptly making a very real person of Dr. Powell. Its a fairly straightforward role and the challenge for Bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right which opposite the character of Prot was no small task. And again for this film to work it was necessary for Bridges to rise to the occasion. And with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is he succeeds without question. Bridges infuses Powell with an underlying complexity and is so giving in his performance that it makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant and at times intense. Its a demonstration of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring. Its a great job by Bridges who never attempts to steal the spotlight from Prot which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch.<br /><br />\tThe supporting cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel) Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers) Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu) Vincent Laresca (Navarro) Kimberly Scott (Joyce) Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). An entertaining emotionally involving film `K-PAX is a dissertation on possibilities as well as an examination of the ever evolving complexities of the human condition. Its a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on its own terms and embrace it. In the end it makes you realize just how real K-PAX is; and it makes you appreciate Prots journey and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us human or alien. And it may just make you reflect upon your own journey-- where youve been and where youre going. And thats the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10. <br /><br />',pos
'Two Soldiers is an excellent example of fine film-making. The director and producer took a heart-warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast excellent cinematography and very creative artistry.<br /><br />The relaxed back-woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into. The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back-woods of North Carolina and an even harder life of war.<br /><br />The acting was great particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr) to the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the powerful perfomrance by the Colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was extremely well cast.<br /><br />It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers and I heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages.',pos
'As the first of the TV specials offered on the elaborate box set Barbra Streisand: The Television Specials released last November this disc is being released separately for those who do not want to fork over the dollars for all five specials. As an investment this is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is Streisand at her purest and most eager to impress. That she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend. Signed to a long-term contract with CBS to produce hour-long variety shows an almost extinct format nowadays Streisand was all of 22 in this CBS special first broadcast in April 1965. At that point of her career her notoriety was limited to a handful of best-selling albums a few dazzling TV appearances on variety and talk shows and her successful Broadway run in Funny Girl.<br /><br />Filmed in crisp black-and-white the program is divided into three distinct parts. With the creative transitional use of Im Late from Disneys Alice in Wonderland the first segment cleverly shows her growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as Make Believe and Im Five. Opening with a comic monologue about Pearl from Istanbul the second part moves on location to Manhattans chic Bergdorf Goodmans where she is elegantly costumed in a series of glamorous outfits while singing Depression-era songs like Ive Got Plenty of Nuthin and The Best Things in Life Are Free with comic irony. Back to basics the third segment is a straight-ahead concert which opens with a torchy version of When the Sun Comes Out includes a Funny Girl medley and ends with her classic melancholic take on Happy Days Are Here Again over the ending credits. Also included is the brief introduction she taped in 1986 when the special was first released on VHS. For those who know Streisand only for her pricey concert tickets and political fundraising this is a genuine eye-opener into why she is so revered now.',pos

'Demi and Woody are married but theyre poor. They meet Robert Redford and hes REALLY rich. He takes a fancy to Demi and since hes a gambling man he makes the couple an indecent proposal: one million dollars for a night with the little woman.<br /><br />At this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep. Of course Demi is going to accept the offer. If she doesnt theres no first half of the movie. Of course it will affect Demi and Woodys marriage. If it doesnt theres no second half of the movie. And of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll. If it doesnt theres no happy ending for the sake of box office.<br /><br />The absolute best thing you can say about INDECENT PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore looks good in a black dress. As for the rest... The script is incompetent the direction amateurish the performances negligible. I suspect Redford Moore and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned. Do them--and more importantly yourself--a favor. Unless some one offers you a million... Miss It!<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer',neg

Its not that scary its overly melodramatic and it draaaaaags. Every time I thought Oh HERE comes the good part the good part never quite arrived.<br /><br />The Evil Ones arent at all convincing. Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth.<br /><br />Perhaps if Id been in the proper frame of mind I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fication at this films expense but.... Naaahhh...

'Obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well. George Lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his Star Wars series seems to a homage to Gunga Din. The characters that Grant McLaglen and Fairbanks play are just precursors of Han Solo Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Sam Jaffes Gunga Din morphed into C-3PO and R2-D2 and like him or not: Jar Jar Binks.<br /><br />Today this film is viewed as non PC but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru the leader of the Indian opposition to the British raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today. <br /><br />To a young boy this was a great film. Three strong male leads and only a hint of romance. There was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in Saturday matinee film was just mush. Not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight. Too late to lament lost innocence.<br /><br />Hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at TCM and catch a film with action adventure and a cast of thousands instead of CGI actors.',pos
'Like most other reviewers I really enjoyed this TV miniseries. I didnt see it when it first came out but my grandfather - a big fan of mysteries and war films - happened to record it in 1989. I remember watching it at my grandparents cabin one night and I was completely drawn into the story! It has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama romance and espionage. Ive seen lots of films that are set during WWII but none with a twist like this! Thankfully I was able to make a VHS copy of the film several years ago. Ive watched it several times since then and I still enjoy it. I would love for this film to be released on DVD. It would be so much easier to view with chapters.',pos

Jimmy Page obviously cant live with quiet music I guess. I do must say though that during the concert at Royal Albert Hall they expanded How many more times and Moby Dick too long. Other than that it was exquisit. My favorite song of all time is now on that DVD. Trampled Underfoot. Its either that one or In my time of dying. In that song Jimmy really plays that thing good. Ever seen Randy Rhoads play? Well Jimmy plays just like him except his guitar is lower.',pos
'I kept waiting for this film to improve but alack this is the worst kind of escapist movie: a spun-sugar confection that sinks under the weight of its own ponderous self-importance. The pace stumbles on like a legionnaire stranded in the Sahara. The absence of good dialogue leaves the appealing stars with little to do other than look good in white linen. Irons plays yet another moneyed charmer whos had a touch of the sun. Kaas is a pleasing singer but not much of an actress. Luckily the script does not often call on her to emote away from the jazz club microphone. All the enviably relaxed pretty unnecessary characters take turns masticating the scenery with an air of weary sophistication. The whole exercise comes across like an interminably long Ralph Lauren ad. <br /><br />If youre past forty and believe Francophilia is the key to sophistication you may well mistake this piece of cardboard for a baguette. Well if you liked this movie you probably felt smart for appreciating Godards leaden Éloge de lamour and you may even have sat through Le Divorce without cringing.',neg

'Mind-numbingly boring utterly predictable and in the end simply laughable. That pretty much sums up the disaster that is Indecent Proposal. Starting with a decent premise the whole thing just unravels and becomes a complete mess. Basically the story boils down to the question would you let your wife sleep with another man for one million dollars? Here of course the answer is yes because otherwise we wouldnt have a movie. Quite frankly wed have been better off if we didnt have a movie.<br /><br />Our married (and financially troubled) couple are played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yeah thatll work. Anyhow a billionaire played by Robert Redford takes a liking to the wife and makes the million dollar offer. For one night with the wife he will give them financial security. The aftermath of that one night is what the movie is really all about. Unfortunately nothing in that aftermath is the least bit entertaining. The script is so predictable you can say the characters lines before they do. The performances leave much to be desired. Harrelson would be better off sticking to comedies as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark. Anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying. And it is quite safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to clear space in her home for any Academy Awards. Why is she a movie star again? In a part that should be full of emotion she conveys none. Only Redford escapes mostly unscathed. Hes appropriately slimy yet suave and clearly the best actor of the bunch. But he cant save this film. Awful script lousy acting plodding pace zero entertainment...Indecent Proposal is downright awful.',neg

It is so with the world. At present you are full of power. But youre spilling it wastefully. And Islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket. <br /><br />Raisuli: The English have paid very well in the past. Pedecaris: Well youll not have your way with the Americans. President Roosevelt will have your head for this. Raisuli: Roosevelt. This President Roosevelt--he would try and take it himself? Pedecaris: He certainly would! He is a man of grit and strong moral fiber. He does not kidnap women and children! Raisuli: What kind of rifle does he use? Pedecaris: A Winchester! Raisuli: Winchester. Winchester. I have no knowledge of this rifle. Pedecaris: You will. <br /><br />Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): The American Grizzly Bear is a symbol of the American character: strength intelligence ferocity. A little blind and reckless at times but courageous beyond all doubt. Oh and one other trait goes with all previous. Newspaper reporter: And that Mr. President? Teddy Roosevelt: Loneliness. The bear lives out his life alone. Indomitable. Unconquered. But always alone. He has no real allies only enemies--but none of them are as great as he. Newspaper reporter: You feel this might be an American trait? Teddy Roosevelt: Certainly. The world would never love us. It may respect us. It may even grow to fear us. But itll never love us. For we have too much audacity. And were a bit blind and reckless at times too.',pos

Great liberties are taken with facts here and we are presented with a Custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates.

I want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray. We dont get that enough anymore. AWESOME JOB!!!',pos
'I clicked onto the Encore Mystery channel to wait for the movie I wanted to see Island of Dr. Moreau. I caught only a few minutes of Shadow Conspiracy. An old man runs to meet Charlie and grabs him by the arm. Suddenly an Assassin in a bright rain coat taps the old man in the head (with a side arm) from across the street. After waiting for C to turn around and look the A tries to shoot C and clearly misses. C was a much easier target the old man couldnt have run far. Duh! There is a chase and C is on an elevator A is on the roof so he tries to shoot the cable which is parallel to the A. He hits and severs the cable impossible. Later this time with a specialized rifle the A lines up on C from maybe 50 meters but is to stupid to notice a motorcycle coming up and taps the rider instead. How does Charlie get his parts? Does Daddy go to the producers and say Look my kid needs work... It reminds me of his stupid Sit - Com. All the actors are good except yup ... you got it. I usually have to endue 2 or 3 minutes of that waiting for C.S.I. to come on. Lets see what can I do for the next hour. I know Ill trim my toenails! Much better use of my time.',neg
'A DAMN GOOD MOVIE! One that is seriously underrated. The songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain but also their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg puts in a good performance here but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character. I wish she was in more movies.<br /><br />This movie should have a higher rating. I give it a 10/10.',pos
'Have you ever found yourself watching a film or documentary and having to hold yourself back from screaming things like No! Dont do it!? No? Well its time you do. And undoubtedly DEEP WATER is the one to get you started.<br /><br />The story is based on that of Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the first round-the-world yacht race to be undertaken by individuals in 1968. That word individuals is important as the men who set off on this nearly suicidal escapade head out alone.<br /><br />Most of the men are well-knowns in the sea-faring communities of England (where they launch from) but one of them is the unknown dark horse and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Struggling financially Crowhurst enlists a backer who can take everything from him should he fail to at least attempt to make it through a large portion of the race. He could take his home his property everything.<br /><br />Crowhurst now finds himself between a rock and ...well ...deep water: either attempt the race with an unproven ship and an unproven captain or lose everything you own (which was significant since Crowhurst had a wife and several children). Youll note the term unproven captain in there too. Not only was he unproven hed never been out on the open sea! Did I mention suicidal? Flicking between archival footage of the pre- and post-race and those of Crowhursts friends family and acquaintances of today Deep Water is put together masterfully. Initially seen as a poor sap who got in over his head the film gradually shows you the limited choices Crowhurst had after months and months out on the water. His ship leaks. Equipment breaks. Psyche stretched to the breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal struggle with no successful way out. It is interesting too to see the psychological breaks that other racers have as they deal with their solitary confinement on-board their respective boats.<br /><br />The wave-like emotions that youll feel as you watch this astounding documentary may make you a bit ill (not unlike trying to get your sea-legs). And youll probably be frustrated at the choices being made; perhaps just as frustrated as poor Mr. Crowhurst.<br /><br />The ending is also amazing in that we get to see the actual ship that Crowhurst sailed sitting deserted and rotting on a Caribbean beach ...not unlike other things that felt deserted and rotting toward the end of this poorly thought-out race.<br /><br />Incredible.',pos
'After a string of successful a man and his monkey films which included the seminal Every Which Way But Loose Every Which Way You Can and Peters Friends the genre fell on hard times. In an effort to rejuvenate this once celebrated area director Frank Marshall brought Michael Crichtons acclaimed novel to the big screen.<br /><br />Think Gorillas in the Mist meets Tron minus the box-office clout of Bruce Boxleitner. This is one mans doomed love affair for his talking monkey. Not helped by bad accents (Tim Curry struggles with a Romanian) a baboon of a screenplay hungry hippos skydiving primates and Bruce Campbell. Ape-Sh*t.',neg

'I had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what in my opinion is this shockingly bad film. It fails on pretty much all levels; the cast is awful the acting - ham at best and the plot lacks any depth leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines.<br /><br />Plan B has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and I found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy.<br /><br />A bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie.',neg
'When I first heard about the show I heard a lot about it and it was getting some good reviews. I watched the first episode of this forensic fairy tale as it so proclaims itself and I really got hooked on it. I have loved it since. This show has a good sense of humour and its fun to see a good show like this. The cast is excellent as their characters and I wouldnt want to change them in any way.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with this show Pushing Daisies centers around a man named Ned (aka The Pie Maker played by Lee Pace) who discovered a special gift when he was a boy: He could bring the dead back to life with the touch of a finger. He first did so with his dog Digby. However there is the catch: If he keeps a dead person alive for more than one minute someone else dies. He learned this when he brought his mother back to life and his childhood crushs father died in Neds mothers place. The other catch is if he touches the person again theyre dead again but this time for good. He learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight. His father took him to boarding school and when he left Ned never saw his father again.<br /><br />Almost 20 years later Ned owns a pie bakery cleverly titled The Pie Hole. A co-worker of Neds Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth) has a crush on Ned but Ned rejects her moves trying not to get close to anyone learning from past experiences. Private Investigator Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) discovered the gift that Ned has and decides to make him a partner in solving murders. Ned touches the victim asks who killed them and when the minute is up he touches them again and they solve it. Thats how they usually solve it. Throughout the episodes the murders have very interesting plots and be what people least expect.<br /><br />One day Ned discovers that his next murder to solve is his childhood sweetheart Charlotte Chuck Charles (Anna Friel). He brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive. In her place the funeral director who stole jewelery from the corpses died. When Emerson finds out and when Chuck wants to help with solving the murders he doesnt agree a bit--for a while we hear him call Chuck Dead girl. This is all kept in secret from Olive Chucks aunts Vivian and Lily (Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz respectively) and everyone else for that matter in case anyone recognized her from obituaries the news etc. Vivian and Lily formerly synchronized swimmers hadnt left the house in years. Emerson Ned and Chuck agree to work together. Ned and Chuck grow to love each other though they cant touch each other ever again.<br /><br />This show is funny has terrific characters contains great plot twists and will definitely get your spirits up. I hope it doesnt get cancelled at 13 episodes.',pos
'Just saw the film tonight in a preview and its a film for kids only. It does not improve or add to the original Disney film in any way. There is a corny Scottish pastiche style throughout not helped by weak writing (where motives are lumped in by the spadeful) and acting that is uneven and often unengaging (despite what reads like a decent cast). I have no problem with the wee dog - although there is a certain Skippy the Bush Kangaroo (see below) quality about his shots.<br /><br />* For those that dont know Skippy was an Australian kids TV series from the 1960s where the kangaroo would be an essential part of all the stories. It is said that to get poor old Skippy to act they stuck an elastic band round his muzzle that he then tried to get off with his paws - sort of appearing to be communicating with the human actors!!! Bobby has a similar range and you just dont buy his series of heroic rescues at all.<br /><br />Advice would be to take kids aged 8-12. Below that they might be scared. Above that if they or you love it good luck to you but this is strictly cardboard cut-out film-making for the undemanding. Its a missed opportunity since there is real pathos and cuteness in the story of Bobby and this film fails to deliver it.',neg
'Spectacular Horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it. The atmosphere is very creepy and stylish the score is chilling but the best about the movie is its performances. Its rare to get scared by performances and this movies solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor.<br /><br />The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes. Though the woman in black does not have much screen time she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes. The dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and thats when it becomes really scary. <br /><br />If you have the chance watch this on theater its a totally different experience but as scary as this movie.<br /><br />This is one of the best Ghost movies ever and its directed for people that want to get scared.',pos
'In my eyes this is almost the perfect example of Hollywood ego only beaten by the new king kong movie. Superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman Ive ever seen from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat. He looks just silly wearing the costume. But enough about him Kate Bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW He is actually supermans son who would have ever thought....) and the acting was horrible. This movie has one good thing going for it and its name is Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie. What this movie needed was the cast of lois and clark (except Kevin Spacey of course) and a different story. I watched this movie after watching the hills have eyes and I was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that.',neg
'1st watched 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Mick Garris): Campy vampire-like Stephen King movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3/4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for King fans. Its the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers(a shape-shifting feline-like flesh eating life needing near extinct breed of humanoid) who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive. They come across as pretty normal upper-class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home day and night. Cats are deadly to them so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down. We get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack(which is also a first in my movie-going experience) --- hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film. The boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a sleepwalker and then he just wants her body. There is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all-out satirical comedy on suburban life but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish hed just get over it and bring out the gore. Eventually that happens and the movie winds down to its typical Stephen King downbeat ending. The movie is interesting because Kings humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesnt cut it.',neg
'What was this supposed to be? A remake of Fisher King? Why do we care about Sandlers character? What a slow dreary boring who-gives-a-damn-about-these-people movie!!! Just simply painful to sit through I turned it off before it was over. Its so obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler; like I said: can you say Fisher King? And how does this psychotic character function in his daily life? We arent supposed to think that deeply I guess. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to turn violent on him? If they were such good friends how did they grow apart? If Cheadle is so in control why does he keep seeking the advice of the shrink on the street? We are never told. Thats why Fisher King was a better film on so many levels and why this just sucks. Nearly 8 out of 10 average score? I dont agree. At all. Even the top films are lucky to get such a high average rating and this crap doesnt deserve to be in the same universe with them.',neg
'In a farcical key Gaudí Afternoons can be taken as a mediocre exercise. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis pivoted a good cast (Juliette Lewis new-age freaky character has been incredibly taken from reality I know an American young lady who squawks like her!!) but GA does not show much beyond its overtoned plot.<br /><br />Even though movie-making is all about make believe there were certain noticeable screenplay inconsistencies. Two samples: you pay 14 euro to enter the chapel where Cassandra and Frankie met NEVER at 7 am and you cannot leave a terrace without paying the bill (theyll charge you on the spot if they dont know you) or get off a taxi THAT quickly (you Americans always tip cabbies even though they dont expect to but the sequences portrayed in the movie were ridiculous). Dont believe me reader: come over and see for yourself.<br /><br />If youve never been here before you might not care about all this but good movies should be believable disregarding of your origin. Nobody knows about GA here and I will make sure that does not change in the future.',neg
'After three hours in the Cinema hallthe strongest impression garnered was that their is something amiss. What was clear was that the Directors forgot to direct the actors to act and most importantly the script writer to write. Evervbody shouted without reason and made one cringe. The script moved on and on with lots of avoidable twists and turns ending in now too familiar Priyadarshan theory of Converging actors at a single point. This theory worked well in Hera-Pheri and Hungama but somehow managed to irritate this time so did the habit of every actors incapacity to answer asked of them directly. Simplest questions such as  what is your name would be repeated N times.<br /><br />Finally what was amiss was that the director forgot that his audience have something called intelligence.',neg
'I thought this was an awesome movie. The theme song is sweet! :) Anyway the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning when everything should have been normal. It was very weird and unrealistic. The big cable company is mainly what Im talking about. Apart from that the movie was very creative. I think that all the acting was well done the actors acted out their characters personalities perfectly. Everything fit together well. It really is a shame that their isnt a soundtrack. That would have been great! Because this is a Canadian film and because it is one of my favorites I give this movie a 10 out of 10!',pos

Marx) of all human emotions anxiety is the only one that is not deceiving. The whole is bracketed by an intro that declares you dont look for your desires in movies instead cinema tells you what you should desire and concludes with the cineaste view that cinema is needed today so that we can understand our current reality -- I say as long as censorship doesnt derail it.<br /><br />The three part subdivision is merely mechanical possibly with TV screening in mind.

'It is interesting to see what people think of this movie since it is in fact quite unique (though it bears some of the trademarks of Clive Barkers writing). Even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard Hollywood plot hooks and layered so that if you expect to be fed you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot.<br /><br />Those who need a linear specific and untangled plot line will hate this movie because the story lies like in the novella partially between the lines or in this case partially off screen in comments and the imagination.<br /><br />Another possible hang-up is the ending of which I can say without spoiling it that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad. It is in fact not very defined at all which I know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didnt get to know what happened but to me and to many others Im sure just adds another dimension to the story - the dimension of speculation and in addition the point that great disruption has a tendency to cause ripples that extend quite far.<br /><br />There is definitely moral here but of a rather different kind than the standard Hollywood in-your-face-at-the-end-of-the-movie sort of display. Summing that moral up is simple even though it is not quite that simply displayed; prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different.<br /><br />I love this movie even though as many of the reviewers have noted the expressions of the actors (with the exception of David Cronenberg who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky. Im not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth though seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay.<br /><br />All in all this is a great movie provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie.',pos

'This is one of the best TV productions of a musical ever. I have heard the Merman cast album the Angela Lansbury album I have seen Tyne Daly live and Ive seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless times. I think Bette is if not the best then tied with the best. She captures not just the bravura but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I was never a Natalie Wood fan so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb in what is arguably her best role. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful. The three strippers led by the always-dependable Christine Ebersole are hard to top. There was supposed to be a TV production of Mame a few years back with Cher but I think Bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for Auntie Mame.',pos

'This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didnt craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition. Real poetry real humor real tenderness real drama real beauty. No rhetoric no easy surreal shortcuts no typical touristic Tornatore-like picturing no over acting no director autoreferentialism. There is also a cool use of two heartbreaking Nina Simones songs whose music I reckon has never been used in a proper way for a score. So if this will not be a real reviveing for the Italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for Emanuele Crialese after his Respiro another definitive beautiful film. Nuovomondo is not to be missed it is that kind of medicine film helpful to enjoy movie-making movie watching helpful to enjoy and understand life. Francesco Cabras',pos
'Okay I absolutely LOVE Ben Stiller although I am lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can act in the least. Every movie or sitcom Ive seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting. It sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script. This movie only had one good thing about it and thats that Ben Stiller was in it. This plot is so used and abused its ridiculous. How many movies have this same type of plot?? Can we say Forces of Nature?? Not only is the plot so old but the outcome is so predictable its boring. I knew everything that was going to happen before it did. It was a bore but watching Stiller is always a delight!!!',neg
'The film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity. Has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked? It looks like the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include some (if not a lot) of nudity of the local stars together with slang which otherwise in the nowadays Portuguese society is repulsed with horror. If you watch advertising for Portuguese films at Portuguese TVs they all have included a hot scene from the movie. Im not saying by any means that Portuguese society is alienated; just that the movie industry does not seem capable of finding others ways of success. Going back to the movie... There is nothing left from the spirit of the book which is a masterpiece. The film could have been a good one had there been emphasized the real idea of the book (of actuality at any time) and not the strictly erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients... but the chef was awful...',neg

'Soylent Green IS...a really good movie actually.<br /><br />I never wouldve thought it. I dont really like Heston in his sci-fi efforts. Hes one of those actors who like Superman manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And indeed he sneers his way through much of Soylent Green too but as hes supposed to be playing an overconfident bully I dont really mind.<br /><br />I can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie. Soylent Green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - it looks just like 1973) and its lacking in action. But I admired the films vision of a complex corrupt and highly stratified society and I was so pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving funny final role. Nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with Heston - really make the movie.<br /><br />The message of Soylent Green is pretty relevant these days when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to. Funny isnt it to see Heston in a prototype Michael Moore movie...',pos
'Ive read all the Dave Robicheaux novels and consider James Lee Burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer. Ive also visited New Iberia and much of Acadiana to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books. Needless to say I greatly anticipated seeing In the Electric Mist especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be terrific as Robicheaux.<br /><br />I was greatly disappointed. The story was very choppy; the interplay with the ghosts of Confederate dead was shallow and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was doleful expressionless and difficult to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my ditto to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old made-for-TV movies. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show up at any time.<br /><br />The location settings were accurate and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy bayous smoky juke joints and eerie above-ground graveyards of South Louisiana. Too bad the storys disjointed presentation and Tommy Lees sub-par performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of the region.<br /><br />Next to final comment: In the novels Dave Robicheauxs nickname is Streak because of the distinct streak of silver-gray hair on one side of his head. (Similar to how the Sopranos Paulie Walnuts would appear if he were seen only in profile.) Tommy Lee had no such streak in this film probably because the editors are James Lee Burke fans and they airbrushed the streak out after witnessing Mr. Joness poor imitation of Dave Robicheaux.<br /><br />Final comment: While I generally find Alec Baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles he was by far a better Robicheaux in Heavens Prisoners than Tommy Lee was in In the Electric Mist. Also Heavens Prisoners is much more interesting and exciting with uniformly believable performances and more evocative atmosphere than this new movie.<br /><br />In the Electric Mist is okay to watch when one feels like veging out and theres nothing better on TV. But then so are infomercials.',neg

'It took 9 years to complete this film. I would think that within those 9 years someone would have saidhey this film is terrible. Ive seen better acting in porn movies. The story is tired and played. Abused child turns into serial killer. How about something new for a change. How about abused child turns into a florist? At least that would have been a new twist. Why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea (especially unoriginal movie ideas) thinks that they can be a director? I do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed. That shows tenacity and spirit. With this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script.

Its political irrational and irresistible. Anyone who says they dont like it is lying There is a character for every one. Peter Stewie & Quagmire are my favorites. Peter because he is rude obnoxious and just doesnt give a crap. Stewie because of his amazing intelligence and how he hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it. And quagmire because one of guilty pleasures is dirty jokes. Also there is an episode for everybody too. If youre the political type there is Mr. Griffin goes to Washington (VOL.2 SEASON 3). If you like more of the sexual and bodily humor there is emission impossible (VOL.2 SEASON 3.). Or if you like any other kind of humor there is dammit Janet (VOL.1 SEASON2).Basicly what im saying is that when you watch this show there is side splitting humor for everyone. GIGGITY GIGGITY GOOOOO!',pos
'Lets see where to begin... bad acting; Im not sure if Id even call it that as it more along the lines of a no-effort script read. The actors didnt even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless. Sure there was a scene or two with nudity but that couldnt save this movie from its lifeless characters.<br /><br />To call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do. The lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants.<br /><br />Budget? Did this movie even have a budget? It seemed like they used less money than Ive seen in a home-shot YouTube video. Bad lighting props poor sound post production. Bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that. Story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so but there was no life to this flick; I dont care who directed it.<br /><br />Ive seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom. Dont waste your time or youll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review. Check the ratings youll see the 1s are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10s with hardly anything in between. Wish I would have looked a little closer before wasting my time. What a suck-fest!',neg
'Kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness! The plot is so contrived and unbelievable. . . starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people(including clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. Next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces. A very unpleasant and coo coo mother aided abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving the setting from an island off the coast of South Carolina did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget. The very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger whom I do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade. Also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads. I thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all. The movie I kept surfing back and forth to had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much. Unless you like an unbelievable story wooden acting a contorted mixture of religious/mythological/allegory my advice is to skip this one. Oh and maybe a small carping criticism but wouldnt a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the scenery',neg
'Casting unknown Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a stroke of genius. Shes perfect. Her acting inexperience actually works in her favor. Weve never seen her before so it really feels like her story. She also brings across genuine toughness. This works against her though because we never doubt her. You never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we dont think she can beat. So as a boxing movie it fails.<br /><br />Then again this isnt really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that isnt a boxing movie? You dont. But Karyn Kusama has anyway. Like many indie films Girlfight defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real life.<br /><br />Diana is doing poorly in school. She beats up people she doesnt like (all the other girls in her school for example). She doesnt fit in. Her father is forcing her kid brother Tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing as if she has no need to defend herself nor anything worthwhile to make of her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (cliche yuck) so he gives up his boxing allowance to Diana who actually wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls for another boxer Adrian (Santiago Douglas) whos looking to turn pro. From there the story winds down toward the inevitable...the two meet in the amateur title fight.<br /><br />What left me cold was that I never found any of this all that interesting. Its all just a bit too believable. Kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports. A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing where anger is your friend. So this time its a girl. Big deal.<br /><br />Or theres another position to take: finally a boxing movie about a girl. Womens boxing has been around a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of peoples their lives and their feelings. The whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-discovery.<br /><br />I recommend Girlfight because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director. The dialogue never rises above soap opera quality but the story itself actually changed my view on some things. Yes the world now seems like a better place. A film did that.<br /><br />Grade: B-',pos
'Perry Mason: The Case of the Glass Coffin finds Raymond Burr defending David Copperfield/Rick Blaine like magician Peter Scolari from a murder charge involving one of his assistants. A trick involving a suspended glass coffin in midair goes awry and the body of Nancy Grahn comes a tumbling out.<br /><br />Nancy was one of six female assistants who work with the act and we learn two things about her. First in a moment of drunken weakness Scolari got seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated. Secondly she is living under an assumed name and had a secret from her past.<br /><br />Billy Moses who probably never thought hed be doing such rough stuff back in law school gets to tangle with a couple of good old boys when goes seeking the truth in Grahns home town. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky he almost gets himself killed. <br /><br />One big flaw in this mystery is simple forensics. The medical examiners report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that Scolari could not possibly have done the deed. The police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer. <br /><br />When you see who the killer is you wont blame the individual but youll also see how the investigating officer James McEachin got it wrong from the start. It kind of spoils this particular Mason film.',neg
'This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected. The first two being The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes.<br /><br />I have always had a fascination with UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO investigation that was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes it all went horribly wrong.<br /><br />I could have stood for the acting the camera angles the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing UFOs but none here. I am not saying there was anything wrong with the subject matter but Netflix pushed this movie as a UFO skeptic and a UFO believer investigating multiple sitings.<br /><br />I stopped watching about half way thru. Cant believe I wasted that much time with this one. Please dont make the same mistake I did.',neg
'As a girl Hinako moved away from her small village to Tokyo leaving behind her two best friends Fumiya and Sayori. She returns as a young woman surprised to find that Sayori died when she was a teenager. She reunites with Fumiya and they are horrified to learn that Sayori is mysteriously being resurrected via the island of Shikoku. Oh boy. I rented this because I like Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama a nifty actress. Unfortunately if I had to describe Shikoku in one word it would be fruity. This movie is silly boring poorly filmed unimaginative and most of all unscary. Kuriyama has minimal screen time as the resurrected Sayori and her character is given little to work with.',neg
'Gullivers Travels is at the beginning a satiric novel written by a great misanthropist called Jonathan Swift. So it is not recommended to judge of this movie just by itself. We must go deeper into Mans conscience to get to the point where Swift would have lead us. Gulliver has lived a voyage of truthfulness of solitude of apprehension of what may be his true life. We cannot just sit and watch that movie saying it is so cutie or so boring. The matter is far beyond that and I would like everyone to expect that. This is the greatest movie ever as far as you can feel the truths that emerge from Ted Dansons character: the unforgettable Lemuel Gulliver.',pos
'Like many others have commented before me here I have to say that this movie is bad but not the worst Ive seen. There will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment because I hate spoilers.<br /><br />I got a feeling I was watching an episode of a TV show or something where they had gotten a hold of some extra $$$ to spend on CGI (Ive seen worse of those)... All in all it is quite an insult to the viewer at least if you have ANY knowledge about computers and/or technology at all. There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable and I found myself just begging for it all to end - fast - halfway through. In addition there are countless easy way out scenarios which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being...<br /><br />This movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old Wargames and I think its a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel.<br /><br />Two stars from me because of one thing and one thing only: the actors performances arent half-bad considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with. Still they should never have signed on to this movie. Not really a career-move but I guess we all have bills to pay.<br /><br />To those of you who gave this movie top score...you have to be on the studios payroll or something thats my only explanation.<br /><br />To all who havent seen this one: by all means watch it and make up your own mind. But lower your expectations to the floor (and then some).',neg
'This movie was like a bad train wreck as horrible as it was you still had to continue to watch. My boyfriend and I rented it and wasted two hours of our day. Now dont get me wrong the acting is good. Just the movie as a whole just enraged both of us. There wasnt anything positive or good about this scenario. After this movie I had to go rent something else that was a little lighter. Jennifer Tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress. Her character seems manic and not all there. Darryl Hannah though over played she does a wonderful job playing out the situation she is in. More than once I found myself yelling at the TV telling her to fight back or to get violent. All in all very violent movie...not for the faint of heart.',neg
'Okay like many other such films spawned out of a SNL skit. But Tim Meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a 3 minute one-dimensional character into a moderately viable comedic movie character. He drops amusingly consistently-threated one-liners with fair frequency Billy Dee Williams is in it though his Lando days are long gone and the entire thing is shot pretty well. True its not great art but if you went into Waynes World looking for the Gone With The Wind you did something wrong. Enjoyable for what it is.......',pos
'I kind of liked The Lonely Lady. Give Pia a break. She looks great and she has really nice eyes. Whats not to like? The scene where she gets raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was kind of gross and cruel. Actually a LOT of stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel. But its a trashy movie. A lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad. I liked this better than Valley of the Dolls which was not only trashy but boring as well. At least this wasnt boring.<br /><br />Pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable. Im sure Pias a nice person in real life she just doesnt project the writer vibe. She looked much happier when she was working as a hostess for that guy from Saturday Night Fever and wearing a glittery disco dress.<br /><br />A couple of the scenes are funny. The one where she tells the two-timing actor that shes pregnant and he rolls his eyes and snaps at her to stop hanging around! all the while hes practically fawning over every bimbo who flounces by.<br /><br />Pias nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably a mistake to go so supernova on it (the vortex of floating faces and freeze-frame scream - whoa!) and her subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of overdone.<br /><br />The acceptance speech is a hoot though. I want to see someone do that speech in a drama class.<br /><br />But again this is trash were talking about. You could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties.',pos
