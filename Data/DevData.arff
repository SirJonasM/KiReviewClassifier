'I grew up with the Abbott and Costello movies A. because my dad grew up with them and both our last names are abbott so we owe the deo a bit of respect I didnt realize the flack this movie and others of theres gets. It was a really clasic due it was funny cause abbott and costello were always the same characters but it was sooo funny now what i like about jack and the beanstalk is that even though the love story is totally boring and that one song the prince sings omg  awefull but i like the angle they took on the love story the couple has to get married cause one kingdom is running out of money they meet in the jail cell and fall in love becaue they both pretend not to be royal and they end up being the couple so happy ending i dont think that was the orginal version if it was they should have cut it out of this movie but i think it was orginal and i love it. but watching it sucks lol also when the movie really kicks in with the giant + abbott and costello it is sooooo funny. when the giant is beating jack into the door and jack is screaming OPEN THE DOOR OPEN THE DOOR that stuff is really funny. And that once joke where jack starts screaming prince prince and all those dogs jump him. kinda cheezy but really orginal. i wish they would have al least tried to remaster it though i got that africa screamsjack and the beanstalk and i dont mind the quality cause when i had it on tape it was bad quality also so whatever i guess. the begining is mildly funny the middle is really really funny and the end is not funny in the least but i am 19 years old and when a movie made in 52 makes me laugh this hard it rocks this movie is really funny. i love their style. also the chapters suck. also the part where jack is climbing the beanstalk and they are all singing a song about what a dipstick jack is and that he will be killed thats pretty funny',pos
'I watched an episode. Yes I sat through the entire miserable experience and I have to say this brand of comedy is one of the worst you will get. Imagine Peter Griffin of Family Guy fame. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a(admittedly slim and minus the glasses) woman except that he now lacks the something that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot but he doesnt know hes an idiot. Sarah has none of the genuine character none of the acting ability to pull her character off. Maybe its the trite formulaic jokes that pull her comedy even lower than her character can take it by herself. Maybe its the lack of believable foils. Her insensitive bigoted persona may appeal to insensitive bigoted people unlike the mass appeal that Stephen Colberts insensitive bigoted character has. Like Bill OReilly Sarah creates an annoying unfunny character. She lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire let alone for the entire world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman lacks its noticeable. And when you dont believe it and identify with it its not funny anymore.',neg
'The book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life. But saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement. The acting directing cinematography and storyline were all horrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Ive told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie! I did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly but they have left out too many key components of the book. The movie tried but failed to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only demeaned the central theme of the prophecy. While putting myself in the position who had not read the book I saw the Celestine Prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy B.S. I am thoroughly disappointed with Redfield for the way this movie turned out.',neg
'I cant believe I wasted my time with this movie. I couldnt even call it a movie. It was so bad with nothing to recommend it. <br /><br />I like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death. Badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious. You have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie. I wonder what I was thinking watching it to the end. I recommend this movie to no one. How did they release this? Was there an audience who likes this kind of movie? There must be because you can find this at almost any video store. But why?<br /><br />Deserves to be forgotten.<br /><br />If you like bad movies then this is for you.',neg
'I just viewed MURDER AT THE VANITIES in the newly-released Universal Pre-Code set and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed the vehicle end to end. Most of the other commentators have covered the story a murder mystery within a musical but I wanted to add a few additional notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively bland compared to even most of the minor players and neither one really seems to have the proper voice for what theyre singing (Carlisle being a trained opera singer Brisson a bit wobbly on some of his high and low notes). The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well off each other with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball rolling between musical numbers. Yes Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanities girls but lets not forget the splendid jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the Ebony Rhapsody number. Gail Patrick makes one of her early appearances sounding a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick would go on to become the executive producer of the Perry Mason TV series. Then theres Jessie Ralph as the wardrobe mistress--youll spot her also in David COPPERFIELD (as Aunt Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. The music is very good--Brisson introducing the standard Cocktails for Two in two different scenes; Sweet Marihuana with barely clad peyote button girls in the background (blood dripping on one chorines white skin was wonderfully chilling); the Ebony Rhapsody with Duke Ellingtons Orchestra and a bevy of beautiful dancers both black and white mixing it up. And I believe this is one of the only early musicals to feature such a mix--and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination.',pos
'In the world of shorts (most of which arent) this film is a gem.<br /><br />A quiet concise peek into the world of a young woman whos a reader for a blind woman here the stellar Elizabeth Franz - this film bears the textures layers and visual storytelling of a sumptuously painted still life.<br /><br />The dialogue is minimal the cinematography is stunning and the direction sure clear and compelling. I saw this film in a film festival held in a loud and crowded Tribeca bar - and within the first two minutes (and for the first time that night) the crowd fell quiet.<br /><br />That says it all.',pos
'Paul Bettany did a great role as the tortured father whose favorite little girl dies tragically of disease. For that he deserves all the credit. However the movie was mostly about exactly that keeping the adventures of Darwin as he gathered data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and skipping completely the disputes regarding his ideas.<br /><br />Two things bothered me terribly: the soundtrack with its whiny sound practically shoving sadness down the throat of the viewer and the movie trailer showing some beautiful sceneries the theological musings of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle against blind faith thus misrepresenting the movie completely.<br /><br />To put it bluntly if one were to remove the scenes of the movie trailer from the movie the result would be a non descript family drama about a little child dying and the hardships of her parents as a result. Clearly not what I expected from a movie about Darwin albeit the movie was beautifully interpreted.',pos
'Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a jollies project for Robert Redford as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the Alpine sunshine.<br /><br />The story is as light as powdered snow with Redfords small-town boy David Chappellet (what kind of lead name is that?) who with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory gets up the nose of in no particular order his coach father and team-mates. Women are a mere side-show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of heavens above a free-thinking independent woman played by Camilla Sparv. The ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day. Plus Im not convinced that the Winter Olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel I couldnt really be that excited for him one way or another.<br /><br />Of the actors Redford best profile forward doesnt need to do much and indeed doesnt while Gene Hackman does better with equally meagre material. Ms Sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats Redford the way hes doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way.<br /><br />In truth though theres a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences dont fully compensate and you dont care a fig for any of the leading characters. One of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it.',neg
'Denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie.<br /><br />Maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie. Someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes. That and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before.<br /><br />So first it confuses you and then it puts you off. The dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve.<br /><br />Of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers. Granted it does that so if you are looking for that ... knock yourself out.',neg
'This is one of the films that killed the spaghetti western. It not only loses something in the translation it is a total chaotic mess of editing as well. Either chunks of it have been edited out and or re-edited for an English language version. In any case it makes little or no sense period. It makes the Trinity and the Eastwood Man With No Name films look like John Ford/John Wayne by comparison. Nothing in this film is original. Somewhere in there is a beginning a middle and (finally)an end. Except for the end not everything is exactly in that order. Robert Wood seems personable enough. The rest of the cast especially the women should have made better career choices.',neg
'This film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs. After a tense chase he is saved by said grandpa with magic whip.<br /><br />We are then introduced to a string of annoying house mates including one tart who is always half dressed. During this stage the film heightens tension with strange plinky plinky background noises that had me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I stopped paying attention for a while but when I looked back on the screen there where weird creature type things going around grunting and killing. One word of advice if you are ever trapped in your home by some nutter - get some cardboard boxes and a tray.<br /><br />Although we did skip half the film because it was totally non interesting or memorable we are now at the stunning conclusion the last surviving creature thing fights a Whip Duel with grandpa and his magic whip. I wont say what happens here but I can say the whip battle is full of tension with aerial fights split level fights and all manner of drama.<br /><br />I am now going to shove this film through the door of a neighbour i dont like.',neg
'Its exactly what I expected from it. Relaxing humorous and entertaining. The acting couple was awesome as well as the scene selection. I personally recommend this. Its kind of the movie that can be seen by whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or getting bored. This cute movie will make you smile and laugh too. And the action scenes are tasty. Classics of modern american comedy. And very well done.',pos
'This move was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler because it sucked bad! The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way. (Not bad tits and ass though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The wolf if that is what you can call it is hardly shown fully save his teeth. When it is fully in view you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI because the wolf runs like hes running in a treadmill and the CGI fur looks like its been waxed all shiny :)<br /><br />The movie is full of gore and blood and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed they didnt do a good job at it.<br /><br />Dont even get me started on the actors... Very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds. But then again if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks then hey where do I sign up?<br /><br />Overall boring and laughable horror.',neg
'SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />I dont go into high tech movies expecting them to be 100\% accurate on all things computer related. But somehow even the average I have a computer user is supposed to believe that:<br /><br />1) A computer professional with a top secret special data<br /><br />2) is going to keep the primary copy of said data on a 1.44 floppy<br /><br />3) and make absolutely NO BACKUP of this special secret data<br /><br />Even high school students back up their homework for goodness sake.<br /><br />Also this is the worst represntation of a computer nerd ever. Even though she is super cute we are supposed to believe that she has no friends neighbors extended family or coworkers who can identify her. Even the unabomber had a family that could turn him in.<br /><br />END SPOILER<br /><br />These arent just minor mistakes that had no bearing on the movie - These are the major plot points that fueled the storyline. The characterization was awful the plot wholly unbeleivable and if you havent seen this dont bother.',neg
'I really like Richard Gere...I always have and it seems as of late that his status as a Hollywood star and money maker has slipped but it would appear to me that the reason is that he is taking very mature intense roles and has been very successful at it just not financially because I have seen him in some truly great gems as of late including The Hoax The Hunting Party (both must see films! See my reviews) and now this The Flock which apparently was meant to be a big release considering its substantial 35 million + budget. It seems that some of the other IMDb reviews are very very harsh because I thought the film dealt with a potentially very serious social issue in a very direct violent and disturbing way and Gere just brings it all home. Its an action thriller drama that kept my glued to the Television with its story. I think part of the problem that people seem to have with it is that it Hollywood-izes a very serious issue but I dont think it does it with disrespect but rather tries to take a different spin to make people aware that this exists. In fact its much the same way that The Hunting Party dealt with war. Hong Kong director Wai-keung Lau did a decent job holding it together but I think the cast is what made it watchable.<br /><br />Richard Gere as you may have guessed from my previous comments is brilliant as a social worker of sorts Erroll Babbage who has kind of created his own style and laws when it comes to keeping track of his Flock who are registered violent sex offenders. He holds no punches in tracking these people following them and making absolutely sure they dont re-offend and if they do hell be the one to identify and stop them any way he can. Gere is so intense and looks drained from this job and hes become violent and angry at watching these monsters loose on the street. He is just fantastic. Claire Danes is also terrific as Babbages new partner and his replacement who he has to train to do his job. Danes character is far more typical social worker and is a little taken aback by Babbages style and methods but slowly realizes what he is trying to accomplish and go up against. The two of them are brilliant together and have terrific chemistry with such vastly different characters. KaDee Strickland plays a disturbed registered offender who appears to be torn from the headlines as she plays a character very reminiscent of Karla Homolka (Paul Bernardos wife who is now out) for those of you who follow Canadian serial killers. Her character goes a little over the top but she is convincing and horrifying all at once. Russell Sams has a small role as Stricklands new boyfriend and he would have been better probably given a bigger role. Ray Wise who is a terrific character actor (check him out in Dead End as well as the amazing turn as Satan himself in the WB show Reaper) and he gets a small but good role as the head of the Public Safety department and Babbages boss.<br /><br />The movie isnt perfect despite the terrific performances of its lead cast. It takes liberties by really trying to make the film more entertainment than educational but its just a different angle not unlike the Nicholas Cage dud 8MM. The Flock takes you into the underbelly of the sex trade kidnapping human trafficking and more and is just really something to watch. Perhaps it wasnt directed or written as well as it could have been but I am telling you that Danes and Gere together make this movie completely watchable and a really great thriller. Its disturbing but also something that isnt very complex and yet Geres character in many ways is intensely complex with many layers and also opens social stigma and makes you contemplate about vigilantism in many ways when you see the people Gere deals with. I encourage you all to ignore poor reviews and see it for yourself because its worth checking out!! 8.5/10',pos
'Its great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot. Also loved hearing her sing. Nice change to see her out of her CSI/West Wing/ER roles. The movie itself was entertaining but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts. Several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why. Each character was quirky though and in some cases I couldnt wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This movie wasnt full of squeaky clean people but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them.',pos
'Veteran director and producer Allan Dwan whose huge string of films includes both the utterly forgettable and the recurrently shown (for example John Wayne in Sands of Iwo Jima) tried his hand at a big musical with I Dream of Jeanie. Harnessing a lead cast of singers with little past film experience and as it turned out virtually no future he spun a fictional and in no small part offensive story about the great American songwriter Stephen Foster.<br /><br />Bill Shirley is the young lovestruck Foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for an injured little black boy. His intended is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence) whose pesky younger sister Jeanie (Eileen Christy) is slowly realizing shes in love with the nearly impecunious song-smith. Foster is in love with Inez who is revolted by the composers Number 1 on the Levee Hit Parade Tune O Susannah. Enter minstrel Edwin P.Christy (Ray Middleton) to help launch the profit-making phase of Fosters career.<br /><br />This is by the musical-film standards of the early Fifties a big production. The sets are lavish in that special Hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings. The singers arent half bad and the Foster songs are almost impossible to ruin.<br /><br />But this is also a literal whitewash of the antebellum South. The biggest number features black-face for all on stage an historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unthinking racism. Were these portrayals of blacks anywhere near reality the abolitionists would be rightly condemned for interfering with so beneficent an institution.<br /><br />I Dream of Jeanie apparently sank into the studios vault with barely a death whisper. Now revived by Alpha Video for a mere $4.99 its a period piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentalizing about the victims of Americas great crime slavery.<br /><br />This was what Hollywood was putting out two years before Brown v. Board of Education. Must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who wore their bed linen to the theater.',neg
'Theres an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie - its just a brainless comedy dont take it seriously. Chillax dude!!! Well thats one point of view. The other would be - why are we accepting exactly the same script the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these comedies.<br /><br />What you get is a slacker who through some totally unreal circumstances has to change his life (always a he) overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a raccoon or a teenager beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a slacker but with more money/self-esteem. On the way somebody does something gross but very illogical. This means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like you wont believe it maaann. This guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhoea the other guy left after he ate laxative brownies. Then he shines his shoes with it. Hilarious.<br /><br />Most of the usual names turn up. David Spade and Rob Schneider do unfunny shtick but theyre crrrazzeee characters - a Russian and Im holding my sides a waiter in a vegan restaurant. Adam Sandler the king of the brainless unfunny illogical comedy co-produces and some talentless nobody called Dante shows up yet again. The US will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy Dante is famous for cos we are clueless. Allen Covert plays a 36 year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me. He was 42 and looked years older.<br /><br />Did I laugh? Yes but no more than I would at a TV sit-com and I dont have to pay a penny to watch them. Please stop making these movies.',neg
'This was terrible mean-spirited and full of the worst clichés and racial stereotypes Ive seen in a looong time. Seeing Hayden P trying to act ghetto was painful (hi one pant leg up on yer sweats and some braids Downst make you down with the homies). Solange Knowles pretty much grimaces through the entire movie. Most of the set sequences look like they were filmed in cardboard boxes...what was up with the finale??? And poor Rihanna was just plain exploited to get people to watch her act which she cant.<br /><br />Put simply this film Downst even deserve one star. Please put this tired franchise to rest. Or at least make the next one Bring It On IV: Cheerleaders vs. Freddy & Jason.',neg
'This film which I rented under the title Black Voodoo should be avoided. I was expecting a blaxploitation/horror flick; but what I got was a very dull standard ghost extracts vegence. In this case the ghost was that of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment but whos plea was ignored and he died in an operation. The result: his spirit posesses Nurse Sherry and forces her to commit acts of murder. The only voodoo connection was to one of the three black characters in this case a blinded ex-football player whos mom practiced voodoo. The film is very slow and very dull. There is a very standard ending that provides on excitement followed by a horrificly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER)<br /><br />In which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she was possessed. This movie is slow and bad in a non-funny just stupefying way. Avoid it at all costs.',neg
'This really doesnt match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isnt as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. The scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isnt interesting. <br /><br />The only good thing about this un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging. <br /><br />Zenigata Goemon and Jigen dont even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. Its like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing. <br /><br />The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote.',neg
'This movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few African Americans are aware. My own two children are by products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black skin woman whose parents were ex-slaves. He married outside of and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family except for one sister who took pity on her brothers plight; raising 8 children during the great depression of 1929; providing the family with food whenever she could. Of course she clandestinely aided this family fearing for her own ex-communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We have made it a part of our library.',pos
'Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe and his most recent cinematic work of art is Ponyo a childrens fairytale borrowing on story elements from The Little Mermaid. Of course like other Miyazaki classics such as Spirited Away and his last film Howls Moving Castle Ponyo is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults but this it is distinctly more a childrens story than those recent efforts. Its a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable aiming for charm instead of conflict.<br /><br />Ponyo is the story of a bug-eyed childish-looking fish of the same name the daughter of an undersea sorcerer who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl. When she does she quickly befriends a young boy named Sosuke. In the process she gains a strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea and a giant storm drowns most of the cliff-top town where Sosuke lives with his mother and it threatens to end the world.<br /><br />Like Howls Moving Castle Walt Disney picked up Ponyo for an American release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of Western voices even choosing homegrown products in the youngest siblings of Disney band the Jonas Brothers (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister Noah) to voice Sosuke and Ponyo respectively. Also voicing characters are Liam Neeson (Fujimoto Ponyos father) Tina Fey (Lisa Sosukes mother) Matt Damon (Sosukes father) Cate Blanchett (Ponyos sea goddess mother) and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by Betty White Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to American audiences and Disney is getting close.<br /><br />But voices are of little significance in a Miyazaki film which is all about visual creativity. A fan of transformations and animating liquid and fluid motion creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater mustve been a joy for Miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story. Among the highlights are droplets of water that Fujimoto sends after Ponyo that move like living waves as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make Ponyo as awing as any other Miyazaki film.<br /><br />As a childrens story however Ponyo concentrates its efforts on being adorable. The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is heart-warming even if Noah Cyrus shouting childishly when Ponyo excitedly embraces human life can get a bit annoying. But as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are theres very little antagonism or danger. Past Miyazaki films have clear villains but the conflict in Ponyo actually shrinks as the story goes along. Sosuke believes hes lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of whack and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea but Ponyo is mostly tension free. Most glaringly its climax is uneventful despite how overall likable all the characters are.<br /><br />Ponyo will surely satisfy Miyazakis fans in every way with its imagination and newcomers will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling but this is distinctly more of a childrens movie best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience. Its not quite what youd expect from Miyazaki considering his recent work but its sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories. ~Steven C<br /><br />Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com',pos
'It was on a day in 1891 when Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson surprised his boss Thomas Alva Edison with his remarkable work in the development of motion pictures. After many experiments Dickson was now able to capture scenes of real life with his camera and reproduce them through his invention the Kinetoscope as if a fragment of time were preserved in celluloid. Soon Dicksons Kinetoscope would become an enormous success as a new way of entertainment with many people eager to pay the nickel that was charged to be able to watch people dancing or acrobats performing stunts through the peepshow of the Kinetoscope. However the invention wasnt complete in order for it to capture on film the real life as we know it sound was needed on the movies. So Dickson kept experimenting and this short experiment Kinetophones first film was the result.<br /><br />In this experiment codenamed simply as Dickson Experimental Sound Film director William K.L. Dickson stands in front of a recording cone for a wax cylinder (earliest method of recording sound) with his violin on hands playing a song named Song of the Cabin Boy. The idea was to record the song into the cylinder at the same time that the camera was recording his movements. In order to show that this was a motion picture two of Edisons Black Maria laboratory decided to do a little dance in front of the camera. Unlike what author Vito Russo claimed in his book The Celluloid Closet this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality as it obviously is a reference to the environment of loneliness of the lab akin to the lonely sailors to whom the Song of the Cabin Boy was dedicated to (the title Russo suggests The Gay Brothers is actually anachronistic as gay had no homosexual connotation in the late 1890s).<br /><br />Sadly Dickson was unable to achieve the desired effect and the Kinetophone never could really produce the synchronized audio with images. While he had the cylinder with the sound and the celluloid with the images the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Louis Lumières Cinématographe prompted Edisons team to focus on projecting systems and eventually Dickson left the company. Fortunately in 1998 Dicksons cylinder with the movies sound was rebuilt and film editor Walter Murch made a restoration of the experiment as it was intended. Finally Dickson Experimental Sound Film could be heard with synchronized sound just as its creative inventor had intended. While it was not a successful attempt this outstanding film is a testament of the enormous genius of the father of Kinetoscope. 8/10',pos
'This unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a POW escape during WW II. The performances are incredible especially Anthony Steele.

'Bloody marvelous. Recommended by a friend who knew I liked Thomas Kretschmann in The Pianist and Downfall. I loved the flow of the narrative - how the characters moved from hope and ideals of valour through shock fear disintegration desperation and utter annihilation. A first rate anti-war movie that must have created quite the stir in Germany. Not a proud moment for anyone and the study of a generation lost. This movie was excellent at conveying the remove of the command from the ground troops and in pounding the utter futility of trying to control untamed nature and the Russian psyche. If I didnt know I would have thought it was a Russian movie it was so fatalistic. What an uncompromising ending. A pieta.',pos
'Valeria an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man Massimo and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a yes no or I dont know. The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent. An example would be the distance of both Massimo and Valeria taking a coffee in the same room separated by subtle divisions and not seeing each other. I could mention several sequences however it is better to see the movie. It is impressive to watch that not a single detail is out of control by the director. Although all actions are performed in slow movements no shouts are necessary not special effects but only great acting and a touching well written story. I loved it.',pos
'I took a chance on Hardcastle and McCormick by purchasing the first seasons worth (Canadian release) from Amazon. When I got it I started with the pilot and I was instantly hooked after that. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon and I am rating it 10 stars here. It is just that good. What I liked about it were the opening and closing themes and of course Stephen J. Cannells logo at the end of each episode but most of all the relationship between the Judge and Mark as they worked together to crack each case. I was so hooked that I also purchased the second season as a companion and I enjoyed it equally. If you do not have this excellent series on disc I believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection.',pos

These were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a 10 to 14 foot human somewhat supporting the David and Goliath tale from the bible.

'This film is just plain lovely. Its funny as hell and as old as the hills. The acting is superb and its fascinating seeing post-war Britain and how we used to behave in those days. This seems to have been some pre-runner to the St. Trinians films (given the Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford connection - theres also a very young George Cole in there who appeared in many St. Trinians films) but I dont myself understand the connection. It was shown on BBC4 recently after a biography of St. Trinians creator Ronald Searle however I missed enough of the biography to miss the connection with this film. Anyway a great film in its own right and something that should be preserved for all time!',pos
'Walter Matthau can always improve a mediocre film and this movie proves it. He turns in a very realistic performance as a small-time horse trainer and single father not sugar-coating either role.<br /><br />He can be by turns soft-hearted and doting then iron-handed to his boys and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training (we see that he doesnt want his young prospect racing horse overworked and hurt in small-time races but he seems to be willing to risk the horses life when he gets into the big time).<br /><br />This is just one of Matthaus wonderful performances and one that I highly recommend.',pos
'Boy-girl love affair/sequel with songs only this time shes the punkette and hes the straight arrow. Movie-buffs out there actually like this movie? It has fans? I must say the mind reels... Grease 2 is a truly lame enterprise that doesnt even have the courage moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames (like Jaws 2 or Exorcist II). No it whimpers along in slow-motion and often just plays dead. It looks and feels cheap with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling. This was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and although she doesnt embarrass herself its a role worth forgetting. A misfire on the lowest of levels. NO STARS from ****',neg
'This is just a great fun lovely film. It captures the true essence of the decade and of the people and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors. Though this film may only be in Black and White it definitely doesnt count against it now in modern days. The main basic purpose of the movie is timeless. This movie features great acting beautiful song and dance numbers and great design work and film shots. Follow the Fleet is also comical there are funny moments moments that will make you laugh but other moments where the acting just gets you so involved into the storyline. Its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade how it can affect those today. If you want to see something great check this out.',pos
'honestly.. this show warms my heart i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started im even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Loreleis are super fast talking witty girls that will truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. its an hour long which is a major PLUS because you cant ever get enough Gilmore! even in one hour.. Emily and Richard Gilmore are KICKS (loralies parents Rorys grandparents) theyre youre average rich parents.. Emily president of the DAR and Richard a well known lawyer and Yale alumni st.. Rory is following in the footsteps of her grandparents and this could not make them any happier of course Rorys mother is so very proud of her but her whole life has worked on ultimately defying her parents and Rory going to Yale did not help her on that journey but believe me every episode she does get closer ;)',pos
'I had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci-fi network. It reminded me of the Irwin Allen TV series of the late 60s (Time Tunnel etc). Excellent effects (they beat Star Trek 5 done 20 years later but then that wasnt very hard to accomplish).<br /><br />I found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production. They would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters level but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting (especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro- politics surprisingly similar to todays European Union!)<br /><br />The plot is indeed reminiscent of Twilight Zone in general (as other users have pointed) but in this case its a compliment.<br /><br />Great sets by the way!<br /><br />7/10',pos
'I have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many IMDb users (Some are saying its his worst movie ever. What?? Havent any of you seen Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on. Duh! What the crap were you expecting from a Jet Li movie? Did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story then just loaded it up with action? Of course not! Black Mask is awesome wall-to-wall action throughout nearly its entire running time. Its also deliciously gruesome and we get plenty of severed limbs decapitations and creative ways of watching the bad guys (and quite a few innocent people too!) get slaughtered. Most of Lis other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to Black Mask; there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence bloodshed or action sequences whatsoever! And that made me a happy camper. Again: if you go into a Jet Li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot you are going for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his movies (though beware of the horrendous dubbing).',pos
'First I would like to admit that Chokher Bali was not my cup of tea. This movie was evidently not targeted toward the masses. Its the type that critics would enjoy watching. The hype and publicity were quite misleading.<br /><br />I was expecting something very dramatic like Devdas. Understanding that the story and time-period demand it I found the movie extremely slow-paced.<br /><br />Im a die-hard Aishwarya fan and I regret to say that I thought she was miscast. The role of Chokher Bali required an actress who can portray herself as subversive not innocent and naive. Everyone else gave a good performance. Tagores depiction of the human condition does come across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme.',neg

The jacket art says the 2003 version.<br /><br />I give it one point for a strong female one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg fosters light blue eyes of which there are plenty of shots of.<br /><br />It was fun seeing David MacCullum casually swimming (the pool has a plexiglass viewing window!) while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in Greece. <br /><br />The sets were marginally impressive-that is rich peoples houses in L.A. and Mendanassos (sp?) where the castle was. I found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around. The wind wasnt fierce enough to be believable to me. I kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nasty...etc. and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding. I stumbled over things like why did she light a fire blow out the match then throw the match into the fire?! Dumb stuff like that. It was clunky at best. Oh well. Robert Morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it.',neg
'What a outstanding movie is this i have not words to describe. i dont know how come the rating of the movie is 7.3 it should be 9.3 but anyways no one else can make this movie and the acting by Akshay is just outstanding the second half of the movie makes u cry and the movie has a really good unexpected ending which makes the movie perfect. you should watch this movie once i think twice well its up to u. Anyways i love this movie and its not just sad and funny but it also gives u a really good meanings and what u should be doing so i think this is one of the best movie in the bollywood history. but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya. the only thing i dont like about this movie is the music well the background music is good but the songs are not good enough i think the music would be better if A R Rahman would be the music director but anyways we cant do anything about that so ya.',pos
'At first I wasnt sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so I looked it up on IMDb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so I thought I would give it a try expecting a movie like Elephant.<br /><br />Once I got past the fact that I am supposed to dislike the Alicia character played excellently by Busy Phillips I realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia is so mean to Deanna played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting. They share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses.<br /><br />Ive just got to say how much I loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it. I couldnt even get through Elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the Columbine tragedy. This movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic. Busy Phillips acting is OFF the CHAIN!!! That is a good thing and I would love to see her progress into some more mature roles.',pos
'A good idea badly implemented. While that could summarize 99\% of the SciFi channels movies it really applies here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and I like action movies and I like all of the main actors so this could have been great. However despite some good acting this movie fails due to Bill Platts bad writing and directing.<br /><br />Another review made the good point of needing to know where youre going so you can get there. This movie doesnt. Its put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words second draft are not in Bill Platts vocabulary. There is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing. This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle.<br /><br />This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front. It also had a habit of aborting a fight early probably just because they couldnt afford it. There are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive (seriously what *is* that?).<br /><br />If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby watch this movie because shes OK. She does manage to break out of her Roswell persona a few times and make for a good tough chick (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything hes ever done since playing Q back in ST:TNG so thats nothing new.<br /><br />In all I gave this movie a 4/10 rating.',neg
'This movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes Nicholas Sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as The Notebook but whats sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in McAdams and Gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of Channing Tatum<br /><br />I felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he cant act leaving an awkward and uneven situation Amanda Seyfried given a great performance only to have Tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene cant recover.<br /><br />This story deserved to be cast right but what it got was a pretty boy who cant act. Tatum should stick to what hes good at movies that are more about his physical ability albeit horrible like GI JOE step up and Fighting. The less he talks the better.<br /><br />Try not to think of me as a jaded hater of Channing Tatum I went in to this movie with an open mind because Ive been surprised many a time by the likes of Adam Sandler in Reign over Me. I gave the same chance to Tatum I didnt view him here as the sum of his past roles purely just by his performance in this movie which sadly was a letdown',neg
'Im not sure how related they are but Im almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story that its based on). Very similar plotline and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie so see that one instead.<br /><br />This one moves very slowly but being a late 60s French movie that is to be expected of the style. Told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school. The editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first particularly since the audio from each overlaps (ie hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa). Also the girls are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school. Finally not much character development to even get you attached to the movie.',neg
'I saw Wicked Little Things as part of the 8 Films To Die For Horrorfest and this was the only film that disappointed me. To wit a mom her little girl and her teenage daughter settle down in an abandoned house in the Pennsylvania mountains. Every night however the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run about and slaughter anyone they find.<br /><br />I guess the director was banking on his viewers being repulsed that children would be capable of pickaxe murders and eating human flesh (of which there are lavish close-ups as a nice homage to George Romero) because the film just isnt scary otherwise. Simply put there are far too many establishing shots of the evil kids jogging to their next murder site. If someones gonna get it in the barn there will be a shot of the kids ARRIVING at the barn (oh the suspense) and then moving in for the kill.<br /><br />Come to think of it why do the kids suddenly walk SO SLOWLY when they corner their prey? And not that I have any experience in this but I think a shotgun blast will throw a child A LOT FARTHER than this film implies...? Nor does it help that the mom is one of the worst parents Ive ever seen in any film. The lock on the front door is busted? You have an EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER in the WOODS with BEARS and MOUNTAIN LIONS! FIX IT you MORON!!! Plus Mom and her oldest daughter look waaaay too close together in age- even for a teen pregnancy and theres a pretty unbelievable death which involves sneaking up on somebody trying to push a car out of the mud with their butt.<br /><br />Im giving this a 3 because it tried. As a splatter film its not bad. But for good scares go elsewhere.',neg

'I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it which is a good thing.<br /><br />I had heard of Bruce Haack but didnt know much about him and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance. I wanted to see this Bruce Haack guy!! I felt as though the makers assumed I already knew him as well as these musicians on the screen which I didnt so I felt a bit left in the dark.<br /><br />When Bruce was finally shown in action it was great and gave me a taste of who Bruce Haack was but it was only a taste. We got treated to more musicians and I felt as though I was being told Look - all these cool musicians are into him so he must be cool! I didnt really care much for the musicians commentary on Bruce.<br /><br />I wanted to see Bruce as a person. You know the important stuff - more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life and yes his use of drugs and other issues. I would of liked to know so much more about his Hackula project. I wanted to get inside his mind. Even if they did this via some voice of god commentary and photos it would of been OK.<br /><br />The animations were good but again I felt these were used as filler they didnt really do anything other than allow me to hear his music and see some imagery based on the Dimension 5 records. I did think it was clever and creative but again... I wanted to learn more about Bruce! <br /><br />Maybe Bruce Haack was this elusive in real life?<br /><br />Anyway - in the end I enjoyed this documentary and felt a sort of sadness that such amazing pioneers and geniuses such as Mr. Haack get forgotten as the march of time stamps ever onwards. I am glad that this film is around to educate people about Bruce Haack even with its flaws.',pos
'I knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny so I went into it with that expectation. I just found it to be so bad it was murderously boring. The whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality. Seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds. There is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise. It could sustain a 3-4 minute comedy sketch maybe but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination.',neg
'If you like plot turns this is your movie. It is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next. Nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will. The characters are all gritty and engaging. Cage is at his best. Dennis Hopper again shows his delightfully sinister side. JT Walsh is perfect in his last performance. Laura Boyle sizzles. Dwight Yoakum makes a film debut superbly in a cameo. I categorize this movie as I am having a really really really bad day film. Not a slow minute in this film. A real sleeper. This movie is underrated and sadly overlooked.',pos
'Predator Island starts as six friends Eric (Tom Dahl) Chris (Dan Gordon) along with Heather (Iris McQuillan-Grace) Kim (Iana Baker) & Denise (Melissa Roby) get invited to spend sometime on Kevins (Michael Wrann) fathers boat partying in the open sea. What could go wrong with such a super sounding idea? Well for starters a big green meteorite could crash into the sea near your boat & an alien life-force could emerge from it & try to kill all of you then again thats just a ridiculously stupid idea isnt it?<br /><br />Co-edited written & directed by Steven Castle I thought Predator Island was crap & its a simple & straight forward as that really. The script is of the worst kind you know the sort of abomination thats full of highly annoying teenage characters who do & say the most stupid things its full of clichés & is utterly predictable it makes next-to-no sense things just suddenly happen without any build up or explanation its boring even at only 70 odd minutes & it has virtually no entertainment value whatsoever not even unintentional laugh value. The film doesnt really have much of what I would call a plot theres no explanation given as to why or how this alien creature can take over peoples minds or why it can be selective in the sense that one moment the person will be normal the next when the story calls for it & with no apparent cause they suddenly get green glowing eyes & a sudden urge to turn cannibal. Theres not enough horror in it the so-called action scenes are pitiful & I really dont want to waste another second thinking about Predator Island let alone wasting my precious energy typing these words...<br /><br />Director Castle doesnt do anything to make this thing watchable & the special effects are absolutely terrible this alien creature dude wouldnt even get into a 50s sci-fi film. The filmmakers even play some blooper footage over the end credits but this has to be the least funny collection of mistakes ever I mean they cant even get it wrong right if you know what I mean! Forget about any decent gore as there isnt any theres a bit of cannibalism & some intestines placed on the unfortunate actors stomach so another unfortunate actor can pick them up & pretend to eat them.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $150000 I have to concede that the filmmakers were working on a seriously low budget thats still no excuse for making such a poor film. The whole thing looks very cheap & the acting is pretty bad.<br /><br />Predator Island is crap Im sorry but thats the way it is & I just fail to see what anyone would get out of it. In my humble opinion this probably one to avoid.',neg
'I picked up TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We have considered taking a trip out east and thought it would give us a feel of what it was like. The film was a total waste of time if I went out to buy it I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw that it costs $49.<br /><br />The DVD ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across Canada with my stomach feeling ill as they went up and down and around curve with the film at high speed.<br /><br />There was a lot of footage they probably shot on this and you would think that they could have made a better product. If I would of done this project I would of provided more footage paused on road signs to let people know where they were and linger in places to view the scenery. To make a film like this it should of been 60 to 90min. Oh yes the case said it was in stereo the whole film was a hissing sound from sped up car sound thet could of at least put some music to it.<br /><br />If you want a good cross Canada film watch The railrodder / National Film Board of Canada starring Buster keaton (the one of the last film he made) in this comical film Buster Keaton gets on to a railway trackspeeder in Nova Scotia and travels to British Columbia',neg
'I think that FARSCAPE is the best scifi since Babylon 5 and is one of the best sci-fi television series of all time (ranking up there with Dr. Who Blakes 7 Red Dwarf MST3K and the aforementioned B5). I find the characters and races of Farscape are much more interesting and imaginative than the typical humans-with-birthmarks that are found in many series. The effects are quite good and the stories engaging. Despite missing the bulk of season 2 and some of season 1 I find the character development very well done.',pos
'Well made documentary focusing on two Sudanese refugees who get resettled in the United States. Its your basic fish out of water story with a non-fiction twist. I found it fascinating to see how Peter and Santino lived prior to coming to America and how they adapted once they arrived here (in Houston Texas.) They expected a sort of heaven but found out that its a lot harder than it looks to cope well in the states. They go from hopeful idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics. Everywhere they go they meet bureaucrats with paper trails that most citizens may take for granted. They fret that they are blacker than the African-Americans here and dont feel accepted because of that. One of the Lost Boys manages to leave Houston to go to Olathe Kansas where he finds conditions slightly better but still less than ideal. There are people that try to help them as well as try to hurt them in this film. Not shown but talked about are those who put a gun to their heads and robbed them leading one Lost Boy to comment negatively that all black people in America are no good. I found it interesting too that they arrived in Houston in August 2001 a month before the World Trade Center was attacked by terrorists. I had hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy but its not mentioned at all. Still all in all a really well done documentary with no narration. None is needed really. The Lost Boys do a fine job expounding on the events going on around them without any help at all thank you very much.',pos

'This foolish implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard-boiled police detective delivers some nearly-audible lines confirming our greatest fears: He is dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of A. Martinez in favor of this sadly-anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. That a no-name hack-tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is brief; his promise is immense. Perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this ill-advised film.',neg

'I saw this movie twice through a pentecostal church my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was of the tender age of 6 my brother 4 then again when I was 8 my brother 6. This movie terrified my brother and I and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust. It wasnt just the movie but it was also the philosophy that engulfs so many christians about the mark of the beastand the rapture. This movie the church and a volatile neglectful upbringing lead to severe paranoia towards the future. For years I lived under the delusional affects of the church and fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. Went through years of counseling. I once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family. I was pegged with a delusional disorder. I actually began to believe this it was my brother who reminded me that this cultic philosophy actually happened. I no longer fear the future I have come to terms with the fear injected into its members by the church.

'I had no expectations (never saw previews for Marigold) and enjoyed the characters contemporary music and sharp dancing in this light-hearted movie. Even though 98\% of the dialog is English (great thing for me) I wish the DVD had subtitles to help with some of the quick moments when the characters accent can be difficult to understand. I wouldnt judge this movie against Bollywood films but just on its own merits as fun entertainment (a musical people movie).<br /><br />Im hooked on Ali Larter as an actress (and her interviews in the Bonus Material indicate she is a nice person).

He was so charming so charismatic; I honestly just wanted to hug him. I feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly. It was so straight did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. He will definitely be missed!!!',pos
'Just watched on UbuWeb this early experimental short film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes you read that right Orson Welles! Years before he gained fame for radios The War of the Worlds and his feature debut Citizen Kane Welles was a 19-year-old just finding his muse. Besides Vance and Welles another player here was one Virginia Nicholson who would become Orsons first wife. She plays a woman who keeps sitting on something that rocks back and forth courtesy of an African-American servant (Paul Edgerton in blackface). During this time a man (Welles) keeps passing her by (courtesy of the scene constantly repeating). I wont reveal any more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jump-cut constantly. Thats not to say this was any good but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score (by Larry Morotta) added in the 2005 print I watched. Worth a look for Welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avant-garde.',neg
'If youve seen Atlantis 1 then youd know that what made that film truly great was brilliant animation and a good script. This movie was SO sloppily drawn and animated. The story is also dopey. I was so disappointed in this half-baked drivel that I couldnt make it past the first hour and MAN did I try! The one thing this film had was that it expanded the mole character making him both more sympathetic and three dimensional. Take it from me judge this junk from the cover on the video box. The cover is poorly drawn Disney schlock clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent. If this was a stand alone flick it wouldnt be so bad but riding on the coattails of a brilliant piece like Atlantis makes it utterly inexcuseable.',neg
'With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie you figure this one wont go wrong. But what can I say? This was a horrible misfire. The movie is about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is incredibly disjointed and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it.<br /><br />That song about arabella Cinderella is pretty cool but that is it. I only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie this is almost the definition of one. I guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times in terms of its definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing not to mention the direction is just so out there. <br /><br />Peter Sellers in particular is very hit and miss he will go from Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career to dumb movies like this and the Magic Christian which was very similar to this one in context and style but that movie did have a few funny moments. This one is senseless and I am sad that someone as great as Peter Sellers was in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.',neg

'Seeing Moonstruck after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared. Who knew that Cher could act? Who had ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents nor was Norman Jewison the director.<br /><br />The only really flat note in this splendid work is When the Moon Hits Your Eye Like a Big Pizza Pie Thats Amore a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is already too many) and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music. <br /><br />Cher is -- forgive me -- sensational as Loretta Castorini a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliges by proposing offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring then rushes off to Sicily to be with his dying mother. He charges Loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother Ronny attends the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile her father (Vincent Gardenia) is cheating on her mother (Olympia Dukakis) which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera.<br /><br />Everything works out in the end as it inevitably does in films of this genre. In the meantime all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself. In its way Moonstruck is how Hollywood used to be at its best: rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever. If theyd only lost Thats Amore along the way it would have been perfect.',pos
'This documentary is incredibly thought-provoking bringing you in to the lives of two long-time lovers who are in the final stages of AIDS. The past footage of their twenty-some-odd years together really brings their final moments home.<br /><br />If this movie doesnt make you feel the pain and agony of these two fascinating people you dont have a heart.',pos
'This a lovely and charming epic fantasy with lots of heart. I got lost in this sweet film watching it at the Manns Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Its truly romantic with a touching message.The artwork and the effects are visually striking and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so apparent. The frames are like watching moving art. It also has a strong and talented cast of actors. What a wonderful surprise to see Joss Ackland he is just a fairy-tale perfect King. Sarah Douglas is terrific as the villain and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz make a lovely romantic pair. The fact that the movie was made on a ridiculously tiny indie film budget just blows me away. It may not be the slick Hollywood stuff were inundated by but its a really nice movie to rent and enjoy curled up on your sofa on a rainy Saturday. Dont forget the microwave popcorn. Thats my advice. Just enjoy it.',pos
'Not funny - how can anyone link this to Monty Python? That is absolutely ridiculous - there are no laughs. This is not funny. Over the top but ugly weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time. Unfortunately something that did not make them funny.<br /><br />It should be given some points for effort etc. whatever. Actually it appears there is a laugh track - or is there one? Hummm.... Since there are barely any laughs thats a debatable question.<br /><br />Maybe Im doing it injustice - maybe its some sort of exercise. Some sort of art - in that case anything goes never mind.<br /><br />But these guys playing women with high-pitched voices turned-up noses. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /><br />There is only one heir apparent to Monty Pythons intellectual wit and that is Stephen Colbert and maybe Jon Stewart.',neg
'I watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend. I got my judgment teeth pulled out so I didnt feel very good.<br /><br />I ended up liking it big time. Its a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship unwanted betrayal power money drug traffic and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail.<br /><br />The acting is on its prime level. Two of the women that I lust the most star and thats a good thing. Claire Danes is as cute and charming as always while Kate Beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance. Bill Pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities.<br /><br />There are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience. Plus it shows the difficult times at Thailand.<br /><br />This is an underrated movie. Not many films like this one have come up in recent history. It should make you reflex about many things...',pos
'Whats this? A Canadian produced zombie flick that I have never heard of before. A mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man. This allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there. Basically he and friends went to a cemetery on Friday the 13th and raised the dead thanks to his silly chanting. Cut back to the morgue where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortician and owner (who gets his eyes popped out). The final WTF? shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screaming Im not crazy! Amazingly he has his eyeballs back.<br /><br />Running a scant 58 minutes this is certainly one oddity in zombie cinema. It feels a lot longer but put me in some kind of trance where I couldnt stop watching. The film also has one of those if you see this image turn away from the screen gags. It is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater (prophetic?) and when he pops up (only twice) the blood begins to flow. The scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period. There is a great gaffe where a zombie chops off a girls right hand with a shovel but - when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp on - it is a left hand.',neg
'Feels like an impressionistic film; if there is such a thing.<br /><br />The story is well told very poetic. the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters (or interpreted by the actors :)).<br /><br />The film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well unless you hate such emotion in movies - not so in my case.<br /><br />Its a very humanistic film.<br /><br />The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right.<br /><br />Well done.<br /><br />A good classic for any good film collection.',pos
'I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable. Judge for yourself. Be warned the following will not only give away the plot but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie.<br /><br />A computer virus designed by a frustrated nerd sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the electrical system of your body. What it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium. Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck develops tunnel vision his skin will turn white of the calcium after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk. <br /><br />This virus is very intelligent. When it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the experts head. The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pcs in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water.<br /><br />Oh dear...',neg
'Children love dinosaurs. Its somewhat part of their culture. But theyve got The Land Before Time. The original. At least that movie had heart. This. This movie is just plain pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs doesnt mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children. This movie has no plot the whole premise is stupid and its more by the numbers stuff. Not as soul sucking as Theodore Rex but its lightyears away from being a Land Before Time.',neg
'I like movies that show real people Americans and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that its USA/Canda but the box states All Regions. I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it. Sorry Bush lovers but this movie is driving you crazy because it makes sense. Get angry and hate it. Disagree with everything in it but I for one stand by it. Its not for the empty minds. It is long and too hard to keep up with but by the second viewing it makes more sense.

'That song keeps humming in my head. Not the greatest song but its the 80s. This movie is about a lead singer who supposebly gets killed while being accused of murders as he stalks his girlfriend who sings backup vocals in his band. The lead singer whos name is Billy Eye (yeah right) is dead after two years and his band comes back for a concert only the backup vocalist is the lead singer this time. Billy stalks her and eventually goes around killing all these people and terrifying the girl and makeing people around her think theres something wrong with her and that shes imagining things. She finally decides to go to a cemetary and dig up his grave to see if hes still there. She sees that hes dead but still sees and hears his voice. During the end of the movie we find out the reason behind all of this Billy has a brother named John (right again) and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those people to get back at him and place the blame on his brother and then take his girlfriend and terrorize her because she called him crazy. The ending is very cheezy and the acting is very lame and wooden. But.... I like it anyway. I watch it for the song. I wish I had it.',neg
'I got about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. It was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic. I can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movies but not when its supposed to be a crime drama thing. The evidence collection and interview processes were just plain oddball. I started fast forwarding to see how it ended. And then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it. The main character played by Ellen Barkin just wasnt believable at all. Peta Wilson acted very well in this film but her character was way out there and there wasnt anyone for her acting talents to play off of that made it work.',neg
'Sydney Lumet hasnt had a box office hit in 20 years and yet at 83 has managed to churn out a tight well-cast suspenseful thriller set in his old stamping ground New York City. (How he got insurance let alone the budget after all those flops is a mystery also). The story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene.<br /><br />Two brothers with pressing financial problems conspire to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents. The only victim is going to be the insurance company. The robbery goes awry and two people die. Most of the film is concerned with the aftermath. The action is non-linear and seen from the main characters differing points of view but it is not difficult to follow. What is not so easy to work out is the back story  how did the brothers get into such a mess? There are clues  the younger brother being the baby of the family is his fathers favorite while the older brother seems to be carrying a lot of baggage about his relationship with his father and vice versa but that hardly accounts for him becoming a heroin-using murdering embezzler.<br /><br />As the scheming older brother a corpulent Philip Seymour Hoffman dominates the film but he is well supported by Ethan Hawke as his bullied inadequate younger brother. Albert Finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that. Marisa Tomei as the older brothers cheating wife at the age of 42 puts in the sexiest performance Ive seen in many a year. The film literally starts with a bang but we are out of that comfort zone pretty quickly.<br /><br />I dont know the origins of this story by first time scriptwriter Kelly Masterton but I suspect that like Lumets great 70s film Dog Day Afternoon it is based on fact  its too silly to be untrue. Lumet is just about the last of those immensely versatile old-time craftsman studio directors who with immense speed were able to direct just about anything that was put in front of them. Some great films were produced that way as well as some classic turkeys. This isnt a classic of either sort  its a well-crafted piece of downbeat entertainment. It will probably leave you feeling that you were lucky not be a member of a family as dysfunctional as this one but still wondering as to how they got that way. We do know the parents were happy but we see so little of the mother and hear so little about her it is impossible pick up on her relationship with the boys. (There is also a daughter whose presence seems redundant). Well like Tolstoy we have to conclude that each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.',pos
'Jim Henson always seemed to put out wonderful television shows. This was sadly one of the shortest lived. It was endearing to hear each tale with their delightful morals. Each episode was a new story with new characters. John Hurt did a wonderful job playing the Storyteller and the sarcastic tone of Brian Henson as the dog was always enjoyable.<br /><br />The set designs and costumes were very well done. The Muppet work when required is classic Jim Henson work. You know it is a Muppet but its endearing appearance more than forgives. You find yourself enchanted and compelled. When each episode comes to an end you realize that you were quite entertained. An entertained that is fulfilling not the kind that wears off after a few moments. You sit back and think about each episode realizing that each story is indeed timeless and presents a strong tale of morality.<br /><br />I have yet to show this to my own children but this is indeed a series that is more than family entertainment. I implore you to find it on DVD and snatch it up. If you cant do that then just find it some how.',pos
'Id have given this film a few stars simply because it was a Lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here New York City. Most on this channel whether set there in rural Iowa Oregon Virginia L.A. etc. are filmed in Vancouver Ottawa Toronto or some other Canadian locale.<br /><br />But if there ever were one deserving the top rating - 10* on this site its this movie. Certainly not for originality for this story has been done many times in many variations with several very similar to this specific one. Its also been done pretty often on the big screen with mega-stars past and present from Cary Grant James Garner Harrison Ford Tom Hanks et al - and Deborah Kerr Doris Day Meg Ryan and many more. I can think of at least 10-12 more just as prominent past to present off the top of my head who could be added now and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind.<br /><br />Not to drone on but my point is that in my opinion this is by far one of the best of this genre Ive seen. I caught it by chance on a mid-day Friday at a time when I had the TV on only because I was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week. Id never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made. And while the two leads have done enough to be known to most they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman (Annas mother) whom Id seen in some things from her younger days and Michael Rispoli (Henry Charlies best friend) who was outstanding as Gramma the menacing juice loan tough street guy from Rounders. <br /><br />The chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends as a sub-story romance with the correlation of their being such to Anna and Charlie being only revealed to all later is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre but makes no difference to the enjoyment here (in fact it enhances it).<br /><br />Checking some other comments I agree completely with those which are the most positive. The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING in caps. This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters in whatever combination presented and all of the supporting and even minor roles.<br /><br />I love films with a harder edge: Rounders; the escapist Schwarzenegger/Stallone fare; Goodfellows; even the classics like Casablanca Gone With the Wind Citizen Kane. But for pure uncomplicated enjoyment this one was outstanding. With a bare fraction of their budgets it was equal to the results achieved by Youve Got Mail and Sleepless in Seattle. And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan couldnt have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films as well.',pos
'This film is so wonderful it captures the gaming life. I laughed so hard while watching this. The movie is about a gaming group that have a hard time with a campaign that their dungeon master came up with. The movie switches from the real world and the gaming world as they play the campaign it shows them in the gaming world as their character and then switches back to the real world when they are not playing. The campaign is the basis for a module that the dungeon master Lodge is writing. The problem is Lodge cant finish his module because the characters cant finish the campaign. They are more for killing and looting instead of role playing. Lodge wants them to role play through the campaign something they have never done before. They decide to bring in some extra help so they bring await for it girl in to play. Lodge also makes a npc a non player character a paladinwho can not witness or do wrong to play. The film is how they do all this and more I dont want to spoil any of the film so I wont say any more. This movie may not be a big budget film the acting may not be Oscar worthy but if you are into gaming or into dungeons and dragons then definitely watch it. They had a lot of fun making this film and it shows I am not going to bash on it for any movie problems such as continuity or any thing it was a low budget film that is just fun. There is some slap stick comedy which I enjoy and some damn good writing in my opinion. So if you want a fun film try it .',pos

'When many people say its the worst movie Ive ever seen they tend to say that about virtually any movie they didnt like. However of the nearly 700 movies I can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that I walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry. This is my first movie review by the way and I registered with IMDb just to rave at this movies badness. I went to see it when it was in the theaters (myself and my two buddies were 3 of 5 people there) and after 15 years I cant remember very many specifics but my attitude upon leaving the theater is still crystal clear.<br /><br />---Spoiler alert---<br /><br />Oh my where to begin. Fat loser left at altar goes on ski weekend meets blonde bombshell who takes an interest in him takes him home to meet the family theyre all cannibals and hes the main course pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape kicks all their butts and runs off with the brothers girlfriend they live happily ever after. Puke. Firstly the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be FUNNY and that this was a COMEDY. The special effects what few there are look like they were done 15 years earlier. The big dramatic ending was so hokey and poorly acted that it was nearly unbearable to watch (he knocks out the entire cannibal family with rakes laying in the lawn that stand up Tom and Jerry style when they step on them). Im sure that theres much much more but I have no intention on seeing it again for a refresher.',neg
'An apt description by Spock of an all-powerful fop into whose clutches fall the crew of the Enterprise. This was one sector of space our starship should have avoided: first Sulu & Kirk simply disappear off the bridge; a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter Trelane a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in attire from an Earth of many centuries past. But he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesnt register on McCoys medical tricorder. The officers manage to escape back to the ship but like some bad cosmic penny Trelane keeps popping up. He brings them all back including some female companionship to continue his games. The dilemma now takes on elements of The Most Dangerous Game out in space and theres an exasperating even infuriating aspect to the crews utter helplessness before such unbridled power.<br /><br />What really makes this a great episode is the memorable performance by guest star Campbell as the overpowering but not all-knowing alien. His character is obviously an early version of Q who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the TNG series. Trelanes confrontation scene with Spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds. As usual Kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis despite being quite outmatched. The answers to exactly what or who Trelane is are right in front of us the whole time so when we do learn the truth it makes complete sense in view of Campbells pitch-perfect acting. He indulges himself constantly preening before some unknown audience remarking on things with a flair which is infectious but not quite right - we cant quite pin it down at first but theres something missing here. Every few minutes his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger. In a way you cant take your eyes off him always waiting to see what he does next. Actor John de Lancie captured that similar tone as Q on the Next Generation series.',pos
'I just watched Lonesome Dove Return To Lonesome Dove Streets Of Laredo and Dead Mans Walk. All excellent. This sorry hunk of junk is cheaply done and poorly acted.<br /><br />In the previous series Captain Call and Gus McCrae come off as tough respectable cowboys. Despite the fact that Caption Call is played by a different actor every time each one quickly won me over. In Dead Mans Walk the boys are believable as the younger versions of the experienced Texas rangers. In Comanche Moon they are just a couple of chubby rednecks. I had to stop watching.<br /><br />I suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinking pile. Its a sorry end to an otherwise great franchise.',neg
'Webs starts in Chicago: Present Day as four electricians Dean (Richard Grieco) Ray (Richard Yearwood) Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) & Junior (Jason Jones) are about to disconnect the electric to an unused building scheduled for demolition. As they search for the relevant cables & stuff they come across a set of doors that according to the buildings blue-prints shouldnt be there being nosey & all that they force the doors open to have a look & find a room full of computers & scientific machinery. As they mess around with some buttons a portal to a parallel universe opens Dean & Junior accidentally fall in with Ray & Sheldon following soon after in search of their friends. Unfortunately theyve all ended up in an exact parallel Earth that has been taken over by a mutant spider thing that either eats people or turns them into mutant soldiers with which she uses to protect herself & do whatever she wants them to really. In a desperate bid for survival they team up with a few of the last remaining humans including the original inventor of the portal Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox) who says that with the help of our electrician boys he might (yeah might) be able to build another portal to take them back home...<br /><br />Edited & directed by David Wu I thought Webs was pretty crap its as simple & straight forward as that really. The script by Grenville Case & Robinson Young is preposterous to say the least & has plot holes in it you could drive a tank through for instance is this film really trying to suggest that a few mutant spider things no bigger than a couple of people in size took over an entire world? How did they do this? If this parallel Earth was the same as ours where the hell was the army? The police? All of our weapons? A few fragile looking spider things against literally billions of humans?! The whole flawed stupid & downright naff concept constantly bugged me throughout the entire film. Lets not forget that there is a inter-dimensional portal to a parallel Earth in the basement of most buildings that have sat there undisturbed for decades & remain in perfect working order right? Then theres the nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase the fact one electrician can make it work perfectly purely by accident as he randomly presses a few buttons in a room that probably had 100s spread over dozens of pieces of equipment & what about the wonderfully thoughtful guy who sets an explosive bobby trap in his base without telling anyone what if one of his mates had set it off & found themselves blown to pieces by their mates homemade bomb? You wouldnt be best pleased would you? What about food? Do they grow their own in little vegetable patches? I could go on & on all day long about how flawed ill conceived & poorly written Webs is but I cant be bothered. The characters are clichéd & annoying as is the film as a whole which obviously doesnt help. The only half decent thing I can say about Webs is that its short & it moves along at a fair pace but when all said & done its still crap.<br /><br />Director Wu has to take a large chunck of the blame here for a start the film looks cheap & the editing that he is credited with is terrible. Theres lots of annoying inappropriate slow motion shots that come from nowhere the action scenes are almost identical & become incredibly boring very quickly. He uses that highly annoying quick cut technique along with a bit of the old jerky camera movement now I dont know about anyone else but I hate this editing style as it just looks a complete incoherent mess. In fact I dont know a single person who does like this sort of thing & Im puzzled as to why filmmakers think people do. Forget about any gore just a few shotgun wounds to the spider zombie soldier guys & they dont have red blood anyway so it doesnt relate to reality in my mind.<br /><br />Webs was made-for-TV the American Sci-Fi Channel I think & it looks every bit as cheap low budget & rushed as you would expect. Its all so bland forgettable flat & dull. The special effects are far from special & the spider thing lacks imagination when finally revealed. The acting was OK considering everything else was so poor & I still cant believe the sweater Grieco was wearing in this.<br /><br />Webs is crap I cant really say anything good about it other than Ive sat through worse films & thats the sole reason Im not giving it 1 star & a quick glance at the IMDb user ratings for Webs confirms what I already knew in that it has more 1 votes than any other & there is very good reason why...',neg
'In a way you have to respect Arachnia. Its clearly meant as a tribute to the big bug movies of the fifties and while the special effects look terrible; at least the film doesnt feature CGI. However on the other hand; you cant respect the film too much because its a load of rubbish. The acting is terrible the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously and once youve seen one giant spider being blown up; youve seen them all so it gets boring rather quickly. The plot follows a bunch of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; which just happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used to use as a circus attraction. Coincidently around the same time the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to rise from underground. All the characters in this film are poor caricatures; none of them have anything even resembling a third dimension and they will soon begin to thoroughly bore you. Youve got to feel for director Brett Piper as he clearly didnt have much to work with for this film; but that doesnt make Arachnia worth a damn and overall there are better giant bug films than this and therefore Arachnia doesnt get the seal of approval from me.',neg
'Lucio Fulci a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in Touch of Death a made for TV movie about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey) a psycho who seduces and murders rich widows in order to pay his gambling debts.<br /><br />Starting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal lothario disposes of his latest victim via chainsaw mincing machine and hungry hogs Touch of Death starts promisingly enough but Fulci soon loses control of proceedings introducing a weird sub-plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed comedic scenes. There are several more graphic murders which in true Fulci fashion are extremely violent and gruesome but even the high level of bloodletting doesnt stop this from being one of Fulcis poorer efforts.<br /><br />As I have found with many of his other movies a comprehensible storyline is not exactly high on the agenda when Lucio is behind the camera. This film has many peculiarities which left me more than little perplexed: why didnt Lester dispose all of his victims using the dismemberment method seen at the beginning? Why are all of his victims either hairy or disfigured? What the hell is that ending all about?<br /><br />Fulci is considered by many to be one of the greats of horror cinema; I dont understand his popularity finding the majority of the films of his that I have seen so far to be generally lacking both decent narratives and technical proficiency. Touch of Death certainly does nothing to change my opinion.',neg
'My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla. The special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie. The whole movie I was waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the storyline was really boring. And when the spiders came they had a very amateuristic look like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60s. I didnt watch the whole movie. When it was played for about one hour I switched off my DVD-player. I watch 3 movies almost every night and I have never walked away from a movie even if it was that boring. The only thing good in this movie was the pretty sheriff :) Thats why I voted 2 instead of 1 :) So dont go see this one instead you should go out and rent Starship Troopers its like the same only 10.000 times better.',neg
'The 1994 film production of Heart of Darkness was in no way capable of living up to the outstanding book. The film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer rather than aiding them in understanding what was going on. The director was obviously not experienced and if he is then he didnt show it. On top of that scenes from the book were left out or changed scenes that were rather important. The movie left me feeling rather bored and was a complete waste of my time. The characters acted as though they had no idea what was going on and the actors did not portray the emotions that Marlow and the rest revealed in the book. Overall the movie was terrible and completely lacked the suspense that was otherwise necessary to make it even remotely interesting.',neg
'i have seen this movie about 50 times already and it doesnt look like i am ever going to get bored of it. i always watch it with my best friend and it has become sort of a tradition for us now to watch it almost every month. every single time we see this movie we both get really emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the TV together and sing all the songs in a loud voice and in the end we always dance.by now we practically know even the whole dialog by heart and watching the film feels like seeing our own old friends on TV.<br /><br />this film is perfect! even though i have to admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy but the characters the dance the music and even the place where it all takes place make you forget all about it and you start believing that things like that really do happen and that the song all you need is love actually has some kind of a meaning.<br /><br />i am really a normal person and not too serious about this comment of mine but i just cant wait until the next time well be able to see Dirty Dancing.',pos
'well i may be bias as i grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a DVD copy as a birthday pressie for my Dad. The film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages.... much better than anything Disney ever made in my opinion (and i used to work in the Disney Store!!!). The characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of Swat the fly. and Smack the mosquito) and the amazing night club scene. The musical numbers still have me humming 20 years after i first watched it. there is no other film that i can better recommend whilst baby-sitting and in fact every child i know (thanks to my Hoppity loving parents) have seen this film many times. It will always get top marks for its fabulous love story a brilliant baddy and over all originality.',pos
'If you want an undemanding and reasonably amusing hour or so then its OK to watch this. Its not all that bad really. Yeah its got more lapses in logic than I care to describe here and might tax the patience of people - like myself I have to admit - who are inclined to throw things at the TV on occasion but its funny at least. Just because its not always INTENTIONALLY funny theres no need to let that get you down.<br /><br />However if youve read the book - or any of the other books by Brookmyre - then youd probably best avoid it. Ive read them all and when I first watched this film I despised it. Ive trashed it in detail and at great length on another site in fact. The TV plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many faithful (and admittedly rabid) Brookmyre fans.<br /><br />Best bit of advice..?

First Cole Wilkison (Brian Keith) comes back from Texas to help his brother run Anchor Then a tough kid with a fancy gun (Richard Jaeckel) shows up on the Wilkison payroll Then all the small ranchers are forced out getting the same kind of offers Parrish saw himself either running like they did or stand and fight<br /><br />But can he easily deals with a man who sends six killers to shoot an old man in the back? Can he easily argues with a man who started with a few acres of land and now owns practically the whole valley? <br /><br />All that grass and sand ever meant to the ex-Confederate Army officer the past three years It was a place to regain his health Out of habit of taking advice Parrish affirms: What happen in this valley is no concern of mine. And much to the disappointment of the remaining ranchers and farmers who pressure him to stay on he decides to accept Wilkisons offer to fulfill the promise he made to his fiancée<br /><br />When Lees younger brother Cole made the wrong move trying to push Parrish make up his mind by lynching one of his ranch hands Parrish got mad and warns the two brothers that he is going to stay and will fight them for the privilege of being let alone <br /><br />Brian Keith plays the traitorous brother whos behind the killing... He dreams to have position and respect in running one day Anchor <br /><br />Lees ambitious wife Martha (Barbara Stanwyck) secretly hates herself and her husband Stanwyck plays the part of a loving wife who cant bear the touch of her husbands hands <br /><br />Edward G. Robinson is good enough as the Anchors crippled owner who promised the whole valley to his wife unaware that she is having an affair with his younger brother<br /><br />Dianne Foster is too sensitive as the unsociable adult daughter well aware of her mothers burdens <br /><br />The Violent Men uses the wide-screen technology to emphasize the scope and power of this harrowing action-drama making it a perfect example of the genres most enduring classics',pos
'I would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered.<br /><br />Why I didnt walk out in the first five minutes of this movie I cannot say. I should have gone with my instinct and left immediately!! Several people in our theater did and sadly I didnt follow them out.<br /><br />The story lacked all criteria for a movie. NO plot. Awful acting! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I may never see another film he is in. Not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk. I did like the tazer scene. Too bad it didnt shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot. Someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film!',neg
'The plot of The Thinner is decidedly thin. And gross. An obese lawyer drives over the Gypsy woman and the Gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight... to the bone. OK Gypsy curses should be entertaining but the weight-losing gone bad? Nope. Except Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDowell other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film does so too. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible he is fat too haha! The Thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moans how he/she has never seen anything so disgusting than fatness. Hey I can only say: Well look at the mirror.',neg
'Andy Milligan the independent movie maker from New York directs this little treat as his version of the Sweeney Todd legend. Sweeney slits the throats of customers in his barbershop and his cohort Mrs. Lovett turns them into meat pies. Thankfuly I was well-informed of the plot prior to seeing this film travesty. Milligan for my money has to indeed be running in the lead of worst directors of all-time race. Ed Wood looks like Orson Welles in comparison. This movie is so bad in oh so many ways. Lets take Milligans direction for starters. The film quality is grainy. The sound quality is grainy. Many scenes look as if Milligan was using a camcorder to film. The credits say Photograped and directed by Andy Milligan. He wants to take credit for ceilings showing up after a death scene? How about the atrocious musical score selected for the film? The film cuts with one poor transition after another. Little logic is used in the creation of the plot. The story has little to do with the actual legend of Todd. The murder scenes are plentiful but not horrifying in any way. Hands legs and other appendages are cut with the skill in which the editing was done: choppily! And lets take the breast in the pie scene. Yes it is in there. The pie maker didnt know that an entire breast with nipple filled an entire pie crust? Later we hear from our characters that they have been careful not to get caught for the 200 plus murders they have done. Obviously they are a couple of boobs not able to keep abreast of what is going on(sorry it was too tempting). The actors are not too terribly bad to be honest. Some even have glimmers of talent and all seem to be genuine English articles. Many non-erotic nude scenes are forced throughout. Milligan seemingly has some issues regarding sex. Plot strands are left untied. The ending is almost unwatchable due to poor camera work. I could go on and on. Did I like anything about the film? Not much to be truthful. I have a high level of acceptance for films of this ilk in terms of low budgets and marginal talent but this film lacks any real purpose other than to be crude and sick.',neg

'For those of you whove wondered what an art-house monster movie might be like wonder no more. The DAIMAJIN trilogy circa 1966 was just such a series. More period samurai epics than anything else these three movies just also happen to feature one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. Theres not a single facet of these gems that is unpolished from the scenario(s) to the performances to the filmmakers craftsmanship. Even the special effects are handled with well-above-average skill and are integrated (in most instances) almost seamlessly into the movie(s). If youre a GOJIRA fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie regardless of genre I highly recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.',pos

'This movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies I have seen... The acting was utterly superb and when I wasnt drying my tears I enjoyed Meryl Streep whos performance was extraordinary.

The soundtrack fits this movie to a tee. Brava Bette Midler!! Out of 5 stars I give this one 4 1/2.',pos
'movie I have ever seen. Actually I find it one of the more entertaining episodes of MST 3000 I have seen. Not that it was good but for anyone who has seen Manos: the Hands of Fate knows this one wasnt two bad. The monster in the movie looked terrible everyone wore upsetting swim suits and the plot was laughable. I still dont have a clue as to why they made the monster they never really gave a good reason. The lead female had to be the scrawniest gal I have ever seen. They would have done better if they cast the gal that was killed at the beginning as the lead. On the plus side the dolphins acting was great!!!',neg
'Beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory Manufactured Landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. Its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. That there might be a connection between the present-day Asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentioned.<br /><br />At the same time theres an effort to present Edward Burtynskys photographs of industrial waste as somehow beautiful. Much of the film is a slide show of these images. They are well produced of museum size and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions. To me however they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship if any between the photographs and the films spoken message remains unclear.<br /><br />I dont mean to imply that there arent real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize. Manufactured Landscapes however offers only strange and bitter hopelessness. Its like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Maybe it has some value as a demonstration of whats wrong with the American (and Canadian) Left.',neg
'I watched Asterix and Obelix in Operation Cleopatra which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic. Like the comic the whole movie is full of jokes based upon puns anachronistic jokes and slapstick gags which rarely fall flat.<br /><br />Asterix and Obelix are Gauls who use a strength potion to fight the Roman legions in their native Gaul. Here they end up in Egypt helping a friend build Cesars palace (yes its puny) in three months to prove the Egyptians are just as good as the Romans.<br /><br />The reason I picked this up was because Monica Belluci is Cleopatra. Shes good but the role is little more than a cameo. However even though shes rarely in the film I didnt care since its so clever and the jokes so funny I was in hysterics. I loved it. I loved it so much that I cant understand why the movies have never been released in the United States.<br /><br />The import DVD has the film in English dub- which is quite good especially when you consider that when you watch it in the longer French version the puns (and hence the jokes) are not always apparent since they are aural so if you read the names wrong the jokes are lost. Most of the jokes between the full French version and the shorter English dub seem to be exactly the same though some have been changed sometimes for the better and some times for the worse. Personally Im gonna stick with the dub when I watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor.<br /><br />You really will want to see this if you love puns and low brow but clever humor This is a great comedy',pos
'I have to confess that I am severely disappointed.<br /><br />This version can in no way compete with the version of 1995. The reason why I watched it was that I wasnt entirely happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the Captain I had imagined when I read the book. And he was too.<br /><br />Unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film. The rest is as un-Austen-like as possible.<br /><br />Miss Elliot would NEVER have run through the streets of Bath like this. It wasnt in her character and it just wasnt done by a lady of the those times. The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst.<br /><br />Although there are 3 important quotes from the book they are at entirely inappropriate moments warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed.<br /><br />And although this version is not much shorter than the other one it feels like everything is rushed. Very little care was taken to introduce the characters show their dispositions and motives. Important scenes were omitted. How could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way ? A disaster ! And it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one.<br /><br />No no no. If you love Austen then dont waste your time with this.',neg
'The Last Hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to deal with Buffalo hunting both as a sport and business and as a method of winning the plains Indian wars. Before the white man set foot on the other side of the Mississippi the plains used to have herds of American Bison as large as some of our largest cities. By the time of the period The Last Hunt is set in the buffalo had been all but wiped out. The 20th century due to the efforts of conservationists saw a revival in population of the species but not hardly like it once was.<br /><br />Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger are co-starring in a second film together and this one is far superior to All the Brothers Were Valiant. Here Stewart Granger is the good guy a world weary buffalo hunter who has to go back to a job he hates because of financial considerations.<br /><br />The partner hes chosen to throw in with is Robert Taylor. Forgetting Taylor for the moment I doubt if theres ever been a meaner nastier soul than Charlie Gilsen who Taylor portrays. In Devils Doorway he was an American Indian fighting against the prejudice stirred up by a racist played by Louis Calhern. In The Last Hunt hes the racist here. He kills both buffalo and Indians for pure pleasure. He kills one Indian family when they steal his mules and takes the widow of one captive. Like some barbarian conqueror he expects the pleasure of Debra Pagets sexual favors. Hes actually mad when Paget doesnt see it that way.<br /><br />No matter how often they refer to Russ Tamblyn as a halfbreed I was never really convinced he was any part Indian. Its the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt.<br /><br />However Lloyd Nolan the grizzled old buffalo skinner Taylor and Granger bring along is just great. Nolan steals every scene hes in with the cast. <br /><br />For those who like their westerns real who want to see a side of Robert Taylor never seen on screen and who dont like cheap heroics The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.',pos
'In 1955 Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon. One year later he walked out of the jungle...naked. It took him 45 years to go back. Supposedly Keep the River On your Right is a modern cannibal tale. In reality anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. The first half of the movie is more like a travel log of New Ginuea mostly touting the native art. The second half relies on still photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe but really thats about it. Unless of course you are interested in home movies of a Jewish wedding or Schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment and not really a modern cannibal tale. - MERK',neg

This film instead is a satire and it is doing great.<br /><br />Too bad that all expletives were *beeped* out while this movie aired on public tv that takes a lot of fun out of it.

'STMD! is not a terrible movie but it IS quite forgettable. The lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain. Special effects are imaginative but obvious. The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there of course along with the archetypical teenagers but the whole movie just doesnt gel. What was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor.<br /><br />I cant really recommend that you use your time watching this movie. I often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor but these are sadly lacking in this film.',neg

No great jokes except for the one-liners weve all heard a million times by now.<br /><br />I recently bought the DVD in hopes that it would be the gem I remembered it being. Well I was WAY off! The soundtrack had only 2-3 widely-recognizable hits (not the smash compilation others had mentioned) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible. The only thing that was interesting to me was predicting what the characters lines were before they said them. Yep I watched this movie that much back then! <br /><br />The only reason I am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten sorry to say. :(',neg
'This movies origins are a mystery to me as I only know as much as IMDB did before I rented it. I assume that before Starship Troopers Killshot was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network cable or otherwise. The new title of Kill Shot is comically thrown into the opening sequence the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema. The quick cuts cheesy Melrose Place music and short 2-second close-up candid shots of the main actors let you know what youre in for.<br /><br />And I dont mind at all. I rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the SciFi travesty of Starship Troopers (an excellent book in my opinion not so hot a movie - but thats another review). After looking it up on IMDB my roommate and I surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of Troopers and Richards own career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here). They threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted R-rated status - coveted in suspense Video Rental sections that is. In any event they should have left it unrated if youre trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section.<br /><br />All in all its entertaining. I hate to spoil the fun of telling you its a TV pilot though. That was the biggest pull while watching it - when you expect a cinematic movie and get a TV show the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual.<br /><br />Would I rent it again? No. Would I watch this TV show? Well why not - its better than Baywatch. And their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s. Token black guy (whos gay to avoid the TV taboo of inter-racial dating) token Asian (Japanese I assume from the name Koji) more adept at science and computers than talking to women beautiful intelligent Latina pre-med student who has everything going for her except her familys bank account - this show probably would have done ok.<br /><br />But as a movie it just cracks me.<br /><br />I gave it a 7 out of 10 considering what it was and what it was forced to become. It made for a very enjoyable evening and thats all I ask of rentals.',pos
'Okay...its 2005 and when you finally get to look at this film you will probably exclaim that it is dated. But heres the thing the screenplay was bold the exposure of the music industry at that time was as bold as well...and it took some time for this to get music that was created by African Americans to be promoted on the same level as white acts. In some cases it still is - but back in the 70s this film addressed some of the background many never knew. Now weve got American Idol - Pop Idol and other such things that allow us into the minds of the record execs and how they think they should market something that sells and not market talent.<br /><br />When I was a kid I loved the Earth Wind and Fire release of Thats the Way of the World which contained some of their biggest hits: Shining Star Reasons Yeanin Learnin and the title. Little did I know this was a SOUNDTRACK of a MOVIE...until I moved to Los Angeles and got the wonderful Z Channel.<br /><br />The Z Channel showed this film as part of a Harvey Keitel retrospective. Gee I had no idea Harvey Keitel DID so many movies -- and when I saw this one I was surprised. This movie is not a cinematic masterpiece but it does deserve more merit than it got. Its a nice little film. More than a vanity piece for Earth Wind and Fire Harvey Keitel does a great job as a torn record executive trying to fight the system. There are a lot of lessons to be drawn from this and a lot of insider trade that was exposed.<br /><br />If you can find this uncut...its worth a look.',pos
'Riding Giants is an amazing movie. It really shows how these people lived back then just to surf. Their lives were basically surfing living breathing and having fun. They didnt care about money jobs girls or any thing. To them the waves were their girls. I have never been on a surf board and it looks so hard I dont understand how they can stay on them it makes no sense at all. This is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie. If youre a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing how it came into life who is really famous at it or what ever then you should really see it. It might be a documentary but it is really good. -Tara F.-',pos
'I found it a real task to sit through this film. The sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. There was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie. These conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together. It is rare that I rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking so what and why did I waste my time watching this.',neg

'A spoiler.<br /><br />What three words can guarantee you a terrible film? Cheap Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Terrible script idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every BAD movie fan. The horror is hilarious. The post production team looks like it gave up. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half it actually tries to be good! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke?<br /><br />Its around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The day later a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />If a cop s head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it who would you believe?

'The only thing more full of holes than this movies premise is its script. Flatliners is the ideal showcase for Joel Schumachers glorious flamboyant brazen lack of talent. The plot is totally illogical but super fake-ponderous and everything is art-directed within an inch of its life in the most clichéd overheated way. I love how the med school autopsy room is a cavernous vaulted marble mausoleum low-lit in red with huge Rembrandt paintings hanging from the walls. I love how Keifer Sutherland drives a canvas-backed army jeep. No one in Joel Schumachers movies lives in an un-eccentric manner. Its always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painfully hip but hip strictly and obsessively according to an out-of-touch middle-aged billionaire man-childs idea of hip. And holy crap! The part where Baldwin brother #16 dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women hes slept with who intone Ill call you and I just need some space is the funniest friggin thing in the whole universe!!!! What kind of a world do we live in where Joel Schumacher gets to keep having people throw money at him?

'Heart of Darkness Movie Review Joseph Conrads Heart of Darkness is pretty dark deep and very profound. I would have to say reading the novel is way better than the movie. The character Mr. Kurtz played by John Malcovik was totally the wrong actor to do the part. He fit the character in Of Mice and Men. The movie left out man key parts that I consider important to get the true message of the story.<br /><br />The movie is poorly edited. It shows a lot of non-important and annoying flashes. In the novel it has a very suspenseful atmosphere but in the movie it lacks that kind of feeling. In the book there is so much that was left to the imagination of the reader. For example when Marlow spent timeless hours and days waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie. In the novel Marlow waited very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat. This was a big source of futility in the novel. The movie added more parts that were useless and kind of didnt make sense. For example when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz snapped the monkeys neck and killed him. That kind of just ruined everything didnt make any sense to me what so ever. So my suggestion to you is dont view the movie just read the book. You will understand more and have a better interpretation of the story.<br /><br />~Chris C.',neg
'The funky yet strictly second-tier British glam-rock band Strange Fruit breaks up at the end of the wildnwacky excess-ridden 70s. The individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90s: morose keyboardist Stephen Rea winds up penniless and down on his luck vain neurotic pretentious lead singer Bill Nighy tries (and fails) to pursue a floundering solo career paranoid drummer Timothy Spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt and surly bass player Jimmy Nail installs roofs for a living. Former loving groupie turned patient understanding long-suffering manager Juliet Aubrey gets the group back together for an ill-advised largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of Europe. Our lovably ragged bunch try gamely but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day. Scraggly zonked-out roadie Billy Connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist Hans Matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy trouble-plagued but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride.<br /><br />Director Brian Gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud ringing flamboyantly overblown preening 70s rock in general this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big-hearted charm and tireless verve. The astute sharply written script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais likewise bristles with spot-on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow. Ashley Rowes lovely elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right-on rockin flair and aplomb. Kudos also to the across-the-board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt-out soul and tattered but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has-been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success. All in all this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90s.',pos

A boy fighting off spies/terrorists when hes home alone in a Chicago suburb with the chickenpox? Ridiculous! Why did this film have to be made?

'This story was probably one of the most powerful I have ever taken in. John Singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performances by the whole cast but Epps and Rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young stars career.<br /><br />However as a college student myself many of the issues that Singleton touched on were taken to the extreme. In a sense that while they are issues faced on many college campuses they arent presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe. In some instances it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur. However aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic the film was brilliant and left me stunned unable to talk just think. One of the things from this picture I will remember forever was a quote from Lawrence Fishburns character Knowledge is power without knowledge you cannot see your power. Brilliant just brilliant.',pos

'Yeah I get Pasolini and his milieu but at the same time I feel his Decameron is largely overrated and more than a little disturbing. Overrated because the supposed realism he introduces (milling crowds crumbling architecture etc.) are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave. In the pursuit of realism Pasolini utilized many non-actors but their deer-in-the-headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off-kilter and inconsistent feel. And frankly -- many of the toothless misshapenly-featured people are painful to look at.<br /><br />And Pasolinis Decameron is disturbing (to me at least) because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content. Not because Im prudish or homophobic (Im neither) but because the emphasis that Pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo-realism he otherwise espouses so it comes off as gratuitous and forced. One can almost hear him say Ooh--Ive got to stick a cute naked boy in this scene! At times it seems that Pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself regardless of what his audience might prefer.<br /><br />The disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolinis Decameron struck me as being a failing of Pasolini as a storyteller rather than being an aspect of neo-realism. He seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction. Even the Pasolinis final line of dialog in the film which some people seem to find pithy (Why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter?) -- to me it just makes me wonder why Pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way? In my opinion a far better-crafted film (and with MORE homosexual content) is Fellinis Satyricon. It is also full of bizarre-looking people and absurd situations but it succeeds because of its pacing direction and strong storytelling whereas Decameron fails by those same elements.',neg

The first time in it`s unrated version which is soft-core porn at it`s best and the second time in a trimmed down (cut all the sex and most of the nudity out) version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way. The unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with Nikki Fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world (no pun intended). Unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes. Rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars (Stallone Sheen Travolta etc;) trying to act. We also get appearances by B-queen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin from the old Batman series).',pos
'This sequel to the above - and the final entry in the Kharis series - is slightly more enjoyable on the whole but its also more contrived (hell we even get a singing barmaid/hostess!): Peter Coe is easily the least charismatic of the various Egyptian high priests weve seen during the course of these films and Martin Kosleck as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings; Kurt Katch then is saddled with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated Princess Ananka: the latter in the form of Virginia Christine (later a much-used character actress) gets her most substantial role and indeed the sequence of her resurrection from the swamps is a highlight not only of this film but the entire series. Unfortunately here too Chaney has precious little to do as once again the emphasis is on Ananka as Ive said; his Mummy (to which he returned most often at Universal - apart naturally from his signature role of The Wolf Man!) remains without a doubt his least memorable monster for the studio.',neg
'I have to say I quite enjoyed Soldier. Russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity. Very watchable and nowhere near as bad as Id been led to believe. Yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment.',pos
'Kings Solomons Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain)who has spent a lot of time in Africa but decides it is time to return to England and be a father to his son. He finds that his wifes parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit. In comes Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth) whose father is in Africa and being held by an African tribe for ransom of the map Elizabeths father had sent her. Elizabeth seeks out Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father.<br /><br />There is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want the map also.<br /><br />The movie holds your attention until the end. Patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion loss and despair the rugged silent good man anger and strength; In King Solomons Minds his character actually smiles a few times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again one in which he doesnt have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong. Maybe a little dancing would help. But this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it.',pos
'I read the book written by Bill Carter on which this movie is based many years ago. The book is certainly stronger than the movie. It provides more detail than a movie can possibly provide the end result being that I thought the movie seemed a wee bit sketchy on a handful of items. All things considered though and given the limitations of the medium the movie provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 90s to host The Tonight Show after the retirement of Johnny Carson.<br /><br />The highlight is clearly the performances. I can think of no more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and well-known and on TV on a regular basis. John Michael Higgins nailed the part of Letterman perfectly. Watching him really was like watching Letterman. Daniel Roebuck tried valiantly to be Jay Leno but somehow didnt pull it off as effectively. His whole look seemed fake and he just didnt seem natural in the role. In a less central role Rich Little not surprisingly nailed the voice of Carson although the look was a bit off. In the book the most interesting of the central figures was probably Lenos agent Helen Kushnick. In the movie Kathy Bates was perfect in the role although not quite as out of control as Carters portrayal of the woman in writing.<br /><br />In the end this is light and entertaining viewing. The subject matter isnt especially important in the overall scheme of things but its a fun behind the scenes look at a memorable time in the entertainment industry. 7/10',pos
'Not exactly my genre this straight-to-DVD street fight action is one I only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers. Im relatively open minded and quite a fan of Eamonn Walker so I sat back ready to enjoy myself.<br /><br />Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone an ex-con who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses. Blah blah blah.<br /><br />What a tedious film. I understand that films like this dont rely hugely on plot but do they have to stuff in such a silly predictable and entirely stupid storyline? It may not be important but by golly gum does it annoy me. Better no plot and pure action than a clíche-ridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative. Infused with entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin-skinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards. I should probably at this point mention what is of course the films drawing point: the fighting. Even in itself the fighting is rather poor. Bone manages to take out well established tough-man street fighters in single punches (a large oaf or two is the filmmakers laughworthy attempt to rectify this inconsistency); fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy. Even this is repetitive and stupid arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we get to see time and time again.<br /><br />A run of the mill film-by-numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to DVD status doing absolutely nothing new and everything weve seen time and time again. And not even particularly well.',neg
'First lets get the hoopla out of the way.Hedy Lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen.Here we have Hedy as a young fresh-faced 20 year old speaking in her native Austrian.I recently bought a 1990 uncensored version of this 1932/3 classic.Yes we see a brief close up of Hedy bare from the waist up but although she filmed the swimming & runaway horse scenes naked the director Gustav Machaty uses the cover of branches reflections in puddles medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene; so dont go imagining there are any lascivious close ups or clinches.Her boyfriend  Pierre Nay keeps his clothes on at all times.Yes fairly daring for its day but how innocous it looks now through 2003 eyes.<br /><br />As other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the imagary expressionism and allegorical statements it makes with pictures of drops of water forming a ripple on the surface of a pale of water farm machinery landscapes etc.Sweet sounding strings run for most of Extases length and the film has a feel of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept.The script is highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium of facial and bodily gestures with just a few words of German spoken by the actors with English subtitles beneath.Even these few words seem almost superflous in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film.<br /><br />Put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man (why we are never told and what did Eva see in him anyway?Money?) who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage.She then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law.After a ride on her horse Eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her horses saddle.However her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off to greet its stablemate.Hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her mount but an engineer at work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner.And so the romance is born.Her husband seeing that his rival must win Eva later decides to shoot himself but I thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous loveless relationship with Eva.<br /><br />Despite being a 1990 reissue title on VHS the sound being 70 years old is a bit soft and with background crackles in line with films of its age.After a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with Eva he imagines her as a mother with an infant so we have to assume they live happily ever after.Just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind of the style of films even of late 1930s vintage.This is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title.I gave it 7/10.',pos

'I disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as just entertainment. Set right after the carefree roaring 20s during the early days of the Great Depression Dance Fools Dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times. Yet this fast-paced and tightly-plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale.<br /><br />In the 30s Hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining *and* enlightening audience-pleaser after another all without wasting a frame of film. Dance Fools Dance -- one of *four* films that Harry Beaumont directed in 1931 -- is barely 80 minutes long yet its characters are well developed its story never seems rushed and despite its many twists in plot the audience is never left behind.<br /><br />With the lone exception of Lester Vail as flaccid love interest Bob Townsend the supporting cast is uniformly strong. Worthy of note are William Bakewell as Crawfords brother Cliff Edwards (best known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket) as reporter Bert Scranton and Clark Gable in an early supporting role as gangster Jake Luva.<br /><br />But this is Joan Crawfords film and she absolutely shines in it. Made when she was just 27 this lesser-known version of Crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work. However here is proof that long before she took home an Oscar for Mildred Pierce Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself.<br /><br />Score: EIGHT out of TEN',pos
'I think it was way back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and I saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing teen deviyan. We decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great. But we were in for a pleasant surprise. The movie was made in 1965 but even by todays standards the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times. The music was wonderful and Dev Anand as a city bred looked and acted his best. I still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over. <br /><br />Whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time? No he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons. One is homely one is an actress and the third is a high society girl who can also help Dev in his career as a poet. The question is which one is the One for him. What makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too. When things come to an impasse a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision.<br /><br />This dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black-n-white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today. If you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact. In case you watch this movie without this part and get confused dont worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.',pos
'I almost never comment on movies but I saw the 5 glowing reviews of this movie and decided I had to weigh in with my own review. An instructor of mine received this film in the mail mixed in with his Academy screeners (AMPAS aka the guys who vote on the Oscars) and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how NOT to put together a movie.<br /><br />This film has no plot the scenes are horribly horribly edited (oftentimes using faux 24 style picture-in-picture techniques) and the performances (particularly the lead who even fails at acting like a bad actress) are for the most part obnoxious. Someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction namely the setting up of the plot. There is no setup! Halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about. The opening crane shot which sets up some kind of murder is never addressed and now that I think about it was possibly meant to be a flash-forward with the rest of the film being a flashback but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such.<br /><br />Bah I could really go on and on. At the very least this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film-making ability.',neg
'Another very good Mann flick thanks to the father/son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comedic conscience of either Stewart or Wayne (Red River/ Rio Bravo). Hes there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend. Youre wrong Mr. Dunston. Jeff Webster(Stewart) gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as the law of Skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it. Another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people. The loner can do neither and suffers for it.<br /><br />The caption above plays on Tatums assertion that he cant live without his coffee. This nicotine addiction proves fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen.<br /><br />I recommend this film and now own the DVD.',pos
'Im no horror movie buff but my wifes nieces and nephews are. So I saw the first movie. It was gruesome and tense but not my taste. Still good though. For similar reasons at this very moment I am being exposed to a sequel.<br /><br />The premise itself is beyond absurd. I can buy that disasters occur in the desert. I can buy that mutants exists. I can even buy that the events might be so weird and strange that the military may decide to get involved. It is unlikely yes but Im willing to suspend my belief.<br /><br />HOWEVER under no circumstances am I willing to believe that the military squad assigned to recon such an area would be unable to fend off the mutants. Being a member of the United States Army I can assure that while fresh recruits may lack the seasoned eyes and experience of combat soldiers any such recruits would be integrated into a capable squad.<br /><br />A squad of armed soldiers is not about to be taken out by a few mutants with knives. Thats just the way it works. Squad movements vastly superior firepower and of course radio support would ensure nothing less than total victory. Im not saying you wouldnt have casualties but as soon as the area was verified as hostile military training would take precedence no-one would go off on their own even to use the bathroom.<br /><br />And if it were discovered that the area was so infested with hostiles that the squad was unable to handle the danger they would radio in for backup. And believe me their radios would not be jammed if there was a chance that normal radios would not do the squad would have a military issue satellite phone. Chances are if they were unable to check in every hour a search would be called.<br /><br />In order to accept this movie you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools with incompetent leaders and an incompetent chain of command. While it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and compass our military forces are filled with intelligent well-trained competent soldiers. Mutants with knives are far below our ability to deal with.<br /><br />With the whole execution of the movie depending solidly on the impossible to imagine the film fails to deliver. Instead we are expected to believe that our soldiers sailors and airmen are incapable of dealing with even the most mediocre threats.<br /><br />As a combat veteran I find the movie insulting.',neg
'This all-but-ignored masterpiece is about the Monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie (Head) and that everything they do or say had already been written in an (unseen) script they seem to be following. Head was written by Jack Nicholson Rafelson and Peter Tork during a three-day LSD trip in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel. The other three Monkees only acted in it.<br /><br />They fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script. They deliberately flub their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason; and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. <br /><br />For instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch frame-by-frame you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror. He is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the Director yells cut!<br /><br />The Monkees however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are. That ends up being the core of the Revelation soon to come.<br /><br />At every turn they realize their increasingly-bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they cant escape being in. You say they went crazy and walked through the sky (which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the sets background)? No problem! Hey hey theyre the Monkees and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around! <br /><br />In the end even their deaths did not set them free. That was how the movie was supposed to end and their motionless waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river put in another box and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production.<br /><br />This is made all the more poignant by the fact that the Monkees really ARE fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world. They did it through the power of their music.<br /><br />Ironically near the end Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem but unfortunately no one listens. <br /><br />Peter realizes: It doesnt MATTER if were in the box (the film). He means that it doesnt matter if will is free or illusory and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur... You need to just let now HAPPEN as it happens without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is valid by some abstract definition.<br /><br />When you cant even tell the difference will being free or not doesnt matter--tying to figure out if you are the real you is just a pointless waste of time.<br /><br />I saw this film at a very important time in my life. I was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun (i.e. sex) like everyone else did. But the revelation in Head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork will ever know.<br /><br />For decades Ive watched Head and wished I could thank Pete.<br /><br />Was this a good movie?<br /><br />Uhh how about like...<br /><br />==< YES >==',pos
'Better than I expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial bondage. The music is great and cinematography focuses greatly on turning Ricci into a trailer trash Betty Paige and it works. Samuel L. gets to shout a lot which hes good at as well as play lots of blues guitar which he looks cool doing. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. I get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s*\%# but instead managed to just barley carve out its own odd little transgressive pulp niche while still being an effective drama.',pos
'I felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through since I had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own but I came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money I had paid for it. If you are a fan of gore and sadism this movie is OK. If there is one thing that the makers of this film know it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect. If that doesnt thrill you then stay away.<br /><br />This movie is shot on a home video camera with grade school props and terrible actors. Its dubbed from German but even allowing for that the sound is awful. This film is about as budget as budget gets except for the aforementioned special effects. If they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts the film might have been a little more enjoyable.<br /><br />The story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin-masked sadists. They are captured and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape. I call this a story in the loosest sense since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenity-filled dialog.<br /><br />There is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie unless you like mindless gore. Consider yourself warned.',neg
'Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women. His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. He also did a Loretta Young suspense thriller Cause For Alarm a couple of years earlier. The play Dinelli wrote was originally entitled The Man and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season. It was Dinellis only effort on Broadway and it starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. <br /><br />The roles that Gish and Boone played are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference. Dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen so Im wondering what he thought about that. Certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story.<br /><br />That wasnt the only thing that was eliminated. The people are all wearing period clothing from around World War I yet theres no reference at all to the time this story takes place in. I thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to Ida Lupinos residence I noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era.<br /><br />The film is almost entirely set within Ida Lupinos home where shes hired an itinerant stranger in Robert Ryan as a handyman. The film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupino in her home for about a day.<br /><br />Both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made. Films like Beware My Lovely are the stuff that a small studio like RKO did best. If this were done at MGM or Paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story.',pos
'Im sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview (yes SOS...) Why you could play full-court basketball in the torpedo room its so large. And how bout the bay windows in the bow the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere? Did I mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder? And the Admirals stateroom with what appears to be a loft? Big bleeping sub...<br /><br />OK OK...its never gonna win any prizes for authenticity. And if the sub is laughable the plot is even worse. Somehow the Van Allen belts of radiation hundreds of miles in space have caught fire are going to make global warming look like a weenie roast. Pompous Admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon) along with his sidekick Lucius (Peter Lorre looking suitably uncomfortable) hatch a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile into its midst.<br /><br />Theres plenty of intrigue (sic) along the way with a born-again survivor (and his little dog too!) two dames who can never leave well enough alone a passel of red shirts who are expendable and plot holes big enough for Godzilla to walk through. Thrill to the Seaview being chased at what looks like 60 miles per hour by another sub -- no need for advanced sonar when you can follow from 100 feet astern.<br /><br />The movie careens from one cliff-hanger to another; the payoff is so anticlimactic as to be pointless certainly not worth the 1 hour and 50 minute wait.<br /><br />The technical adviser for this shipwreck must have been a 14-year old boy with a stack of Popular Mechanics magazines. Worth watching if only to riff upon.',neg
'Look this is quite possibly one of the best movies America has to offer the rest of the world. To hate this movie is to hate freedom itself. I remember that the early 80s were a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak communism threatened us all and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. Out of that confusion came a hero Stroker Ace. Ned Beattys performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness. His triumph is an inspiration to all. The on-screen chemistry between Burt and Loni draws obvious comparisons to Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go see this movie tonight!',pos
'This is strictly for Pryor fans. Just because he was a great funny guy doesnt mean this is more than a B-Movie. The script is awful it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war. It balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither. <br /><br />First there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic uninspired Vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point... How more can you pander to your audience?... That prison time is boring unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep. <br /><br />Back in the U.S. the guy for no real reason at all is considered a war hero. Yet he is of course quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be stumbling into all kinds of wacky mishaps. Or are they really? We will soon find out. Yawn. There are annoying clichés: his sick mother his little daughter he never meets a high end whore falling in love with the hero etc. It is very odd how this movie constantly switches from tragedy to slapstick in one instant. Doesnt work at all. <br /><br />Overall this in fact is just a bad comedy and does a disservice to prisoners of war. Just because this guy was a great stand-up comedian played in a few good movies and died of MS is no reason not to be annoyed by this silly unconvincing unfunny comedy. But if you like Richard Pryor you will probably be thrilled by him reading 3 hours of Dadaist poetry.',neg
'Drab dreary and a total waste of my time. The plot is incomprehensible (so dont think about it too much). The acting is odd and wooden - I would have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting but that might be an insult to body builders. There are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster but lots of fires explosions a gratuitous sex scene etc. The only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the US and Iraq that somehow goes nuclear...hmmm. Is Roger Corman psychic? Lets hope that Iraq was just a lucky choice for Corman and that the rest of his scenario doesnt come true. <br /><br />',neg

'The Kissing Bandit was the third and final film that Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson co-starred at MGM with. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and It Happened in Brooklyn. And in both Sinatra wooed and lost Grayson. I guess the third times the charm.<br /><br />For romance maybe but definitely not for screen image. Sinatra in his fortys films once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in toreador pants. Poaching on Tyrone Powers territory laid out in The Mark of Zorro Sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner by day and The Kissing Bandit by night. Hes gone and left California for an education and has come back ready to take Dads place but in the hotel business only. And where does he learn the hotel business Boston.<br /><br />Of course some of Dads former gang members grown a little old and paunchy led by J. Carrol Naish want him to lead the gang again. But Franks just not cut out for the outlaw life. But he does make a good impression on the Governors daughter Kathryn Grayson.<br /><br />Somebody must have had it in for Sinatra at MGM to cast him in this after the bad reviews he got in Miracle of the Bells. Franks in a part that was more suitable for Red Skelton. But since this was a musical I guess the brain trust at MGM figured Kathryn Grayson had to have a singing co-star.<br /><br />In fact the best number in the film are for her Love Is Where You Find It. Also Ricardo Montalban Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse do a dance specialty that is nice. Franks songs are nice but nothing spectacular.<br /><br />In later years Sinatra would wince at the mention of The Kissing Bandit and with good reason.',neg

'I question its importance to Queer Cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence.<br /><br />Three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner. I found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes that alone didnt sit well with me. Weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times.<br /><br />There was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film. More like a 45 minute Boys Brief short rather than a fleshed out full-length film. It had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts.<br /><br />The 1st part: Boxer/Stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin. Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he confronting him? I felt as though their cat-mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion. We needed more information about them and less Parking Lot/Locker scenes with Tim relentlessly saying What do you want? <br /><br />The 2nd part: Danny wants his buddy Tony to beat him up while he jacks-off. Tony doesnt seem to mind but he doesnt even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby -- not even after they do it in the nude. This tale lacks the all-important transition from Im a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to I think I might be gay and hitting him because Id like to spread his ass and do him S/M style. A very important thing to leave out.<br /><br />Clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time. The 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought. Furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film. Yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy. The make-up (bruises and cuts) however was on par with a grammar school talent show.<br /><br />There wasnt enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic. The film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment. Its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously.',neg

'The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESKIMO hunter.<br /><br />W. S. Van Dyke MGMs peripatetic director was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the Arctic among the Inuit. His production was on location filming from April 1932 until November 1933 (although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place back at the Studio). While considered a documentary at the time we would likely term it a docudrama as it is scripted with an intriguing plot & storyline.<br /><br />The film shows the daily life of the Eskimo both Winter & Summer and in fact starts in the warmer time of the year without any snow or ice in sight. The constant striving for food is depicted and the viewer gets to watch the exciting hunts for walrus polar bear whale & caribou. The native language is used throughout with the use of title cards; the only English is spoken by the fishermen & Mounties encountered by the Eskimo. In fact it is the arrival of White Men both good & bad and the change they make on Eskimo society which is a major element in the narrative.<br /><br />This Pre-Code film deals in a refreshingly frank manner with the Eskimo moral code particularly with their practice of wife-sharing which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life which was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930s.<br /><br />None of the cast receives screen credit which is a shame as there are some notable performances. Foremost among them is that of Ray Wise playing the leading role of Mala the Eskimo. Wise (1906-1952) was an Alaskan Native of Inuit ancestry and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part. As handsome as any Hollywood star he would continue acting using the name of Ray Mala in a sporadic film career often in tiny unbilled roles.<br /><br />Lovely Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays Malas loyal second wife; the names of the fine actresses playing his other two wives are now obscure. Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict North West Mounted Police inspector. The two decent-hearted Mounties who must deliver Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer & Edgar Dearing both longtime movie character actors. Danish author Peter Freuchen upon whose books the film was based has a short vivid role of an evil wooden-legged sea captain who unwisely rouses Malas icy wrath.',pos
'Amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70s and this from leading horror scribe Robert Bloch is one of their best efforts. There are four stories all worthwhile but two -- Sweets For The Sweet and Method For Murder -- distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear.<br /><br />In Sweets Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter (Chloe Franks) becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since Martin Stephens in The Innocents. This installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage occurring off-screen is a moment of purest horror.<br /><br />Method of Murder is about a horror novelist (Denholm Elliott) who is menaced by one of his own creations the creepy Dominic. This episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror. Dominic may or may not be real so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. The brief shots of Dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting.<br /><br />The original poster art featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding Peter Cushings severed head was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear.',pos
'I find the critique of many IMDb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to GET AWAY from it all.<br /><br />In this case however I have to say it was BAD. I am a SciFi junkie and there was NOTHING in this movie that grabbed me for even one second.<br /><br />There was no proper storyline. I may be an idiot but I still do not know where the GOVERNMENT was that was so worried about these pieces.<br /><br />The pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these 3 pieces is scary. Half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third. A 3 year old kid would have been able to put them together.<br /><br />This movie was BAD.<br /><br />Dominic',neg
'A few years ago I bought several $1 DVDs that contained two movies each. One of them had Three Broadway Girls (an alternate title for The Greeks Had a Word for Them) and this one Happy Go Lovely. Its basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in Scotland and concerns mistaken identity involving one of the dancers hitching a ride from a millionaires limousine. Vera-Ellen is that dancer and-wow what legs! Ceasar Romero is her producer who takes a chance on her after the original leading lady leaves because he thinks shes dating the millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is that rich guy who when looking for Vera-Ellen is mistaken for a reporter whos supposed to interview her but gets stalled by Romero. What Ive just mentioned may be confusing but (mostly) makes sense if youre willing to check your brain while watching this charmingly screwball comedy with wonderful musical numbers as performed by the exquisite Ms. Vera-Ellen. Romero can be a bit frantic here but Niven becomes hilariously bemused throughout. The print I saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that its in public domain. And Vera-Ellen does pretty well with her lines since shes not really an actress. So on that note I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely for movie buffs who love old-fashioned musical comedies.',pos
'An absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage Russian animation pioneer Wladyslaw Starewiczs Mest kinematograficheskogo operatora (The Cameramans Revenge or The Revenge of a Kinematograph Cameraman) is a delight of early animation brimming with highly-effective stop-motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. Beetle have a completely uneventful marriage and both yearn for more excitement in their lives. Mr. Beetles desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the Gay Dragonfly night club whom he visits whenever he takes a business trip to the city. She is the only one who understands him. A fellow admirer of this dancer an aggressive grasshopper is jealous that Mr. Beetle has stolen his lady and as fate would have it he is also a movie cameraman. The devious grasshopper follows Mr. Beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room where he films their exploits through the keyhole.<br /><br />Meanwhile Mrs. Beetle has likewise acquired a friend to add excitement to her life. He is an artist and he brings her a painting for a present before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy. At that moment however Mr. Beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle. As Mr. Beetle bashes through the front door the artist friend clambers up the chimney but he doesnt escape without Mr. Beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him.<br /><br />There is a certain irony in the statement that follows: Mr. Beetle is generous. He forgives his wife and takes her to a movie. He is generous enough to forgive her and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier. At this point in time however we still havent forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film Mr. and Mrs. Beetle are attending. Suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of Mr. Beetles disloyalty and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper.<br /><br />In the final scene both Mr. and Mrs. Beetle now somewhat more appreciative of each other are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when Mr. Beetle sought his final revenge. We do indeed hope that the home life of the Beetles will be less exciting in the future This film may appear to be a mere story of the comings-and-goings of a miniscule insect species but Starewicz is communicating so much more than that. This isnt a story about beetles  it is a story about us. And its startlingly accurate isnt it?!',pos
'Having seen both Fear of a Black Hat and This is Spinal Tap I can honestly state that while similar both movies are truly must see. There will be many times in Fear that will have you in hysterics. It is no wonder why both movies have such a huge cult following. Fear will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you must but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.',pos
'I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere).<br /><br />A haunting intimate portrait of Loneliness and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker.<br /><br />The acting of the two leads (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged.<br /><br />Reminded me in theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where Im Calling From).<br /><br />The Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself.<br /><br />Highly recommend the Film and the Soundtrack.',pos

'Universals answer to The Exorcist isnt a very good one. Unfortunately the film offers bland unimaginative direction from Michael Winner who wastes an outstanding cast with a screenplay massing crater-sized plot-holes. Not to mention its unbearably silly never explaining certain key elements within the story.<br /><br />Model Cristina Raines moves into a high-rise owned by the Catholic Church with a creepy blind priest John Carradine who holes up in there always at the window. She begins to suffer faint spells and nausea. Whats worse is tenants she meets in the building such as Burgess Meredith(with a cat and a canary!)and a young Beverly DAngelo as a lesbian. Ava Gardner(looking great at 55)is the Realtor who showed Raines the place. Cristinas lover is Chris Sarandon whose wife committed suicide after finding out they were having an affair. José Ferrer has a small role as the Priest of the Brotherhood who informs Monsignor Arthur Kennedy to be careful as he heads to the very high-rise not only housing Carradine but Raines as well. Sarandon sends a hired-hand up to the high-rise one night to check out a certain room above Cristinas apartment where she heard metallic clanging and other loud racket. He winds up dead the very same night Cristina kills her DEAD father in a nightmare. Screaming mad on the street Cristina does indeed have blood on her which leads police detective Eli Wallach and partner Christopher Walken to investigate them with sure certainty that it all somehow leads back to Sarandon who is a hot-shot lawyer who once beat the cop in court regarding the whole wifes suicide. That case is really a motivating factor is Wallachs dogged approach to finding out whose blood was really on Cristina and if Sarandon has anything to do with it. You also have Martin Balsam as a professor who understands this type of Latin Cristina mysteriously understands and unbilled actors such as Jeff Goldblum as a fashion photographer and Tom Berenger as a man interested in this certain room that has become available in the very room(now renovated)that Cristina once stayed in! What bothers me more than anything is lack of explanation. Towards the end of the film Wallach and Walken are forgotten and we are left wondering why they just up and quit investigating. Their characters are just left on the back-burner. How the priests know that now is the time when a certain man will die and must be replaced to guard a certain gate in that high-rise and why Cristina suffers through the trauma she does isnt adequately explained. How certain ghosts just appear to Cristina and disappear when she tries to show Gardner the rooms they occupied during a cats birthday(see for yourself)isnt adequately explained. Not to mention Gardners role in the grand scheme of things..she brings people to that high-rise but what is really her reasons in the film? It seems like this film shouldve been longer and cleared things up left lost to a rushed conclusion that is just laughable when it should be scary.',neg
'The story concerns a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris) who is hired by her Estee Lauder-like cosmetic queen aunt. Her aunt (by marriage we are left to presume) is trying to track down her long lost family in Europe. All they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an ornate music box. The researcher heads to Europe and conducts her search in places like Milan Budapest and Vienna. The scenery is the real thing and is actually shot on location (unlike a Murder She Wrote where Jessica is supposed to be visiting a far-flung locale and Lansbury never left Burbank). Anyway she meets a young man who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own and they team up to track down clues and menace bad guys. The dialogue particularly the romantic dialogue is terrible. I watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that I stayed on just to see if it would get worse. It did. Acting was also off. I can see why Mel Harriss career never really took off after thirtysomething but she is adequate (seems too old for her co-star though). But the supporting players are straight out of the community playhouse. I also lost count of how many times they say Budapest to each other. Yes it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know okay? I realized halfway into the film that this had to be one of those Harlequin movies and sure enough it is. Guess that says it all.',neg
'Overall I would have to say that I liked the movie. Some of the fight scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. Otherwise Sammo copies Bruce Lees fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 Stars.',pos

'*****Spoilers herein*****<br /><br />What really scares you? Killer sharks or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message? Maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath?<br /><br />Maybe. But those fears dont even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of ones own child. Pet Sematary taps this base primal adult fear and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore.<br /><br />Ive read comments about this film that include poor acting characters making stupid decisions etc. I disagree. The acting is actually first rate for a film like this. Maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. But the films events are not only logical they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. This is the true horror of Pet Sematary: It isnt that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that Louis Creed does. Despite warning or even past history.<br /><br />The movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect. And the results are horrifying. In fact when the film dives into slasher territory near the end its almost a letdown although I believe its perfectly logical how it got there.<br /><br />I am a true horror fan and I contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made. If you dont think so see it again after you have children.',pos
'Writer/Director Peter Greenaway cements his title as the High Lord of Art House Pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self-indulgence 8 ½ Women. The film follows a wealthy Englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction as they lure and blackmail women (guess how many) into joining their personal collection of concubines.<br /><br />Think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive and chances are Greenaways done it. The female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of. Theres the Kabuki-obsessed Mio the ever-pregnant Giaconda and Beryl whos got a thing for farm animals. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair shes the half woman get it? Greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny but if this isnt it then what is?<br /><br />The film goes on to eroticize anything and everything having to do with Japan a continuation of themes from his snore-worthy (but less sexist) 1996 film The Pillow Book. But where the The Pillow Book was erotic and graceful 8 ½ Women just gets horny and exploitative. Greenaways work is tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur himself.',neg
'Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey Addams Family Values) wrote this frothy tale of a mild mannered school teacher (Kevin Kline) who is outted on the Academy Awards by a former student-turned-actor (Matt Dillon). The rest of the film deals with the absurdities revolving around this setup -the effect on the town his fiancee (Joan Cusack) himself- and climaxes with an everybody-loves-everybody finale.<br /><br /> If youre an angry gay rights activist or a naive youth looking for an accurate portrayal of a mans struggle to come out or a true depiction of gay life then save yourself the trouble and rent something else (maybe Beautiful Thing) or read a book (Giovannis Room). If you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the piousness of Tom Hankss speech on the Academy Awards when he won for Philadelphia and pokes fun at Hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a fondness for 30s screwball comedy (Bringing Up Baby Holiday The Palm Beach Story) then enjoy! Far from being a biting satire the film tries for the exuberance of a Preston Sturges farce and comes damn close. No its not deep or powerful -neither were Romy & Michelle 9 to 5 or Young Frankenstein- and it doesnt pretend to be; it keeps its tongue-firmly-in-cheek. It gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good toward the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit stale (theres also a locker room scene that could have been cut) but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire its like a breath of fresh air.<br /><br /> Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck are wonderfully game while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley add fine support. The excellent Joan Cusacks award winning performance is stellar and the great Bob Newhart is well Bob Newhart. <br /><br /> The fact that many have been offended by In & Out is as absurd as the mentality of the townsfolk it pokes fun at; personally I was more offended by Philadelphia. Ill take harmless fluff over sanctimoniousness anytime.',pos
'Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best film of the year. It was a complete and utter joy to watch. I was riveted. The whole audience up at the Sunset Five was riveted when the film ended no one moved spoke nothing. I think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has. Especially in so much as it sets an example of the quality of drama/ work of this younger generation. <br /><br />There were moments in your film many like at least seven where I was struck by such a great amount of beauty emotional beauty that I actually couldnt breathe for a while. And for a catharsis junkie like me thats about the best censorial experience I could ask for. It is the result of powerful masterful storytelling and direction. Like heavyweight stuff like Burtolucci and those guys. <br /><br />Each element of the film fit tightly together. There were no missteps at all. The cast was amazing. I have been a huge fan of Emiles and Ryans for a long time and I thought they have never been better. I was/am/will be continuously stunned by this film. And I promise I will drag every person I know to see it. It should be seen. It should win awards.',pos

'I bought this movie sight unseen at a sci-fi convention and I got what I deserved for doing something so silly. Simply put this movie is implausible boring and unwatchable.<br /><br />I was so bored and disgusted with the lack of plot development that I turned it off to watch a repeat of Mythbusters. I understand that this was a very low budget move or least it looked like a very low budget move but that does not excuse the horrible acting terrible plot and even worse camera work. It looks like something a group of college students did in between classes and getting drunk.<br /><br />Maybe if the villain wasnt so laughable and the plot was something that actually could happen in real life with respect to law enforcement it might become so bad its funny.

'I was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was. The school play where the leading actors kiss that happened at my school. A crazy gang of lads my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke! Getting the whack some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes! after that they were kept in a safe!!! And as for certain nocternal activities! what can I say.... The film actually came out in 1982 I remember that as it was when I bought my house and the film was showing at the same time. If you like British films and films about school growing up and period pieces then this is for you. Another film very much like it SWALK came out a few years before and I for one would like to see that again also Kes is in the genre. Highly recommended. (But trust me 1982 is when it came out)',pos
'Though I saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me. Stephen Reas depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving. His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable.

Each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers I think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers.',pos
'It pains me to see an awesome movie turn into some lame repetitive and lazy series. It is filled with plot holes and the plot is confusing in a BAD way. Whoever the prick writers were that decided to turn such a great movie into this garbage should have done some research instead of filling it with one-liners and hollow new characters and the classic jokes from the first movie OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Sure they get a little creative but its like seeing the same episode with a small twist. Pretty much like listening to Creed or Nickleback. Kuzco has to prevent himself from failing Yzma has a complicated plan but decides to go the easy way to save time and just use a potion someone questions the monkey and the bug Bucky appears in the background Kuzco flirts with Malina she disses him without sounding like a bitch Yzma disguises herself as Principal Amzy and she calls Kronk and he forgets that she is Yzma. I admit this show does have its moments. Another problem is the fact that Yzma looks younger and Pacha looks....weird. Also no one can replace David Spade and John Goodman! Their the ones who made Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry but i give this show two thumbs down.',neg
'210 minute version (extremely hardcore or so I hear) or the R-rated version released into theaters? Both are terribly awful of course. Peter OToole and Malcolm McDowell have both claimed they wish they had never made this film (the latter of the two men reported this in an IMDb interview!) and I can see why. Nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half-hearted attempt at a plot.<br /><br />Not much of anything here other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the film: It was like one moment Id be staring admiring my mule or something and the next scene would be two lesbians going at it.<br /><br />How true.<br /><br />What an awful movie.<br /><br />1/5 stars.',neg

'I feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk. The portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species. Their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized. Everyone is Napoleon or some other historical figure; or they have a fascination with chickens. They are on the make or beating each other up. Its as if the scriptwriter said what can I make up for them to do without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is. Watch the wonderful human portrayal in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest where the illnesses are believable and real. I once worked in a State Mental hospital. I didnt see any of these guys. These are too smart and calculating to make them come to life.',neg
'This movie is one of the worse movies of all time. Im kind of upset this movie isnt on the bottom 100; it deserves a spot at least number 60 or 70 on that list. This isnt just a film I think is bad in a campy-fun sort of MST3K way; its just bad. This is one of the few films that I really really HATE. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same category of bad.<br /><br />So the story in this one goes that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and comes back with Crawl (Shore) and he tries to learn to be a farmer. Then the boyfriend tries to set Shore up so that the girl will leave Crawl and go back to him. It ends and whats left of the audience can leave.<br /><br />The main purpose of this movie is for Pauly Shore to mug for the camera and try to be funny; but Id say about 100\% of the time he fails at that. Their horrible inaccurate and out of date view of farms and farming is offensive and theres nothing in this movie worth seeing. If you think of seeing it: dont. The one time I saw the movie it felt like I was watching it for 5 or 6 hours. If youve already seen it; you have my sympathy.',neg
'Junior high and high school teachers will find The Cure an excellent teaching tool both as a companion to Huckleberry Finn or as a stand-alone lesson. Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme the strong sup-text of friendship and love as they evolve between Eric and Dexter is a powerful message for teenagers. Writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. I also suggest directed class discussion about how Eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend.',pos
'I happened upon this flick on a rainy Sunday intending to tune-in to something else. Out of curiosity I accessed the comments here and found myself watching it to the end. I really didnt do so with intent -- this was one of those movies where youre fascinated and watch it for another couple of minutes until you finally just watch to the end. And the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view. The one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking Ladd and Spano and their earlier roles. But great isnt anywhere to be found anywhere here - story performances and particularly the absurd courtroom hi-jinks. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr passed the 300-lb. mark) and Ben Matlock are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom instead of being boringly confined to a lectern. And Matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of or shown them. No real-life judge or prosecutor would stand for this.<br /><br />Both Perry and Ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer. Actually Perry nearly always did this but often Matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit pronounce it reasonable doubt and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party - sometimes on-camera sometimes presumed at the end of the show.<br /><br />But that said Holland Taylors histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her in the courtroom portion of this story made the actions of Matlock/Mason more-closely resemble the slow often boring detail such as seen on Court TV and in real-life courtrooms.<br /><br />Every character in this presentation was either insipid unsympathetic obnoxious boring improbable - or some combination of two or more of these.<br /><br />The ending was the most banal absurd even silly conclusion possible - but again fascinating because of this. Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals and t.v. movies would appear their best forte - probably best in 2nd-lead (probably better if 3rd-) roles even in this venue. Taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them. Give this one 1 star for the story/performances and 3 additional for the fascination factor.',neg
'Artistically speaking this is a beautiful movie--the cinematography music and costumes are gorgeous. In fact this movie is prettier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />So as far as the writing goes the dialog was well-written and the story at times was interesting. However the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways--after all its the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. Its interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan the women STILL long for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame though Streets Of Shames characters are a lot less likable and more one-dimensional.<br /><br />So overall it gets a 7--mostly due to everything BUT the writing. Its too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa.',pos
'In its depiction of a miserable Milanese underclass this film was probably quite revealing in its day. However I get the feeling that neorealism was never really director De Sicas bag since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country. After spending most of his childhood in an orphanage Toto ends up living in a shantytown in Milan. He organises the inhabitants into community action and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables. That nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me as these people have far more important things to think about like where the next Pot Noodle is going to come from. Anyway De Sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are. Its all down to capitalism of course and in order to illustrate this he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land. Brilliant! To his credit though by this time he has given up on making a serious film and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures all fur coats and cigars. They want that land but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense. By a bizarre stroke of luck his old deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove. He uses it to shower gifts on his mates who prove just as greedy as the cigar men. I reckon this film was a missed opportunity. To address the theme of poverty  as not many film-makers had done until then and then get caught up in a fairy tale to me seems a bit daft. How come great directors get away with child-like plot turns like the ones we see here? Hans Christian Anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the Milan Duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks. De Sica however is proclaimed as a genius for this. Surely the fact that these people are so poor that their faith is unswerving and that miracles never happen to them is enough for any story-teller to work on.<br /><br />',neg
'To remake Lost Horizon as a musical the need for a Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe type musical composition was needed. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. Having said that my favorite thing about Lost Horizon is its score. Its just that the score doesnt fit the piece. The cast is made-up of mostly non-musical talents (Ullman Finch and Hussey were all dubbed and still dont sound all that great).<br /><br />Frankly the novella on which this and the earlier non-musical film versions were based is mediocre at best. While the possibilities for a truly good cinematic musical version exist they are not realized here. The film succeeds at being a good rainy-day vehicle to pass the time. Otherwise you are better off buying the CD of its soundtrack. Only recommended as a curiosity piece due to the films awful reputation. Ive seen much better; but Ive seen MUCH worse.',neg
'The opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness - the altered version of the Archers logo the introductory disclaimer the way the camera pans over the cosmos. Its strange to think that `Its a Wonderful Life came out in the same year. No great coincidence: the 1940s was awash with heaven-and-earth films; but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered something best passed over in silence when placed next to Alfred Junges vision.<br /><br />It continues to look great all the way through as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us. Im not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general. One of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other. Not so here. Powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if its the most natural thing in the world a mere change of palettes. Both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own.<br /><br />As for the story ... this may be Pressburgers best script or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events. Other than that its tight yet with more going on than I can possibly allude to here. Was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary? (Or both? Perhaps Carter dreamt up a fantasy that was as it so happened true.) Everyone says were meant to neither ask nor answer this question but I dont see why. Im sure we ARE meant to ask the question. The film even gives us clues as to what the answer is - indeed the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions. The fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesnt mean that this shouldnt occupy us as well. There is as Ive said before a lot going on.<br /><br />Consider the scene in which Abraham Farlan (Heavens prosecuting lawyer) plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match and contemptuously says `The voice of England 1945. Dr. Reeves (the defence) acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment and then produces one of his own: a blues song from America which Farlan listens to as though hes got a lemon in his mouth. Reeves looks smug.<br /><br />Snobbery? Well I dont see why its snobbish to condemn blues music - and thats not what Powell and Pressburger are doing anyway. As the song is being played we get a shot of the American soldiers listening to it: several of them nod their heads to the rhythm perfectly at home. THEY dont find it incomprehensible. Theres something valuable about the song and neither Reeves nor Farlan knows what it is. Reeves probably realises as much. All English audiences (and all Australian Indian etc. audiences as well) know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast too; and that while Reeves understands THAT he is unable to explain it to Farlan - hence the blues broadcast which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else. Its a clever scene.<br /><br />One last thing. I found David Niven a bit cold without the charisma he would acquire later in his career; but even so I dont think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began as this one did.',pos
'I saw this 1997 movie because I am a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and of his father the late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion Lorenzo looked his best in this film mostly due to his hairstyle and the preppy wardrobe that were flattering to him.<br /><br />As the plot progressed I realized the movie was more than just entertainment or a reason to see a favorite actor. The story was about a ring of serial killers and the attempts of law enforcement to investigate the ring and bring the members to justice. There was adequate suspense and I believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer.<br /><br />At the end of the film I was shocked to learn the film is the true account of horrendous murders that occurred in Utah. Furthermore Lorenzo and his leading lady were portraying actual FBI agents who solved the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the apprehension of the ring. I believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.',pos
'I happened to catch this on TV and wanted to watch because I remembered the Spin magazine article upon which the movie is based. I was very disappointed. First if James Belushi is the lead actor in a movie it should be a sign that its not exactly an A-list production. Gregory Hines was a world class dancer but sadly not a great actor.<br /><br />In fact all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the director who is this films weakest link. Charles Carner seemed to be trying to ape Oliver Stones JFK in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the real child murderer(s) but without the benefit of a good script an A-list cast or it must be said the talent. It just doesnt work.<br /><br />Its a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment.',neg
'A rich experience is to be gained from watching this film.<br /><br />This is a seemingly simple story of a gifted pupil Yiu Kwok who later becomes a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married with two sons and things at home seem normal. He still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage and his sons alternately fill him with pride (the elder one) and disappointment (the younger one).<br /><br />His passion for the poetry makes him an object of infatuation for a senior student in one of his classes. The student Choi Lam draws pictures of him during class significantly one of him with a flower coming from his mouth. She teases him more with her intelligence than her sexuality although that too is an element. He of course is not immune to her attention though he tries for a while to keep the demarcation line between teacher and student in place.<br /><br />The reason why he doesnt succeed in the end is complicated. Firstly there is a real depth to the communication between him and Choi Lam. It becomes clear that she genuinely likes him and its mutual. Secondly there is a long-standing problem in his marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of both his and his wife becomes ill. The consequences of the wifes involvement with this friend both past and present are almost too sad to bear.<br /><br />Nothing is treated trivially in this film. All the characters have a vivid internal life and an easily discernible history. The two leads Jacky Cheung and Anita Mui are outstanding as are Karena Lam as the student Choi Lam and Shaun Tam as the elder son On Yin.<br /><br />Recommended without reservation.',pos
'Wonderful family film that should be a staple at Christmas time. Its a mystery to me why it isnt. A true lost film that I first encountered flickering away on my old 19 black and white RCA when the Million Dollar Movie was still in vogue on Channel 9 in New York City. This Rudolph Mate directed fantasy should be nestled under everyones Christmas tree. But it has never been released on home video. Too bad. I believe I saw part of it on AMC a few years ago before they cut many of their older films from the rotation. TCM should take up the slack and play it at Easter or on Christmas Eve. Any movie with Santa Aunt Bee the Hostess Cupcake Lady and an actor with the first name King cant be bad. Ann Blyth as Sally is a bundle of energy. During her school years she rushes over to the chapel to pray for St. Ann to help and give guidance to her mixed-up and financially strapped family. It works. So after she graduates she places a statue of St. Ann in her own bedroom. At one point the entire OMoyne residence is moved to another address. I think this was done to put an end to a neighbor dispute between the OMoynes and the dastardly fellow next door. Blyth is cute as a button. Edmund Gwen can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep. All-in-all this is a satisfying movie experience.',pos
'Hey now yours truly TheatreX found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market in almost new condition and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a cult hit so of course it came home with me. <br /><br />What a strange film. The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons cats fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right. Anyway this is one strange pair Big Edie and Little Edie...Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances sings and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. Big Edie (the mother age 79) apparently likes to run around naked and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where were mercifully spared from that. These women talk and talk and talk mostly about the past and it doesnt make a whole lot of sense except to them. They live in absolute filth cats doing their business wherever (Look that cats going to the bathroom behind my portrait!) and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edies voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent lovely you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as eccentric and Id have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for wacked out of their gourds but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them. This is equal parts creepy sad and disgusting but I couldnt stop watching once I started. This is not my normal type of flick but I found it to be somewhat fascinating. It wont be for everybody though guaranteed.',pos
'I really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons -- the subject matter is inherently interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works (e.g. Linda Grants When I lived in modern times)usually from the Israeli side of the fence. Also a bloke I like told me he thought it was the best film hed seen all year so with such a recommendation...<br /><br />HOWEVER I actually found myself nodding off at points! Admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats comfy but I found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters. Once Id got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes I went with it but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film. I liked the concept of a restrained almost silent mise en scene contrasted to these utopian moments - the sexy girl the red balloon and the ninja Muslim fighter. But personally i think the film has been over hyped. Im not saying narrative and plot is everything (its definitely not) but even a little more dialogue would have helped.',neg

'Being a fan of silent films I looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was pretty disappointed. <br /><br />As has been mentioned the film seems to be one long long commercial for the Maxwell automobile. <br /><br />Perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is I may have enjoyed the film more. But it got old very fast. And while I recognize that reality is stretched many times in films without lessening a viewers enjoyment what was with the Mexican bandits? I mean they are chasing a car through the mountains a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour yet they cant catch up to it?',neg
'This film is a classic seventies cop flick that for some reason has been sadly overlooked. It is basically French Connection meets Bullit.<br /><br />Roy Scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives known as the Seven Ups <br /><br />One of their men is discovered during an undercover op and is killed.<br /><br />Scheider and his team must find his killers. They become involved in a battle with the mob.<br /><br />The highlight of the film has to be the car chase obviously included to cash in on the success of Bullit. However this car chase outshines Bullitt due to its length speed and sheer excitement.Its a breathtaking roller-coaster ride that ends rather unexpectedly and spectacularly. Dont miss this little gem !!',pos
'This movie was so bad I thought I was going to scream in the middle of it. It was all I could do to sit through it. The beginning of the movie where they are at war was promising. Only it smacked of Saving Private Ryan to me...or at least an attempt at it. Only we dont care for these people. There was no build up to the characters. The kid that dies I guess was suppose to make us cry...but for some reason it just irritated everyone. Then we have to listen to line after line of sappy dialog that tried desperately to mimic Wuthering Heights which of course was also quoted in the movie. Go figure. There was nothing original about the movie at all it was like sitting through the most mundane parts of every war movie ever made with a little bit of humor thrown in to keep you hoping that it was going to get better. Sadly it doesnt. 3 hours later I leave the theater feeling cheated. Anthony Menghilla should be shot for trying to duplicate the English Patient which for its time was a good movie but now I wonder....should I rent it and make sure I wasnt just caught up in the HYPE??? Maybe I was but I definitely wasnt caught up in the hype of this film. I really went to the theater wanting to like this movie. I am a die hard Nicole Kidman fan. Save your money rent it on DVD and laugh through it as I did.',neg
'This is Not a Love Song.<br /><br />My one word summary of this film would be `Excellent.<br /><br />It probably wont appeal to the mass movie watching public  its a<br /><br />film that forces you to participate. You observe think and question.<br /><br />Comparisons could be made with Deliverance (Topic/Theme) and<br /><br />perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for overall filming style.<br /><br />However this film stands unique against both.<br /><br />The cinematography effects (solarisation freeze frame blur etc)<br /><br />have been seen before but they are used most effectively in this<br /><br />film to underpin the natural tension of the story.<br /><br />Acting is raw menacing and utterly believable.<br /><br />The real theme of the film is about friendship; the title really gives<br /><br />the game away. Its probably not the kind of friendship that most of<br /><br />us have experienced or indeed would want to.<br /><br />It is a love song.',pos
'This is a great horror film for people who dont want all that vomit-retching gore and sensationalism. This movie has equal amounts of horror suspense humor and even a little light nudity but nothing big. Linnea Quigley isnt over the top as she was in Return of the Living Dead where she danced naked on a crypt but she is still essentially the same slutty character. Cathy Podewell is a virginal and chaste character before going on to Dallas and we are also introduced to Amelia [soon Mimi] Kinkadethe sexy and sinister would-be dark matron of the house. As she and Linnea are possessed and take over the house they reanimate the bodies of their dead friends to scare the limits out of the survivors. Ive heard a lot of people compare this movie to The Evil Dead but if anything this movie is a rival to that one the same way Freddie rivaled Jason.This movie series though is far superior to that one !',pos
'Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar. One of Hollywoods handsome leading men. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds himself doing movies like this. I remember him in Tarantula where he wasnt half bad. Unfortunately there is nothing to recommend this film. The monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. The teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. Theres dancing that goes on and on and then there is no attack. There is some idiotic love triangle that no one could care the least about. It isnt even campy or outrageous. Its just no worth anything. Agar might as well have been a post.

'Screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival under the title  Come Undone April 25 26 & 27 2001. The cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling. Even with fall/winter backgrounds for the present and spring summer for the flashbacks there can be some difficulty following the continuity.<br /><br />Whether either lead is gay the actors well-portray the budding relationship in real life terms; from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking. The story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning. But as the end approaches you really care about where these guys will be next summer! You too will want a sequel to find out.',pos

'There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades but its a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen.<br /><br />Zorros Fighting Legion is a bit different from other Zorro films. First off its a Republic serial in 12 chapters. And this time Zorro is not played by a top studio star like Douglas Fairbanks Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas but instead by workman-like actor Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other he does an adequate job helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here; as the title implies he has a fighting legion to call upon.<br /><br />Another big difference is that the setting isnt California. The story here take place in central Mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous Indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic. Something Zorro and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop.<br /><br />Dont get me wrong there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode from corny twang bow sound effects to ludicrous acting. But overall this represents one of the best Republic serials of all time and probably the best Zorro one.<br /><br />The plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering. and theres lots of great action - fans of the Indiana Jones movies will notice MANY bits borrowed from this serial.',pos
'This beautiful story of an elder son coming home and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from is poignant and moving. It shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the Western world with a sense of family that we have lost. The story is beautiful sad and at times funny and comic. It has a feeling of realism that we dont seem to see any longer in our western movies.<br /><br />The acting is unusual in that as the movie progresses it almost gives the impression that it is not acting but a documentary of ordinary people. This is brilliant directing and movie making.<br /><br />Would love to see more movies by this director.',pos
'Consistency is perhaps this movie its biggest problem. The movie starts of as a fast stylish and just plain fun political satire but in its second halve the movie gets more serious of tone in an almost Oliver Stone kind of way. Its of course also a very serious subject but I would say that the movie would had been way better and also more effective if it had been completely done in the same style as the first halve of the movie got shot in.<br /><br />For a biography and a movie concerning the subject of this movie the movie is also quite short with its mere 102 minutes of running time. The movie because of this feels like it isnt telling the whole story. Of course the following up of the events after the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan gets hinted at in the movie but the movie doesnt go deeper into it and it doesnt explain much about it which feels like a cheap way to just glorify Charlie Wilson without showing the other side of the medal. Also the actual events in the movie itself gets rather simplified even though the story still gets told (needlessly) complex at times.<br /><br />Yes the movie would just had been way better if it was not trying to be so serious at times and overall more light with its style and atmosphere. The movie should had been for instance more like Wag the Dog that achieved to find a right combination of satire and sensitive political issues.<br /><br />Because of this incoherent style and way of storytelling the acting performances are also mixed. When Tom Hanks is playing his character more playfully and in a more comical kind of way hes just excellent. But this just makes it sort of hard to take his character serious in the more serious and sensitive/shocking moments of the movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent though as he is in any movie that he plays in. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. Most of the other actors just seem to walk around in this movie just to be in the movie. This goes mostly for Julia Roberts whose character I found just too mysterious to seem to have a clear enough purpose for the movie. She made a redundant impression on me and is therefor also really forgettable in this movie.<br /><br />Its not that the movie is a bad watch it actually is quite good and also enjoyable but if the movie would had dared to be a bit more edgier the movie would had been a better and foremost also more effective one at what it tried to obviously achieve.<br /><br />7/10',pos

Plot? What plot? Bad guy (well head bad guy) and his henchmen including his earthly agent called Krog (listen carefully or youll suspect its a spoof on the name of McDonalds founder Ray Kroc)and his unbelievably inept gunsels (who however have handguns that never need reloading; as does Commando Cody so there are numerous firefight standoffs).<br /><br />Enjoy.',neg

'I did not really want to watch this one. It seemed to be an old Raj Kanwar movie which disgusted me even before I started watching it because I dont consider him even close to being mediocre as a filmmaker. The only reason I took this one is obviously the Shahrukh Khan appearance in the film. I had not even known what the film was all about because I was sure it would be just an ordinary fairy tale. So I just imagined a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharti with a substantial supporting role by Rishi Kapoor who I thought would be playing her father or uncle. And to my complete shock Rishi Kapoor is actually the hero! He is the one who romances the young Divya! I was saddened to find out that Shahrukh had a small part of no substance and that too only in the second part of this idiotic film.<br /><br />Just let me repeat the question: why would a 17 year-old lovely Divya have fallen for a 40-plus long haired chubby swollen piglet like Rishi Kapoor? Rishi Kapoor should be ashamed of taking this part; the only thing he did is ridiculing himself. He romanced a girl who could logically be younger than his own daughter and to make things worse -- acts like a teenager at his forties. On top of that just to make himself more pathetic he plays a pop-star...<br /><br />To make things clear I have no problems with actors romancing ladies much younger than they themselves are. As long as they make a convincing couple there should be no problem. In fact leading actors have always been cast opposite young girls (Amitabh Bachchan-Sridevi Mithun Chakraborty-Madhuri Dixit Shahrukh Khan-Deepika Salman Khan-Sneha Ullal) and made the pairing pretty well. Also I have nothing against Rishi Kapoor I think he is a good actor and his act in Bobby is still well-engraved in my heart but its not that he looks in this film like say Shahrukh Khan Salman Khan or Aamir Khan look today.<br /><br />That was such a disappointment. Oh and as for the reason every person actually watched this film Shahrukh Khan made a good debut. He excelled in the very little his part allowed him to do. The late Divya Bharti made a promising debut as well. If you want to watch this film go for the second half only. Personally I would not do even that.',neg
'As a helpful warning for others I believe Skeleton Man is actually worse than Raptor Island. I have been using RI as an example of the worst original movie presented on the Sci-Fi channel but SM is the most laughably incoherent and wretchedly designed movie I have yet seen. Yes I did watch almost the whole thing coming into it about 35 minutes into it. It drew me in with its pure ineptitude. What was Sci-Fi thinking? Once Skeleton Man and the surviving platoon leader (or whatever he was--Im not good on military unit terminology) reached the chemical plant the movie moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost mesmerizing. I had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had someone been edited together to make one terrible whole.',neg
'Having first achieved fame with Drunken Master Jackie Chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983s Project A a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re-established him as a major star. By the time Police Story was released two years later the extraordinary hype surrounding Jackie was reaching its zenith and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy. It broke numerous box-office records and inspired a 50\% rise in police recruits but viewed 20 years on - is it any good?<br /><br />As an action movie Police Story unquestionably stands up. There are several terrific fight scenes some stuntwork that recalls the very best of Chans hero Buster Keaton and a compelling if over-violent climactic tussle. Jackies performance is also very strong and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the films impact just a little his charisma carries it through. Furthermore in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger Jackie took a momentous gamble ... though in the event nobody seems to have noticed! By praising Police Story as a simple Good vs. Evil battle critics belittled the films ambiguity of tone and whilst its hardly The Brothers Karamazov in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas.<br /><br />In short this remains a quality popcorn movie* (though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the films final scene) - a potent boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period.',pos
'This splendidly-directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed Tarzan series put out by MGM. It is a first-class adventure for many reasons I suggest--fine photography strong imaginative qualities a delightful cast good simulated-jungle locales and a very exciting storyline. Johnny Weissmuller plays Tarzan a mono-syllabic untutored sort unlike Edgar Rice Burroughs creation; but he is honest loyal brave and very courageous and he needs to be during this narrative. As Jane Parker his wife who had been Jane Porter in the novels Maureen OSullivan is very attractive and lively as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality. The effect of the lighting the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual. This is an outdoor adventure filmed on the MGM back-lot which really works. The fabulous Mutir Escarpment is a remote locale which allows Tarzan and Jane to live undisturbed; but into their idyll come people searching from them emissaries of a civilization Jane has left behind and into which Tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated. One is Harry Holt still in love with her who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him; the gown and perfumes interest her but she refuses to leave Tarzan. Tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals in scenes that look like a humanized King King. The group claim to want to hunt animals and Tarzan agrees for Janes sake to a bit of big game trapping; but at some point the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expeditions heads minds. Tarzan is shot left for dead; and the group force Jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous elephants graveyard. But they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions. Tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call; in a most spectacular elephant-filled scene he saves Jane and what is left of the expedition who return home little richer but much wise as Jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband. The film was directed by set-design wizard Cedric Gibbons and quite beautifully too. His work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting filmwhich manages to seem real despite all its Hollywood shortcomings from start to finish. Neil Hamilton is a very good Harry Paul Cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad. Forrester Harvey and Nathan Curry round out a small cast very professionally. An unusual and well-realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well. Recommended.',pos
'This brief review contains no spoilers since the movie spoils itself. It is wooden and pedantic. It has no saving grace whatsoever. If someone invites you to his house to watch Mr. Imperium dont go. Even the title of the movie is dreadful and portends what garbage lies within. The whole plot is so bad that it could drive Mother Theresa to despair!!! It wasnt a stroke that led to the early demise of poor Ezio it was having to act in this clunker that did him in. It must have haunted him the rest of his days. Perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge upon the Americans for his confinement. He found a perfect vehicle for his wrath in this travesty.',neg
'It seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip Basic Instinct 2 to the point that a significant part of the audience (including critics) found it terrible even before it was released. It seems even more fashionable to trash Sharon Stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful. First comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see for myself. In my opinion this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film but is not as bad as most comments pretend. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. Basic Instinct 2 is just an entertaining average thriller and besides the addition of Jerry Goldsmith original score keeps little resemblance to its predecessor. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension creating a lustful devilish Catherine Trimell who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure. Unfortunately she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick. She became too successful too much of a main icon and like all those actors who have reached that level her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood audiences.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is outstanding giving performances that are far better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is flawless giving a dense complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character. Since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie he can keep your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />I am not recommending Basic Instinct 2 as a great movie; I am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators.',pos
'I really liked the first part of this film in Africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty by civilized humans in Scotland got to me in the second half and made me so sad I couldnt watch some of it. However this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early natural scientists ruined everything alive they didnt understand by studying it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied which we know now shouldnt be studied anywhere but in the natural world they inhabit and as unobtrusively as possible. I do recommend this film as it was a mostly serious and honest story of Tarzan and made a point of showing the gross animal cruelty that was rampant in the 19th century scientific world as well as the pure and simple beautifully primitive life Tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimps after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle.<br /><br />Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life of Tarzan role as was Ralph Richardson in his last film role as Tarzans ultra-rich nobility-reeking gramps in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was pretty and pretty good as Tarzans gussied-up and civilized Jane in her first movie role. From his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes I cannot understand why Lambert did not later become a big star but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in. The terrific Ian Holm as a wounded Frenchman in Africa helped by Tarzan and who then escorted Tarzan back to his previously unknown ancestral home in Scotland was great as always.<br /><br />I am so glad Tarzan got sick of and didnt stay in the animal-cruel civilized world at that time and went home to Africa in the end to live out his life with his gentle and loving ape relatives who raised him instead of staying in Scotland and living like royalty which would have ruined him if it didnt kill him first.',pos
'<br /><br />The movie starts out as an ordinary comic-hero-movie. It´s about the boy who is picked on has no parents and is madly in love with the schools #1 girl. Nothing surprises in the movie there is nothing that you can´t guess coming in the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one. Maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest. You can´t get away from thinking of movies like X-men Batman and Spawn. All of those titles are better. I almost walked out the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation BUT not even that is anything to put in the christmas-tree! So my recomendation: Don´t see this film even if you get paid for it!',neg
'A small-town schoolteacher (Geena Davis) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be a secret government assassin!

Just dont expect to have to think too much about it because then if you take it too seriously then the movie actually wont be fun but stupid instead.<br /><br />This movie doesnt deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name.',pos
'About one step above an Olsens twins film theres a nary a surprise in store here except for how repulsive the bloated hunchbacked Depardieu looks walking around the beach without a shirt on. This guy was supposed to be some sort of heartthrob? Quasimodo hubba hubba? Well whatever.<br /><br />Katherine Heigls a great actress whose career over the last several years has displayed a lot of her potential as both a comedic and dramatic actress but this movie definitely didnt do anything to offer her a break-out role. Her vapid character lacks any trace of personality or self-esteem spending her entire vacation crushing on a cute boy that she thinks is the greatest guy in then world (basically because hes a cute boy) yet she cant be honest with him for two seconds. Ladies let me tell you something; if a guys really into you hes not going to stomp off in a huff because you tried to pass your dad off as your boyfriend. He may be a little confused about why youd do something so silly contrived and um...incestuous but in the end its just going to be something youll laugh together about.<br /><br />The plot and dialogue hits every clche right on cue. No originality and no wit...but its rilly rilly SWEET and Bens rilly rilly cute so viewers who think Titanic is the greatest movie ever made will of course say this movie is great because they wont notice that it doesnt have a brain in its head.

'I honestly found Wicked Little Things to be a very cool and fun horror film.My friend had given this to me and I really saw it as nothing but a crappy low class gory horror film.Then after I watched this I was wrong it was very cool and very good and while Ill say it seemed a bit unnecessary at times and while it may not be the best horror film ever its still good.I thought the acting was very good especially from the girl who plays the mother(she seemed very believable and to me very likable).And while it is a little clichée and over the top its good.Overall I gotta say if the Afterdark Horror Fest films are not your style then you should have no business watching this but if you like horror films or a wicked little time than check out Wicked Little Things. 8.0 out of 10 stars',pos
'Americans Next Top Model is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well I did blink) It can be sad funny or addicting.(mostly addicting)Americas Next Top Model kept me wanting more and thats pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes its on MTV other times its not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series! Its great for pretty much all ages so every can enjoy it! :)<br /><br />Also if you watched the show before havent you noticed that Tyra has a different hair style each time in the judging room?

'SPOILERS<br /><br />*<br /><br />*<br /><br />*<br /><br />*<br /><br />This is Tenchi?<br /><br />This is not Tenchi.<br /><br />Practically everyone is written horribly out of character ... When it comes to characterization the only bright spot is the friendship between Ayeka and Ryoko.<br /><br />Also the villainess is not punished for her actions which amount to mind-control rape. If a male villain had done to one of the women what Haruna does to Tenchi then he would have (rightfully so) painfully bought it at the end of the movie dying horribly and the audience would have cheered. But not only does Haruna pay no price for her crimes Ryoko actually FORGIVES and UNDERSTANDS her actions. No! The real Ryoko would have disintegrated her for what Haruna had done to her beloved Tenchi; the audience I saw this with myself included all booed audibly at this scene<br /><br />Anime fans avoid this movie. Tenchi fans avoid this movie even harder.',neg
'Love Life explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject matter compelling even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. For example Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage Joes glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene. In the end I found myself more turned-on by this movie than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with pornstar skill and exuberance and all-too-often acting chops to match. Many times the movie seems like it is going to go full-on porn. Stephanie Kirchen does a fine job but her moment of enlightenment at the end was sullied a bit for me since I was in the mood for a good romp in the shower by the end of this movie.',neg
'Flat ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves in order to boost her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracey married to the doting Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andys named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) turns up as the resident surgeon trouble is not far behind him.<br /><br />Script fails in that it does not carefully develop the promising premise into an effective tantalising thriller and the severe lack of character motivation background and development leaves the whole show reaching. None of the cast are able to generate interest in their shallow characters especially Bill Pullman whose own inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe.<br /><br />Poor director Harold Becker is left trying to resurrect an impossibly dead project and is unable to make entertainment from any of it. By the time the secret of the plot is revealed you just wont care.<br /><br />At least the cinematography has Massachusetts looking good. Also stars George C. Scott Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer.<br /><br />Sunday February 25 1996 - T.V.',neg
'Get this film if at all possible. You will find a really good performance by Barbara Bach beautiful cinematography of a stately (and incredibly clean) but creepy old house and an unexpected virtuoso performance by  The Unseen. I picked up a used copy of this film because I was interested in seeing more of Bach whom Id just viewed in The Spy Who Loved Me. I love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little. So: we start with a nice fresh premise. TV reporter Bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a California town Solvang that celebrates its Swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival. She brings along a camerawoman who happens to be her sister and another associate. (The late Karen Lamm plays Bachs sister and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to it is just too funny watching Bach (Mrs. Ringo Starr) and Lamm (Mrs. Dennis Wilson) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel.)) Anyway  Bachs disgruntled beau follows her to Solvang as hes not done arguing with her. Theres a lot of feeling still between them but she doesnt wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career. The ladies arrive in Solvang to do the assignment for their station only to find their reservations were given away to someone else. (Maybe to Bachs boyfriend because think of it  wheres he gonna stay?). The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go. Mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum they catch the interest of proprietor Mr. Keller (the late Sidney Lassick) who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home insisting his wife will be happy to receive them. Oh no! Next thing we know Keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife warning her that companys coming and threatening that shed better play along. Trouble in paradise! The ladies are eager to settle in and get back to Solvang to shoot footage and interview Swedes but one of the girls doesnt feel good. Bach and Lamm leave her behind wondering to themselves about Mrs. Keller (played heartbreakingly by pretty Lelia Goldoni) who looks like she just lost her best pal. Speaking of which  under-the-weather Vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub not realizing that Keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole. She hears him thinks hes come to deliver linen and calls out her thanks. Lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didnt get a long enough look. After hes left poor Vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast (in a really decent frightening round of action) by something BIG that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor  The Unseen! Lamm comes home next (Bach is out finishing an argument with her beau) and cant find anyone in the house. She knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen and on hands and knees to collect it her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille  attracting The Unseen again! Well at about the time poor Lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen we do a flashback into Mr. Kellers past and get the full story of what his sick sadistic background really is and why his wife doesnt smile much. Bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are. Meanwhile Lassick has been apprised of the afternoons carnage by his weeping wife and decides he cant let Bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home. He tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the Keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us.<br /><br />I cannot say enough for Stephen Furst whom Id never seen before; its obvious that he did his homework for this role studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged; Bach and Goldoni each in their diverse way just give the movie luster. Not only that but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution. No stupid cheap tricks eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners... A real treat for your collection.',pos
'This movie is just like every other dutch movie so if you enjoy movies such as turks fruit and de kleine blonde dood. then you might be okay with this one (even though those two have much better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts strong enough but even that one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline. Theres a lot of nudity (but me and others just could not find that girl attractive) the dialog is laughable (as we did a lot to the annoyance of other movie watchers) and some of the scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else (like a random scene in which an owl rips somebodys eye out...it has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once later in a sentence saying did you hear what happened...I was there). the only reason I gave it a 2 is because some of the places they are at look nice...thats it. And the reason I saw it was because we went to the sneak preview (here in Holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews you pay less money then for a regular movie and you dont know what movie it is that you will be watching. All you know is that its a new movie thats not yet in the theaters). My advice is to stay far away from this film if you really want to see a good dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek.',neg
'The title of this movie doesnt make a lot of sense until you see it in operation because its the sound that a retarded young man makes while hes operating his imaginary trolley which is what he does all day. And he is just one of many odd characters in this surreal & at times tragic tale of a group of slum-dwellers in Japan.<br /><br />There are two drunks who trade wives theres a man with aspirations to be a architect and his young son who he sends out to beg for food. Theres a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of sanity within all that goes on around him and theres a businessman with some severe nervous tics that has a wife that treats him (and everyone else) like dirt.<br /><br />Theres no particular plot to this really its a bunch of stories that drift back & forth between each other sometimes funny sometimes tragic. All in all I thought it worked pretty well & I had been dying to see this for a long time just based on its description. I was not in the least disappointed and Id definitely recommend this. 9 out of 10.',pos
'I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before I took it back to the store. Bill Paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both deliver good performances. The story is told in an interesting manner with both flashbacks 20 years back then spots in the present alternating back and forth. This style of storytelling makes for a good thriller that cant get dull. Bill Paxton please make more horror movies you have the talent for it!',pos
'This is the kind of picture John Lassiter would be making today if it werent for advances in CGI.

'A bit the movie in the movie case or as the theme is virtual game here which is the reality or even more frightening which reality is the real one.As any Cronenberg there are organic things like the pod and that wonderful idea:the organic gun a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoots teeth.

'I decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on IMDb it is cited that John Woo a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre-American years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest made in US films plans to remake it. Well here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever: The plot of the film is simple and even clichéd by todays standards but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads unique direction by Mellville cinematography music and its style. There is no way any director today can make such film it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in todays Box-office targeted movie business. <br /><br />John Woo did make a more or less decent film which borrowed from Melvilles Le Samourai - The Killer but remember it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive (in salaries) but cheap (in acting merits) actors. So what Im saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made together with another film by Melville - Le Samourai. Watch it. And even if the remake will be made try to avoid it before seeing the great original first.',pos
'I have to admit that in spite of all media promotion and being nominee for Oscar my expectation from the film was not so high before watching it. And I really found what I expected; a film trying to be likable for both for conservatives and liberals in Turkey trying being authentic for foreign spectators and enough funny for all. But it should be understood that it is not possible to be favorable for everybody therefore film stays as average for all.<br /><br />Whole movie is telling a story occurred within 24 hours. To fit the short story in a full movie length some scenes are added without a connection with the main story. These are mostly the ice-cream selling scenes to the eccentric local people (i.e. goat herdsman old women etc.) and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the spectators by skits with comic dialogs. The subject is mentioned as a universal problem: Struggle of a local producer-tradesman against holding companies and monopoly but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before. Most of the readers will remember the Hero grocer against supermarket from Ferhan Sensoy in 1980s. This was the correct story at correct time. Shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now.<br /><br />Except some gibbers due to local accent the performance of cast is so successful. The leading role is played by Turan Ozdemir with excessive body language but anyway he is successful too.<br /><br />On the other hand against limited budget appreciable efforts of director and players are obviously giving a good mood to the film. But this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with Italian neo-realists or worth to be Oscar nominee.<br /><br />Note: In the real life normally the Ice-cream seller would stop his own production and be the dealer of one of the competitors of Manda brand.',neg
'I just finished watching guinea pig - Devils experiment. I have to say that this movie although having very good FX better then I expected was NOT a good movie. I honestly cant say that I enjoyed this movie at all. Of course It is effective in its way of being a shocking realistic twisted 43 minutes of torture but I found it to be very boring (and not as gory as i hoped). And also I found that the torturers were very annoying when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time that ruined it even more (and Im sure theres some people out there who will agree with me on that one). I have now seen guinea pig 1235 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of the flesh and blood. I wont say much more about Devils experiment other than Great fx descent acting from the girl annoying fu**ing torturers overall I give it 4 stars on account of the FX cos they are awesome.',neg
'Ugly shot poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to Joe Dantes 1981 classic. The Howling is one of the two or three ONLY good werewolf-films ever made and yet it got rewarded by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one. If its any consolation Stirba is a sequel in name only and theres absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in Dantes film. The plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of Transsylvanian werewolves  primarily female ones  led by Stirba. Stirba is played by Sybil Danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond super-babe (with impressive bosom) in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused. Her arch-enemy is played by a seemly fatigue Christopher Lee. His character  Stefan Crosscoe  is an occult investigator who travels to Stirbas kingdom accompanied by an American couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult. In case youre exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity...this is your film. Even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and were even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence. However if you want a little substance or depth youll be sorely disappointed. The dialogues are embarrassing and theres absolutely no tension to detect anywhere. The scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires (the Transsylvanian setting garlic wooden stakes...) and Dannings gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the films only gimmick. During the end-credits a shot in which she rips off her top is re-edited repeatedly (according to my fellow reviewer Dr. Gore no less than seventeen times!) which is pretty pathetic and pointless. The music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful. Im talking about the fierce-looking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of Stirbas castle. The directing by Philippe Mora is a giant mess and  as far as Im concerned  his only worthwhile film remains The Beast Within released three years earlier.',neg
'Just watched it then. It is pretty damn awesome. The fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool! Its totally like a video-game in parts with some amazing hand-to-hand combat in there.<br /><br />This film is for the fans: To those who loved this world once before and spent time with its friends gather again and devote your time... Besides this ominous opening the story was not very hard to follow and Ihave never played a Final Fantasy game. I think it pays to be familiar with Role Playing Games in general; knowledge of the genre kinda helps you grasp some of it better. I think though that if you pay attention and accept what the film throws at you its quite easy to understand. There is a lot that isnt explicitly explained and if you demand that it should be then you will probably be confused and irritated.<br /><br />Watching the film is like being dropped into the middle of some grand saga and having to put as much of the puzzle together as possible. I like that approach; you get caught up in the mystery and confusion that all the characters are going through. But like I said just be accepting. If a weird red lion thing that talks turns up and starts kicking ass and taking names and the other characters just say hes an old friend accept it and move on; you dont need a biopic flashback or a tell-all sit-me-down. You are an observer here of something beyond your experience and undestanding.<br /><br />So: fantastic graphics and animation great voice acting cool video game styled music involving story and characters and maybe some of the coolest fights youll see in a while. Its worth seeing and while it IS for the fans it is perfectly accessible for people like me that have never played the games.',pos
'One of the best musicals ever made this is an example of where the producers and director were not afraid to pick actors for their talent rather than for what people might expect. The lighting and set are unique giving it a very interesting effect (this has a special name that I cannot think of). The dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used. The movie is well paced beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish. A real joy is the MUSIC. Such an array of first-rate songs from beginning to end that are perfectly performed and orchestrated. Also the music is very original and very memorable and I think superior to many musicals from the thirties through the sixties. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals that might have only two or three. Not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie. Another quality is that it is fresh each time one sees it.',pos
'I must have seen a different version than the first person on the user comments section.<br /><br />Its really really good...Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are great together. Val Kilmers character is much like he was in the novel although the emphasis is on Gus and Call and the Comanches. We get to see what happened with Call and Newts mother as well. I wont spoil it but it gives a lot of insight into Calls character.<br /><br />All the actors did a really convincing job. Steve Zahn had the biggest challenge I thought to follow Robert Duvall! Theres a lot of action humor tragedy. Its got something for everyone. I cant wait until it airs my family are all jealous I got to see it early!',pos

'Michael Caton-Joness Scottish period piece bears little connection to the Sir Walter Scott novel of the same name...<br /><br />The film opens in the Scottish highlands with Robert Roy McGregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of His Lordship James Grahams cattle... The scene then switches to a sword-fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs adorned shirts soft colored coats paleface make-up and conventional gestures...<br /><br />MacGregor lives under the protection of a local lord named Marquis of Montrose... When he enters an ill-advised trade agreement with Montrose he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of Montroses evil-doers... The unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape... When Rob Roy is finally compelled to rebel against the English soldiers the action becomes well understood ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade...<br /><br />Liam Neeson injects heroism and passion to his character... He is intelligent fair and virile... He carries his height with grace as the Scottish chieftain of a small community... He is a loving father a passionate lover and a noble husband driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains... Hed rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust... <br /><br />Oscar winner Jessica Lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife a proud peasant woman brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat... Langes lines are filled with dignity and integrity: I will think on you dead until my husband makes you so. And then I will think on you no more.<br /><br />John Hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make Montrose something more than a greedy Marquis ruthless with money and tempered by the English courts fashion for foppery... He is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service... Honor in his view seems a quaint notion... He has two objectives: ruin the reputation of his rival the Duke of Argyle and to hunt down the fugitive MacGregor... He sends his soldiers to burn the Highlanders homes to kill their people and their livestock...<br /><br />Tim Roththe perfect antithesis to the hero is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer... He is a penniless British aristocrat a nasty hired sword wonderfully evil ravishing and murdering his way through the Scottish mist... His name is Archibald Cunningham... He turns out to be a liar a thief and a murderer... He dismisses himself as but a bastard abroad seeking his fortune and the favors of great men and therefore cant care about anyone else: Love is a dung hill and I am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow. He even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl...<br /><br />Cunningham seems pathetic... He smiles foolishly and utters words with affected refinement but not terribly harmful-until a muscular swordsman insults him and we discover that hes a cool head and an expert with a sword... He really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination...<br /><br />And while Brian Cox is suitably odious as Killearn Andrew Keir is Montroses rival the powerful local aristocrat the Duke of Argyll one of the few trustworthy men McGregor meets outside his own family... <br /><br />Set in 18th-century Scotland and with an atmospheric musical score Rob Roy is really a love story between a man and his wife a recognizably human story unjustly dwarfed by Mel Gibsons Braveheart that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing English landlords...',pos

'I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. Not as salacious as it sounds this is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes) featuring Slovenian superstar philosopher/psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring themes of sexuality fantasy morality and mortality. It was directed by Sophie Fiennes of the multi-talented Fiennes clan (shes sister to actors Ralph and Joseph).<br /><br />I enjoyed this quite a bit although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested. Freudian and Lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours. It didnt help that an ill-advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so.<br /><br />My only real issue with this is that Zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with Freudian themes. He spends quite a bit of time on the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch not exactly masters of subtlety. I would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films although thats really just me saying Id like to see part four and five and six.<br /><br />Zizek is very funny and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films hes discussing. So for instance we see him in a motorboat on his way to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcocks The Birds) or sitting in the basement of the Bates Motel (from Psycho). Which is not to say that his theories are not provocative. Even when I found myself disagreeing with him it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films. Which is exactly what hes trying to accomplish.',pos
'So many people loved this movie yet there are a few of us IMDb reviewers who found Mirrormask excruciatingly uncomfortable to watch and arse-clenchingly boring. I fall into the latter of these two camps and I will try to explain what it was that made my toenails curl so unpleasantly.<br /><br />Firstly to set the record straight - I like Neil Gaimans books. I sometimes find his knowing sarcastic wry asides humour a little geeky and I actually prefer his work when he is playing it straight and leaving the jokes alone - but even with his occasional lapses into crap dad gags I find his creativity and imagination to be something a bit special.<br /><br />Interestingly one of Gaimans strongest works is Coraline a Gothic fairy story for kids that is very low on jokes and high on tension and creepiness. His latest novel (Anansi Boys) overdoes the funnies and tends to read at times like Terry Pratchett does the Sisters of Mercy (not the nuns but the band). Mirrormask inhabits similar territory to Coraline and when I saw the stunning visuals in the trailer I got a bit excited that somebody had managed to transfer Gaimans spectacular vision and imagination to the screen.<br /><br />In praise of the film some sequences do look stunning. However the visual effects are occasionally ruined by CGI animation that looks like a Media Studies student project. Backgrounds and scenery are often incredible but some of the character animation looks clumsy amateur and cheap. In an early dream sequence the spider is animated beautifully but the book-eating cat-beast looks poorly rendered and very computer generated. Compared with the standard of animation found in productions such as The Corpse Bride Mirrormask occasionally looks very amateur indeed. However in Mirrormasks defence the budget was tiny for such a grand vision and a few creaks in the effects can be understood and forgiven.<br /><br />What cannot be forgiven is the stilted stagy cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. The actors struggle desperately with the dialogue - and there is so much of it that they are constantly hampered and stumbling over it. Conversation is rendered completely unnatural the jokes fall flat time and time again and the turgid speeches appear to be the writers only method of plot exposition. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which always adds an element of Phantom Menace) - this renders the film almost unwatchable. In such an unreal setting the actors need to work twice as hard to be believed and in the main they fail terribly. The girl who plays the lead role puts in a valiant struggle against the impossible stage-school dialogue and occasionally shows real promise but it is never enough. The god-awful cod-Oirish of the Valentine character (with whom she is forced to spend an inordinate amount of screen time) puts paid to any chance of this young actress rising above the material. It appears to be Valentines job to explain the plot to younger viewers and to add a bit of light relief. Personally I wouldnt want him anywhere near my 15 year old daughter.<br /><br />What else is wrong with this film? Answer....Rob Brydon. Whats annoying (for us Brits anyway) is we know Rob Brydon can act! Weve seen him hold the screen for half-an-hour on his own (doing those Marion & Geoff monologues) and in the first real world bit of the film he is fine. However stick him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and turns into the worst am-dram-ham Ive seen in years. A real shame.<br /><br />What else is wrong? Answer... the wanky slap-bassing sub-Courtney Pine saxing and unlistenable too-high-in-the-mix soundtrack that never shuts up. God the music is incessant loud distracting irrelevant and if that isnt enough has wanky slap bass wanking all over it. It makes the dialogue very hard to hear but that could be a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />What else is wrong with it? Answer.... The whistling mime artist. In modern society there should be no place for mime apart from certain secret places in France. Every moment the camera lingers on the gurning whistling moss-juggling yogurt-weaving idiot I understand why the Edinburgh locals get a bit anxious and fractious when Festival time comes round again.<br /><br />My final criticism is that the film is pretty dull. Surrealism often is dull  it either requires its audience to slip into a dreamlike Zen accepting state or for the audience be constantly wowed by bigger and grander surprises. A story with a bit of pace involving characters that we could believe in and care about would have gone a long way to giving this film the emotional centre that it sadly lacked whilst stopping the eyelids from drooping.<br /><br />Finally apologies to all those who found depth meaning and wonder in this film. You have managed to suspend your disbelief you have seen past the creaky CGI ignored the crappy dialogue and the abysmal performances that resulted and understood the makers grand imaginative vision. I wanted to but I couldnt see past the real-world failings that dragged it down.<br /><br />I hope Neil Gaiman gets it right next time if he gets (or even wants) the opportunity.',neg
'First off lets start with the negative points: 1) There are HUGE gaping wholes in the story line and questions that are raised that will get no where near being answered; 2) The movie is not for all people so impolite viewers will get restless and start yapping during the movie.<br /><br />Point two above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older type theater (like the one I went to) you can hear the reel going through the projector at times. I loved that. The movie does not keep you busy with music nor effects: it lets you reflect upon what is happening.<br /><br />There is a lack of rhythm that generates an atmosphere that is fascinating an utterly enjoyable. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it to fans of cinema as the cinematographic work is amazing. Those that base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed. Its the kind of story that you have to make up the links in your mind afterwards. (My version of it is pretty darn cool but probably quite off-track!) If you do go catch the movie there is one very cool part: when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Hats off to the person that thought of doing this.',pos

One generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone gets to sum up his life and personality in this line -I AM a CHICKEN-TWIT! (this was the USA network version) My old man was right! No wonder he left us... Boo-hoo.<br /><br />(Not actually a spoiler ) Bad guy (on fire) screams Aargh! Fire!',neg
'I looked forward to watching this film and then realised that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was swamped by the unnecessary swearing. Now I am not a prude in any way but to shout obscenities at each other does not a good film make. Ewan Bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time (witness his performance in the god awful Life of Stuff) & his Cockney accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many more of these films Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Beautiful Creatures do we have to suffer before the film makers realise that the f-word the c- word etc does not replace proper dialogue.',neg

'Being a history buff I rented this movie because of the subject matter. The idea of the Ellis Island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one small group is intriguing. Unfortunately the movie falls flat. Much of the story is simply boring; nothing much happens for long stretches. The director uses goofy imagery (offered up in the form of daydream sequences) in an apparent attempt to break up the glacial pacing but instead it clashes with the authentic look and feel of the movie. The characters are also poorly drawn. In the end we dont really care as much about them as we should. Its a shame that this wasnt what it could have been. I would still like to see a good movie about the American immigrant experience but this one isnt it.',neg

The background scenery is beautiful.<br /><br />I think the film does a good job of portraying Joseph Smith both as a man and as a prophet. Josephs spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend watching this movie.',pos
'This movie didnt really surprise me as such it just got better and better. I thought: Paul Rieser wrote this huh? Well...well see how he does... Then I saw Peter Falk was in it.

They played off of each other so well that I practically felt giddy with enjoyment! ...And I hadnt even been drinking!<br /><br />This movie was so well done that I wanted to get right on the phone to Paul and let him know how much I enjoyed it! but I couldnt find his number. Must be unlisted or something.<br /><br />This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything. It just came on and I thought:Eh why not?

'So American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series. Although it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (cant that guy get better gigs?).<br /><br />There is very little to compliment this movie on. There arent any funny jokes. The acting is painful to watch especially the girl with the southern accent which sounds more like a Canadians impersonation of a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word yall. This movie makes me feel like such an idiot. Why didnt I apply to a college where nobody goes to class (but everybody gets good grades) girls consistently take their clothes off in public everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs and you can ejaculate all over a girls family photos without her minding? Really this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn. Maybe for the next one theyll finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as the lead. Im sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character Stiflers 3rd uncle once removed or something like that.',neg
'Homecoming; what a HUGE disappointment!! After reading the plot summary (the dead coming back to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush!!!!!) I couldnt wait to see this. It started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately though it slowly descended into a boring political satire that I didnt need to see (I can just watch some good old Aussie comedy for that!). There was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they werent even that scary.

'This movie is something horrible. I was laughing all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought its not polite to laugh when people are dying but in this movie even death looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into one tornado.<br /><br />Explosions of cars thrown onto buildings by the forces of wind look like ones from the old school side scroller game called R-Type. Dialogues are very bad and I am interested how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie. It is simply amazing how such bad movie can make it into the TV.<br /><br />Only real reason to watch this movie is to have some fun of nonsense and absurdity.',neg
'I understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent I have sat through many movies that dont particularly hold my interest but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children. Parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their childrens activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in childrens movies. Disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name.<br /><br />Technically the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over-dubbed and unnatural. Personally I hate that but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project. The acting reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices. Thankfully it was a very short movie.<br /><br />Now before I come off like a video-geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick the one thing that can save even the worst childrens movie is a positive message. Far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is. Let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given: <br /><br />If you are lost dont worry you will inevitably find your way home.<br /><br />Approach wild animals without any fear.<br /><br />You can win any competition just because you know you can.<br /><br />and my favorite the final message left in the film: <br /><br />Its okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right.',neg

'A made for television version of the Heart of Darkness seemed like a good way to add more insight to the book well that was the wrong assumption. The movie made it even worse. I was highly disappointed about almost everything in the movie. I hoped that the movie would possibly help put the pieces of the book together that I didnt comprehend but it did no such thing. It still left me confused and hanging. It is one of those movies that makes one feel like it would be more fun to watch the grass grow instead of watching the movie. Not exactly anyones cup of tea. It was an overall dreadful boring and slow movie.<br /><br />To begin with Nicolas Roeg must have been pretty desperate when he decided that he wanted to undertake the task of making the already boring book into a movie. Its a guaranteed loss. Its like going into a knife fight but forgetting the knife on the kitchen counter. The knifeless person is going to lose; and in the case the knifeless person was Roeg. All Ive heard about the movie are bad things and the movie deserves those bad things to be said about it. From watching the movie I got the impression that the people who made the movie just skimmed over the book to get the key points.<br /><br />Furthermore although the movie did follow the main story line of the book it left out quite a few details and it also changed the ending. I am not a fan of that. Roeg left out when Marlow and his crew came across the Russian sailors camp and at that camp they found the book. Also it didnt show when at the camp they came across the sign that says Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach cautiously (Conrad 110). Also at the end of the book Kurtz dies on the boat not at the inner station.<br /><br />On the contrary Nicolas Roeg did one good thing while he was making his movie; he managed to hire some pretty decent actors to play in the movie. For instance he acquired Tim Roth and John Malkovich both of whom would later go on to have successful careers. In doing so he added a little something to the horrible movie. Also though I am ripping his book to shreds I do have some respect for him because it takes a lot of courage to try to take on The Heart of Darkness. It isnt exactly the easiest novel to portray into a film. Twus a valiant effort though! In conclusion if for whatever reason someone actually wants to watch this movie I suggest the reading of Heart of Darkness first. This way youll get all of the scenes that were left out of the movie and you wont be completely lost when you watch it. But I really suggest you dont read the book and that you really dont watch the movie; both will be a complete waste of your time. Trust me. I was forced to do both by my English teacher and now I wish that the book and the movie didnt exist. If either the book or the movie are pursued good luck!',neg
'Reviewing KAZAAM and saying its a bad movie isnt hard at all--after all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film--saying it was among the worst films of the decade! So the fact that I say its bad or anyone else says its bad is certainly no surprise. Its like someone talking about WWII--practically no one says that was a GOOD thing right?! The question I have and no place on IMDb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place?!. After all its obvious to anyone who isnt severely brain injured that the film would be horrible. But movies like ED (a baseball playing chimp) COOL AS ICE (starring the ever-popular Vanilla Ice) TROLL 2 (which doesnt even have any trolls in it) BABY GENIUSES (Einstain-like superhero babies) and PINOCCHIO IN OUTER SPACE (huh!?!) prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen! So the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright normal! <br /><br />The film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school. Like the punk from FREE WILLY this kid is somehow misunderstood (in other words a total brat) and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is by the end of the film hell have learned something and grown. Just once I want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film! Eventually while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him the genie Kazaam (Shaquille ONeal)is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes. But the kid doesnt believe him AND the genies magic seems a tad rusty.<br /><br />Eventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real. However unlike most kids he withholds making his wishes so in the meantime Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere--like his own personal servant. And according to the cliché you know that by the end of the film Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed. Oh and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and moms fiancé (Im gonna gag). Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes.<br /><br />As for Kazaam Shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap...very poorly. Im a middle-aged white guy and I think I could probably rap at least as well! Hes an amazing basketball player and Ive heard hes a nice guy--but a rapper...no way! As far as his acting goes he wasnt great but had such a nice personality in the film that its hard to hate him--even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things.<br /><br />So is the movie as excruciatingly awful as youve probably heard? through the first two-thirds of the movie I would have said no. Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script. However later in the film the bad becomes horrid--as Kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when hes really needed. And out of nowhere the plot gets really really weird--as the guy who wants to make Kazaam a rap star(?!?!) turns out to be an evil mobster! And oddly this guy seems to accept that Kazaam is a genie with no hesitation! <br /><br />In addition the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his dad. I know that the kid was annoying but this is supposed to be a kids film!! What part of trying to kill the kid didnt the writers not understand?!? Then in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history Kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug-induced hallucination! This ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in THE BLACK HOLE...and boy did it make my brain hurt!! Uggghh--the horrible dialog was just too much to bear!!!<br /><br />Overall its a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane. Yes folks with a messed up message bizarre non-kid friendly material and horrible characters this is one wretched film. Sadly given the idea and actors its hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse!!<br /><br />By the way if you want to see a Genie in a modern world film that is GOOD try the British made for TV film Bernard and the Genie--a charming and exceptionally well-written film from start to finish.',neg
'Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. Im so glad Block forged on after his Mothers death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didnt have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation. I wonder if the therapist ever tried to get her to think about what she could have done to change her situation and free herself? Meanwhile wife #2 was just the opposite. She was out there working with his Dad; ended her bad marriage supported herself and appears to be a very confident giving person. Whatever the state of the marriage the Blocks did something right in raising 3 kids who could look at their parents story be OK with it and share it with us and maybe lead us to start conversations with our parents and spouses.',pos
'Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Much reviled when it first appeared (inspiring the famous review Me No Leica) this precursor of Cabaret can now be looked at in comparison and its not half bad. Its certainly no classic but it has its own wayward charm (the film version of Cabaret follows this plot whereas the stage version changed the plot somewhat). One should of course resist the temptation to snicker when Laurence Harveys Christopher Isherwood (it keeps the original authors real name; God Knows what Isherwood thought of it) describes himself as a confirmed bachelor and while Harvey is an utterly inadequate hero (hes virtually asexual) and Shelly Winters woefully miscast as Fraulien Landauer (the part Marisa Berenson played in Cabaret) Julie Harris is a perfectly marvellous Sally (its a lovely piece of comic acting) and Anton Diffring is first-rate as Fritz the German-Jew in love with Shellys character. Of course if Cabaret had never come along you might ask yourself would this ever have seen the light of day again. That it has been revived may not quite be cause for celebration but its perfectly acceptable all the same.',pos

'As a devotee of Ms. Frank I remember being so excited that the play was being re-made for TV. That is until I saw it... This film is a prime example of how IMPORTANT casting is and how directing plays such an important part in creating the sense of purpose. The casting of any CENTRAL role is CRUCIAL to a production of this sort...shows like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the charisma of the lead actor. And in the cast of this movie the whole thing is destroyed by the atrocious casting of Melissa Gilbert in the lead role. There is not ONE SINGLE MOMENT that Ms. Gilbert even comes close to inhabiting the sensitive mature spirit of Anne- Ms. Gilbert is white-bread throughout the movie... the only time I was close to tears was during the reading of Annes most haunting line: I still believe in spite of everything that people are truly good at heart- this is spoken by Ms. Gilbert so rushed so lacking in conviction that she might has well burped and achieved the same effect. Film and dance legend Marge Champion was the dialogue coach for this production- she should have refunded her salary! Despite Ms. Gilbert ruining DIARY other performances are satisfactory for the most part- special kudos to Joan Plowright as Edith Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell does not have the deep-rooted soul and spirit as Otto as does the creator of the role on stage and film(Joseph Schildkraut) but hes okay. Doris Roberts and James Coco as The Van Danns are relatively superficial in their parts- theyre shrill and bombastic but again only on the surface. This COULD be due to the fact that the pacing of the project is way too rushed(as noted in previous postings)- this film clocks in 45 minutes shorter than the film version- the difference owing to the pauses for dramatic effect which apparently is necessary to propagate the appropriate MOOD for the story. This is NOT mandatory viewing especially for youngsters learning about Anne Frank for the first time- stick to the original film version and or even better the TV production of ANNE FRANK: THE TRUE STORY starring Ben Kingsley which is the CLOSEST thing to capturing the heartbreak and reality of Annes situation ever filmed! Note: Especially appalling is the fact that Melora Marshall who plays Annes sister Margot is NOT included in the opening credits along with all the other members of The Secret Annex... shes listed in the post-credits along with the actors playing Miep and Mr. Kraler. If I was Ms. Marshall I would have SUED!',neg

It jumps around from place to place. It does not stay focused on anything for very long. The ending starts on christmas morning with a hotel fire.

'This movie is a Gem because it moves with soft but firm resolution.<br /><br />I caution viewers that although it is billed as a Corporate Spy thriller and Ms Liu is there it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace. Its NOT about explosions car chases or flying bullets. You must be patient and instead note the details here. Its sedate because thats what the Main Character is. The viewer has to WATCH him and Think as this story unfolds.<br /><br />I will not give spoilers-- because that destroys the point of watching. The plot is what youve read from the other postings: an average white-collar guy seeking change and adventure signs on for a corporate spy job. Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data. <br /><br />Take it from there.<br /><br />This movie starts at a surreal walk-- with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential underlying suburban paranoia.<br /><br />Then it begins to accelerate.<br /><br />The acting on all parts is superb-- and yes some of the acts are caricature characters. But they all fit and they entertain. And the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft soft key sinister theme: All is not right at the beginning.<br /><br />And at the end: All is not what it seems.<br /><br />Get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one-- and turn up the sound: This movie wants you to LISTEN.',pos
'It started out slow after an excellent animated intro as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop. Once the bet is on though the movie picks up the pace as its a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm. We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son: bullies helping others mind over matter when you dont want to do something.<br /><br />Of special note is the girl who played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director kinda sneaks her in unexpectedly and when she is on-screen she is captivating. Shes one of those Hey she looks familiar faces and then I remembered that she was the little girl that Pepsi featured about 8 years ago. She was also in Paulie that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home.<br /><br />Ms. Eisenberg made many TV and movie appearances in 99-00 but then was not seen much for the next few years. Shes now 14 and is growing up to be a beautiful woman. Her smile really warms up the screen. If she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career (or better?) than Haley Joel Osment another three named kid actor but hopefully without some of the problems that Osment has been in lately.<br /><br />Anywhozitz according to my 8 y.o. son who just finished reading the story the film did not seem to follow the book all that well but was entertaining none the less. The ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels (How to Eat Boiled Slugs? Escargot Kids Style?) which might not be such a bad thing. It was nice to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language violence or sex scenes.<br /><br />One other good aspect of the movie was the respect/fear engendered by the principal Mr. Burdock (Boilerplate). Movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons. While he has one particular goofy scene he ruled the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin getting some work.',pos

'Although I am generally a proponent of the well-made film I do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries and more often than not I do enjoy and admire films that successfully break the rules. And it is quite true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema. But it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point.<br /><br />Pasolinis work is visually jarring but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. This is true of DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors and while many directors have done so with remarkable result under Pasolinis direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors. This is also true of DECAMERON. Pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock offend or otherwise disconcert the audience. Such elements can often be used with startling effect but in Pasolinis hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film. This is also true of DECAMERON.<br /><br />I have been given to understand there are many people who like even admire Pasolinis films. Even so I have never actually met any of them and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me. Judging him from his works alone I am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not break the rules so much by choice as by lack of skill--and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for  existential boldness thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker. I find his work tedious unimpressive and pretentious. And this too is true of DECAMERON. It is also sadly true of virtually every Pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure.',neg

This movie lacked substance and intensity.OK I get it the Finns put up one hell of a fight and thats great but the story is poorly told. You dont have any real connection with any of the characters and theres no real story line to follow. You just go from one random scene to another nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be conveyed. If you want a war movie that will keep you riveted and amazingly enough without battles scenes then I would suggest Downfall (WWII German film). Or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of action then I would suggest Brotherhood of War (Korean war/Korean film). These two movies will not let you down as Winter War will.',neg
'I found Dominion to be a lousy attempt to continue the success of the story. The original movie was a story about evil and how it can infiltrate our lives.<br /><br />Schraders version is lacking in evil. Viewers do not get an overwhelming sense of dread fear or even foreboding. Harlins version offers evident evil shows violations of the churchs sanctity and builds a convincing story that is plausible given Father Merrins background. Schraders story leaves one wondering exactly what happened. Dominion does not evoke the emotions of the viewers to empathize with Father Merrin and leaves the viewer wondering exactly why he was troubled in the first place.<br /><br />Anyone interested in seeing a sequel which lives up to the original should see Exorcist: The Beginning.',neg

'Great film a very worthy 7/10.<br /><br />Tom Hanks was at his usual best the heavy drinking congressman who saved Afghanistan from its communist oppressors! Based upon a true story tells us how the West throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away. Well it did go away albeit temporarily. Look who we (the British amongst others) are now fighting the very same people who the US gave arms training and money to in the 80s.<br /><br />This film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice story. However once the main objective is achieved i.e. ridding the communists from Afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten about.<br /><br />This film was good it was a well deserved 7/10. It told the story of the Communist invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the US to some detail and was dramatised well. Although being a good film I will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good (US) v evil (Russia) isnt your thing!',pos

'Great adaptation of the Christie novel. Surprising attention to authentic period details for the time (Many films of the mid-1970s-early 80s that try to do 1920s-early 30s look far too mid-70s-early 80s for my liking so expected the worst here and was gladly proved wrong)The costumes and sets are very well done. I liked this production very much  largely due to the adorable Francesca Annis portrayal of a carefree bright young Lady Frankie and James Warwicks charming Bobbie. The pair would go on to portray Christies Tommy & Tuppence which is funny as some contemporary book critics compared Frankie and Bobby to her earlier characters of Tommy & Tuppence. The supporting characters were equally well done  the over the top Mrs. Rivington (acted by Miss Marple-to-be Joan H.) and Badger is played perfectly as the post WWI Bertie Wooster type.',pos
'Smithereens is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library. A worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director Seidelman the film is fraught with bad acting bad sound bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of lifes great mysteries. (D-)',neg
'Holy @#\%& this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of Lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen. I rank this well below anything I have ever watched on film or TV and thats saying something. I once witnessed a cow crap in a field. I watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half who knows... it might have moved or something. Well that was time better spent than watching this tripe. The acting was non-existent the plot was somewhere other than on this film. I think I saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to Portland in hopes of becoming a Steven King shi77er. Please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs. Its pretty clear he needs heavy medication and Id willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal. Bah... I cant give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone. Let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this Chilton on the rack walk to your car start the engine then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you cant feel your bones vibrate anymore. Be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself.<br /><br />By the way I watched this after a buddy of mine sent his girlfriend over so I could see it. HE dint come over SHE had too. Whats worse is that she had to watch this $\%&@ thing TWICE! I heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month. I hope it was because of this film.',neg
'Hulk Hogan and Zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors. Hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal Ill never know why.

'foywonders review of this cheap STV hits the nail squarely on the head. Make sure you read it. In case you dont a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard. The Big Foot family doesnt take kindly to this and proceeds to pick off the team one by one largely offscreen. Big Foot himself has a distinctly ape-like face but is less scary overall than Harry from HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Most of the movie has the wooden generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away. This is a no-budget movie in which very little happens at least on screen. We do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches but nothing comes of this.',neg
'SPOILER!!!! Mind Ripper hmmmm.... I had just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and had just found out about Giovanni Ribisi. I thought Giovanni Ribisi hadnt done any horrors so I checked into it. I saw the outpost (mind ripper) I checked on my Tivo for it. There was an air date on Sci Fi. So I was set. I got my pop corn ready came in and set on the couch and what the hell is this? A freakin bold guy in blue sweat pants running around yelling! Nothing is scary about this movie at all! If anything its funny! Funny how low the budget is funny how predictable it is funny how bad the acting is and funny how much money it DIDNT make. Ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor but this movie is dumb. It is so stupid. They killed him at the end and then they go on this plane and the monster is on it. They shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls a long way to the ground. And<br /><br />-GASP- The killer ending Its Still Alive! WOOHHH! Scary! woooohhhh! Sucky fat sack of crap waste of 2 hours.<br /><br />Bottom Line: You have somewhere to go and you need to kill some time. Mind ripper isnt the suggestion. Id rather sit out naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: F- - - - - - - - - - (ENTERNAL)',neg
'Well this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and producers think we all are idiots. If not how should we understand this:<br /><br />American pilots take off on Mig-29s.

The magic again!<br /><br />Oh did I mention that F-16s had Israel markings? <br /><br />Another magic: obviously unarmed L-39 trainers are bombing enemies.<br /><br />And more magic: while all movie is situated in Europe we can see a desert in almost any flying scene.<br /><br />Maybe the director wasted all his magic on things above because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look awfully as if pilots bombarded with molotovs.<br /><br />OK OK this is a movie. I should write about its story... wait. A story? Yes there is SOME story in this film. And its horrible as well.',neg

'While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review I really didnt like this film even though it had so many similarities. Both were made just a few years apart both starred Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies. However the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME overall just seemed like a cheaper film--with poor writing little energy and some VERY broad performances--even when compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting Jayne Mansfield. The combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this A-budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio. Plus there wasnt much chemistry or energy in pairing her with Cary Grant--an actor generally loved for his grace and class. Its sort of like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.',neg
'In general I prefer horror movies that creep me out so much Im afraid of everything for the next day or so not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra of legend is a dog-faced lizard-skin greenish-gray monster that hops like a kangaroo has fangs and claws has a row of sharp spines sticking out from its back and sucks the blood of livestock. As in many horror movies good and bad this movie takes liberty with the legend. It not only attacks humans but it eats their intestines and has a bulletproof nearly indestructible constitution. So tell me how can a hypodermic needle penetrate its skin when bullets cant? And why when the marines figure out that armor-piercing bullets can hurt it do they split up so the chupacabra can pick them off one by one? John Rhys-Davies gives a performance that rises above the bad movie and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal deserve credit for their performances too. Otherwise the rest of the acting was poor to bad just like the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Davies Simmons and Neal.',neg
'When this series aired I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of The Fugitive and The Incredible Hulk where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. In this case the heros problem is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. Problem is: They cancelled it before it had a chance to end. (either that or I missed the last episodes).<br /><br />They never got a chance to wrap up the story either knowing it had been cancelled. Poof it was just gone. However like I said before I might have missed the last episodes. But my proof to the contrary is this: I rented the tape. Where I left off in the series. The lead characters wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving Kings famous organization the Shop. While getting away hero is kidnapped. It ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the Shop. The end. Last episode. On the video: His wife does not die but escapes the fire with him. Right when he should get nabbed by the Shop he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence. Abrupt silly and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was. They might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb detonations. Almost Pythonesque.<br /><br />The show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the David Bowie song of the same name',neg
'I wasted 5.75 to see this crappy movie so I just want to know a few things:<br /><br />What was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie the disease had nothing to do with being split in half.<br /><br />What was the point of dragging Karen into the shed she already totally infected her room they could have just locked her in there where she would have been safer.<br /><br />Why would the Hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative the hog lady to take him to the hospital?<br /><br />Why didnt any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad are they all really that lazy?<br /><br />Even if Paul was threatened by the guy w/ the shotgun for peeping on his wife Paul could have just sent Jeff or Bert back to the house to ask for help. the girl he loves is deteriorating.<br /><br />What was the point of the box?<br /><br />Why did Jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldnt he have just gone back home?<br /><br />If the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit why did they throw Paul halfway into the river it wasnt even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated.<br /><br />Who makes lemonade out of river water that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it.

'In the first twenty minutes we are swept away by several powerfully portrayed emotions: a suffocating and overbearing mother has a violent argument with her live-in 40yr old daughter; a piano teacher (and professor of music)s love for her pupils expressed in unswerving critical appraisal; the joy that music can inspire both in the listener and the performer. Within this short space of time our senses have been assaulted convincingly with very real characters. We are also swept away by powerfully performed music and shown the difference between great and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuance. Such material alone would have been the basis for an outstanding film of widespread appeal. But the trend in French cinema being what it is it goes deeper exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent breakdown within a context of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. We are drawn to her suffering and at least initially wonder how much suffering may be related to the accomplishment of genius particularly in the composers she admires. The Piano Teacher contains graphic dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people might rather not watch. The scenes are essential to the dilemmas which the film seeks to raise and so can hardly be called gratuitous. A great film it may be but mainstream viewing it is not.',pos

'Old movie buffs will know why Id call this one The Man in the Grey Flannel Robe. Most Bible-based movies are basically schlock- what might call forth smiles and giggles here is how Peck tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying Neanderthals all about him. As a Great Romance it falls flat as unleavened bread. But there is something gripping about this movie. Of all the big Hollywood Bible pictures it most strikingly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the Average American towards belief in the Biblical God. Billy Sundays thesis is duking it out with H.L. Menckens antithesis all through the script. Who gets the better of it in the Heavenly Chorus-backed synthesis depends on your point of view. Other than that D & B boasts a good performances by Peck ( especially in the closing repentance scene) and by Jayne Meadows as his bitter first wife Michol vivid moody atmosphere (good idea to set most action at dawn or night) and the rousing rendition of the Twenty-Third Psalm at the end.',pos
'Every time this movie used to re-air on late night TV in the late 70s and early 80s I would always make time to sit in front of the TV and watch it. To see the lovely Kate Jackson handsome Richard Long the great Polly Bergen whom Ive never seen anywhere else except for this TV movie the endearing Tom Bosley and another great whom Ive never seen outside this movie Celeste Holme. This is truly the love boat on a cruise to murder and mayhem and boy was it ever good!! And every time I would watch it I would always forget who the real murderer was.<br /><br />As expected someone here is already criticizing the movie as if that really is a big help to anyone. This is a great TV movie and worth watching each and every time. I cant say that about half the movies Ive seen this month.<br /><br />If you ever get a chance to watch it on TV someday which isnt likely watch it. In light of The Girl Most Likely To finally coming out this year on DVD maybe theres hope for a DVD release of Death Cruise.',pos
'Relentless like one of those loud action movies. The entire cast seems to be on speed. I didnt quite get the directors intentions if any. I wonder if shes ever seen a Stanley Donen Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure please! This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba. The costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and youll understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience however seemed to enjoy it so it probably its just me.',neg
'I saw this recently with my wife and discovered its better than Caine believes although its not much cop. Britains greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing. Rex Harrison seems even less bothered perhaps unsurprisingly as his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better but his screen time is fleeting and again his character is not well scripted.<br /><br />Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen but is given very little to do the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the films serious tone. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now).<br /><br />Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director and this is one of his weaker movies.',neg

'At least it is with this episode. Here we have a time traveler the Professor from Gilligans Island no less going back in time to 1865. What does one do--why try to save Lincoln of course! No really interesting variations are rung on this old theme. As another reviewer has stated this episode is particularly drab and unstylish with little to suggest that the Professor really is back in the 1860s. Budget limitations are readily apparent and the direction is stolid. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark but it remains a very flat production. We too often feel we are on stage sets waiting for something clever to happen. There is a minor twist at the end but I emphasize minor.',neg
'This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80s and this one is even better. Sylia Nene Linna and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp the characters are well-developed and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence but most of it is against robots and there is some fan service but nothing too racy. The DVDs also have many extras including commentaries which really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show. A must-have for any anime fan.<br /><br />Also recommended: Burst Angel Armitage III',pos
'I just finished watching this movie and largely found it a waste of time with little or no redeeming factors. I really dont understand where all the positive reviews came from -- the animation is clunky and unrefined the plot makes no sense at all from an objective standpoint and there is no sense of intrigue or suspense in that which is trying to pass itself off as an intriguing and suspenseful film. I have never read the book so I cant say if the movie was faithful but as with most movie adaptations it tries too hard to cram as much information into the shortest amount of time possible. The result is a disjointed and illogical storyline that doesnt really let you understand or relate to the characters or actually anything at all. Overall I felt completely detached from the characters and the plot to the point where I couldnt bring myself to care about what happened to them and the only way I can see how this animation could be considered beautiful is if your normal standard of animation is a Scooby-Doo cartoon.',neg
'It occurred to me while the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of Buddy Hollys death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in Clearlake Iowa who remember it vividly. That has to be a haunting memory lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of American Pie as it pays tribute to the day the music died. The world lost some tremendous talent that day lives cut short way before their prime and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacy.<br /><br />I watched the film today some thirty years after its original theatrical release. Thirty years I have some trouble wrapping my mind around that. I had forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little things like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the bands name. But most of all I remember the music. Its hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of Oh Boy or Thatll Be The Day and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes. Im with Buddy on that score at least how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them? Funny how each successive decade brought its own threat to the fabric of society - The Beatles Motown Disco and a whole host of other musical forms. Were still listening and dancing to the beat so I guess they couldnt have been all that bad.<br /><br />There was another takeaway from the film I had forgotten about. This is where I learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasnt seeing things my way. Ive done that a number of times over the years but by now had forgotten the source. Well I should be good for another thirty years or so now.<br /><br />You certainly have to give Gary Busey credit for his portrayal of Buddy Holly. Seeing him today one could never imagine him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned Busey an Oscar nod. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are competent as Buddys band members though their characters take a back seat to much of the story. I enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture names like Sam Cooke and King Curtis without ever dwelling on their presence. <br /><br />Ill always be a fan and follower of music from the Fifties and Sixties - oldies they call them now. I guess that makes me a bit of an oldie too but you cant replace the experience of growing up with the music history that now makes it to the big screen. Which only goes to reinforce the idea that Ill keep on enjoying the music until well the day I die.',pos
'I was so excited when I discovered this was available! I couldnt wait to see it. What a waste of energy! Its kind of like that rarities CD by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store. Being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery. But once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album. This DVD is only recommended for completionists who must have everything Lynch has done. Six Men Getting Sick is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive. It lacks the power of Lynchs later work The Grandmother is quite simply an immature work. Its tedious and looks like a student film. But it was the 70s...Its interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. But you can see briefly the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds. The Alpahabet is forgettable (No really! I cant remember this one at all!) The Amputee is pointless. The Cowboy and the Frenchman is just plain silly. Lumiere is the only worthwhile one in the bunch. Without dialog Lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work. I had to watch this one several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the DVD.',neg
'The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated especially for this country. I dont think most people know what a walker is or will really care. I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70s. The subject was just not believable for the year 2007 even being set in DC. I think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end. Most didnt stay for the Q&A either.<br /><br />I dont think Schrader really thought the film out ahead of time. Many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didnt know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on. I really didnt get Woodys (Carter) private life or boyfriend either. What were all the artistic male bondage and torture pictures (from Iraq prisons) about? What was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for Woodys character (Car). It didnt work. It didnt even seem to make sense really.<br /><br />The only good thing about this film was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) flawlessly. You really did get a great sense of what a walker may have been like (say twenty years ago). He was great and most likely will never get recognized for it. <br /><br />As for Lauren Lily and Kristin... Boring.<br /><br />Dont see it! It is painful! Unless you are a true Harrelson fan.',neg
'Overall an extremely disappointing picture. Very very slow build up to the basic storyline. The role of Maria Schrader searching for her families secret past. (Every take seems to last forever. There is really no rhythm in the film.) ***SPOILERS*** Her Mother Ruth is rescued from the Nazis by a German woman played by Katja Riemann. The entire character of Ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical. ***SPOILERS END*** The film cuts back and forth between present day New York and Berlin and Berlin 40s something. Please when you do that give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place. There is never a clear indication of time  very annoying. Worst part is the end. ***SPOILERS*** The entire show and jabber about the Jews being so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. Thats how the Jews got out of the Rosenstrasse? The question of who freed the Jews is NEVER answered. Was is Goebels who freed them? Did Lean Fischer sleep with Goebels? In Venice the film won an acting award for K. Riemann why?  I have no idea. Must be the Jewish theme',neg
'This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years. His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it. I HIGHLY recommend this one. The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow but the ending jokes in French are quite good because you dont have to speak French to get it (although if you do it is still hilarious). Also the parts about being a transvestite are quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great but funny the first time. Skip over those if you can. Its almost not worth watching. However this really is a funny funny stand-up show that everyone should see. I was dead at the time!',pos
'Being a great fan of Disney i was really disappointed when i watched this garbage.The animation was prettyand the backgrounds were amazingbut i believe that good animation does not make up for a weak scriptand weak story. Im gonna have to disagree with the people who say it is not suitable for children.Yes there are some deaths in the movie but isnt death something that children should at least be exposed to? But i digress. The script is riddled with bad puns and lame jokes...the kind i could expect from most dreamworks movies. The music was soppythe morals forced(and forced without any charm whatsoever.)and the characters would burst into song at totally inappropriate times.The characters were also coldand i really couldnt muster up any form of emotion towards them(bar irritation).

'This film would be particularly fun for anyone who has been in the film industry especially in any indie capacity... those whose inheritance includes a film introduction may not appreciate it quite as much. I am hard to please in the documentary category. This doc is different though- its pleasure comes from an earthy realism of indie filmmaker punks who are a hoot to be around and watch. Whether youve ever wondered what it is like to be in films in front of or behind the camera or whether you have worked your way through the sometimes painful and hard but rewarding indie world youll certainly get a kick out of this film.',pos

From the description the cable had atleast. This film was awful. Its slow the pacing is horrible it feels as tho it lasts 4 hours. Theres no real plot to speak of...agh! How can anyone say anything good about this movie. Rickman is good...but he always is...the other two characters work well but theres no real story to support any of it. After 2 hours and you sitting there wondering what on earth is going on where on earth is the plot- it ends with a surprise that frankly just made me sick. Dont bother with this one.',neg
'So dont even think about renting this from the shops because this is one hell of a bad movie. Youd think that JJ Abrahams had written this movie. Basically a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out. Fans of the completely terrible Shrek might enjoy but Wallace & Gromit fans will probably turn away in disgust. Also why didnt they do it in plasticine or clay? I mean CGI animation?? For an AARDMAN movie??!! Obviously Aardman lazed around while they let Dreamworks do the whole thing. Wrong wrong WRONG!!! Nearly every single character is awful apart from that freaky frog guy who is just right for a movie villain. But everything else about the movie is DULL DULL DULL!!!

'Labored comedy has I.R.S. agent Tony Randall investigating eccentric farm family in Maryland who have never paid their taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the tomboy farmers daughter who puts the squeeze on the not-so-disinterested tax-man. Debbie certainly made her share of inferior theatrical sitcoms during this period--and this ones no better or worse than the rest. Picture begins brightly but flags at the halfway point becoming frantic and witless. Randall isnt a bad match for Reynolds but the vehicle itself defeats the chemistry. Based on the novel The Darling Buds of May by H.E. Bates with a poor sound-mix causing all the actors to sound as if theyre stuck in an echo chamber. ** from ****',neg
'The Wicker Man starring Nicolas Cage is by no means a good movie but I cant really say its one I regret watching. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl has a hallucination followed by another hallucination followed by a dream sequence- with a hallucination etc. but its just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. Instead heres five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man even though its bad: <br /><br />5. Its hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it the only problem is in its cheesy unintentionally funny execution. If nothing else this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film or even read the short story on which it is based.<br /><br />4. For a cheesy horror/thriller it is really aesthetically pleasing. Its pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets so we get to see some very great scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. It is a very good looking movie.<br /><br />3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether youre a fan of his or not it seems as if its impossible for Cage to play a normal guy. There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays and personally I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible he always brings his unique energy into play and he is never boring to watch. He is terrible in The Wicker Man but in the most wonderful kind of way.<br /><br />2. A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist movie ever made. See? you could write this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society! Also the similarities between this Summersisle society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting.<br /><br />1. If youre reading this theres probably a good chance you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of highlights from the movie including Cage running around in a bear suit and of course the infamous AAGHH!! THE BEES!! MY EYES!!! line. These scenes are hilarious out of context and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the films entirety.<br /><br />I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about 5 dollars...when you work that out its about a dollar per reason. Its a pretty good deal.<br /><br />NOTE: The Unrated version of the movie is the best to watch and its better to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue which features a cameo from James Franco.',neg
'I like 50s sci-fi movies a lot. I like the really good ones (such as The Day the Earth Stood Still When Worlds Collide Invasion of the Body Snatchers and many others) and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends (such as Plan 9 From Outer Space). However when a sci-fi movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun it really should be avoided. This movie is just such a film. The posters make it appear as some sort of sexy she-beast is attacking mankind whereas the real plot is a lot less interesting. A woman is married to a womanizer. She is contaminated and begins to grow to a HUGE size and decides to track down this worm and kick his tail and thats about it. Also many of the special effects really stink--especially the gigantic papier mache hand that comes into the room to grab the wicked hubby.',neg
'This was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that I shall never tire of watching many many times. The casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters good scripts and good acting. The movie public needs heroes not deviant manikins who lack ingenuity and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves. Thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer director producer and all those who did such a fine job.',pos
'What an unfortunate mess is Shiner. I wanted to like this over-the-top anti-film aspirant and in fact found a number of moments with powerful resonance. Sadly those moments are few and far between. While I appreciate some of what Calson was attempting any advantage aspired to by bare bones no budget cinematography was destroyed with some truly atrocious editing that benefited the movie not at all.<br /><br />While bad acting abounds in low budget (and big budget) cinema Shiner has some remarkably bad performances that are nearly painful to watch. In particular the straight couple Linda and Young Guy. These are the two most poorly written characters offering almost nothing to the story. The acting is so abysmal and neither actor seems capable of resisting smirking or cracking up as they drearily drop their lines with an appalling lack of skill. The choppy editing almost lends the feeling that these roles were entirely gratuitous and dropped in to avoid the films being stereotypically cast as an oddball gay film. It would have been better off as such.<br /><br />With all that is going wrong for it there are several performances that seem to capture what Calson was hoping to get. In particular the story centering on Bob and Tim. These are the two most richly drawn characters and offer the most rewards with genuinely captivating performances by Nicholas T. King (Bob) and David Zelinas (Tim). Tim is a boxer with some serious issues. Remarkably low self esteem is disguised by an almost cartoon like arrogance that he wears like armour plating. Obsessed with Tim the seemingly harmless yet ultimately creepy Bob stalks the boxer in classic cat-and-mouse fashion. When the tables are turned and hunter becomes the hunted the resulting in the films only genuine emotional catharsis. In a film so artificially hard-edged (thats a compliment) one character MUST have that revelatory break through (or breakdown as the case proves here) and the final confrontation between Bob and Tim provide Zelinas and King opportunity to display some real acting chops.<br /><br />As played by Scott Stepp and Derris Nile Tony and Danny seem to be the focus of the movie and despite some bravado moments of their own (including one truly disturbing scene revealing the sex/violence obsession) but they cant seem to escape a cartoon-like artifice and its difficult to look at - or beyond their seeming one note symphony and find anything other than the obvious.<br /><br />Ultimately this same raw material could (and should) be used to tell this story in better fashion. Alas there really isnt much to recommend this yet the performances by Messrs. King and Zelinas really do offer something special and a glimpse of what might have been and are ultimately worth seeing.',neg
'As a kid I thought this movie was great. It had animals it had beautiful music and it had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now I still love this movie for different reasons. It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. It has beautiful well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme that still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. And it has my favorite actor Michael J. Fox. <br /><br />Based on a book this is the story of three house pets an intelligent overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog Chance. The three are taken to a friends farm when their family goes away. Dismayed and worried the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So what maybe home IS just over that mountain. But what if it isnt? <br /><br />I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters and for anyone else that ... yeah everyone go watch it.',pos
'In 1982 two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens. Steven Spielbergs ET and John Carpenters The Thing. Of the two of them ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so entranced with Spielbergs warm fuzzy feelgood alien fable they stayed away from The Thing in droves.<br /><br />Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart. The other is a harsh uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Things tentacles and slime coated saliva!<br /><br />Its taken some time but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways. Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genres showrunner Alien. And thats even rarer!<br /><br />Carpenters film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting because its the perfect backdrop when youre trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on characterisation the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.<br /><br />Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns hot off the success of Escape From New York cast once again as one of Carpenters perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what theyre researching is anyones guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReadys trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.<br /><br />They end up dying for their troubles and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened they take in the Husky and add it to their own. Except that this Husky is not a Husky at all. But a shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice and when they thawed it out it massacred their crew. Capable of absorbing its victims at will it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.<br /><br />The Thing is one of John Carpenters finest films. In fact Im tempted to say its the best film hes ever made. Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenters list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didnt flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.<br /><br />But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its presence known Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly. And when he delivers his punches they come with an agonising jolt.<br /><br />The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem at odds with one another but in Carpenters hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects youll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the films effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!<br /><br />That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges the films values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to. Its in the films quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows whispers and implications. Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenters strong suits but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know anything about the cast it only makes the present situation that much more confusing. Were never certain from one moment to the next who is who. And because of this The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they blood-test each other to see whos human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.<br /><br />The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated film well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than ET!',pos
'<br /><br />I thought that this movie lacked the building dramatic suspense the first movie had. This is hard to accomplish when the film takes place over a week. The original movie lead up to the final climatic scene over a period of a year and it still was less violent than the sequel. One good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly because the plot seemed rushed. When Rachels best friend died there was no funeral mentioned in the movie. Another bring down was the involvement of Amy Irving. All her scenes brought down the movies pace. The dialog in this movie was terrible. It in no way reflected the way kids talk. In conclusion this movie could have been a hit but fell apart after the opening scene.',neg
'(May contain spoilers) This movie is the epitome of weirdness. I rented it hoping for a film so bad it would be funny. However I still honestly cant decide if this film was intended to be scary or humorous. It combines the emotions in a rather disturbing way. Apparently this is trying to be clever but in actual fact it isnt. For instance when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher it starts playing happy music. When we go to Toxico we have up-beat quasi-Mr. Rogers Neighborhood music. However when the little kids dreaming of falling in blood and when he finds the leg these are clearly intended to be tense. So watch this film and decide for yourself. It is too weird to be described in words and for that I say kudos.<br /><br />Nose-dive... WOW!',neg
'Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on face is a classic as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The take on lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently Im a lawyer he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malevolent than usual. The hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all-time classics. Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). This movie gets better each time I see it (which is quite often).',pos
'Chupacabra Terror: 2/10: It was the Navy Seal team that tipped the balance from bad cheesy movie to just bad. Up till then there was a lot of bad movie baggage but the Seals They are wearing bicycle helmets painted black. You know the ones with air holes that make every adult who wears them look like a complete tool. Of course the bass fishing boat they took to greet the cruise ship might have been another clue (it wouldnt make it across Tampa Bay let alone an ocean) and their tactics wouldnt pass muster on an 3rd rate XBOX game.<br /><br />Does director John Shepphird have photos of John Rhys-Davies in a compromising position with a Hobbit? Because I cant think of any other reason he would be in this movie. The other actors have a great excuse. They are talentless unattractive hacks that couldnt get hired for an infomercial. The plot is that two men try to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra (Love saying that name) aboard a cruise ship and it gets loose.<br /><br />The sets consist of horrible cruise ship fakery (complete with airshafts the size of a small apartment) the monster killings are bottom of the barrel there is no nudity and a lot of really bad actors refuse to finish their death scenes. Of particular annoyance is a gigolo character from a 60s Doris Day movie.<br /><br />The cast bleeds ketchup while the Chupacabra bleeds day green glow in the dark blood. (Why a goat eating Mexican mammal would bleed anything but red is beyond me.)<br /><br />Every B movie has a tipping point that makes it a fun time (Hey its a lesbian shower scene OMG that guy just ate is own eyeballs) or not so fun (Did they just call those forty something overweight guys wearing coveralls and bicycle helmets Navy Seals?) Chupacabra falls into the not so fun B movie side with a thud.',neg
'Well how to make a movie as provocative as possible? This cartoonishly straight shocker tries by having two low-life Paris women (one prostitute one recently raped ex-porn actress no less) lash out and go on a national sex-and-killing spree- of men in particular. <br /><br />Very short running time gives you a hint of the experimental nature of this violently hardcore Thelma & Louise- but its done completely without irony or contemplation for any possible feminist message... And since we dont get very close to the protagonists the violence actually feels muted and numbing- and maybe thats a good thing. <br /><br />As a liberal advocate of freedom of expression I always welcome when the serious movie industry dares to contain full-on sex scenes. But the question is: Does it work for the movie as a whole? Is it any good? Here not very although were given a new meaning to the phrase a shot in the ass! <br /><br />3 out of 10 from Ozjeppe',neg
'Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. Its a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.<br /><br />Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically great in her role. I only wish there was more of her in the film as I think most will agree. Its certainly refreshing to see her in a tight leather outfit.<br /><br />David Pasquesi was the aloof detached sidekick and voice of reason. Mina Kolb plays Jeffs mother who he lives with. There were numerous other cameos all of them done very well.<br /><br />At the premier Jeff mentioned his inability to do more with Bonnie due to production issues. Still its good to leave you wanting more. I think its that indie thing of keeping some things ambiguous to let the audience do some thinking for themselves to fill in the blanks. The wordy title should clue you in to this.<br /><br />Jeff said some of the basic characters were based on his past relationships. This explains why they work so well. Real life people are always unusually colorful and makes great characters. He departs quite a bit from what you might expect having seen Curb Your Enthusiasm and some of his other work. Its one of those break out things where an actor takes some risks to do something they maybe always wanted to do but couldnt.<br /><br />I think its noteworthy that Garlins improv Second City background and Hunts for that matter set the style here of acting being the focus of the story and the directing. Its perhaps a new innovative hybrid of improv meets indie film-making.',pos
'This is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the worlds best. The National Ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. BUT WE MAKE BLOODY AWFUL MOVIES! This one isnt especially bad. Its especially typical and typically bad shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction high school level acting and gee whiz...lets see what this button on the camera does?? photography. If Michael Moriarity was so intent on doing a Jack Nicholson impersonation couldnt he at least have done a GOOD Jack Nicholson impersonation? And if the movie was shot in Vancouver truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building (part of the plot) why in Gods name do we let that endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as Seattle???

'Without doubt one of the worst films ever made. Sluggish and without structure tension or story the film coasts on the thin premise of putting together a show. Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their inception and dialogue is random and incidental. Everything is put together in a slapdash order and often Stepping Out feels more like a deleted scenes reel than an actual movie. The film seems to exist merely as a showcase for gaudy and totally random Liza musical numbers. Shelly Winters can be seen in the far superior octo-epic Tentacles and the REAL Liza can be found in the Showtime release of Queer Duck: The Movie.',neg
'Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce direct finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? <br /><br />This film does not answer the latter question either way but it does appear that without Curb Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. <br /><br />Like most new producers/directors Jeff Garlins independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb). And yet is it a sensitive guy film? He isnt really a sensitive guy. Likable sure. Relatable indeed. <br /><br />What this film really is about is a bit hard to say I can only relate what I took away from it. <br /><br />I rented the film because of the trailers particularly the scene of a counselor portrayed by Amy Sedaris informing James Aaron (Garlin) that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because she is a chubby chaser. I just about fell out of my seat. Based on that scene alone I ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie. The reason - I thought the school counselor (Sedaris) was talking about Beth portrayed by Sarah Silverman. I imagined a lightish romantic comedy between the foxy Silverman and the fat Garlin. I didnt think the story would be anything original but that the dialogue would be snappy and the scenes would move along at a satisfying pace. In short I thought it would be a comedy. <br /><br />It was intriguing that the film started out that way but then took a much much more realistic turn when Beth gives James the heave ho because Ive never really been with a fat guy before. That is how brutally we live life and it was completely realistic. I applaud the decision. It just meant that Beth has now left the building and with her the one snappy person in the film.<br /><br />Jamess relationship with his mother was also interesting. That part made me wonder if the whole concept did not start out as a play. It had that intricate feel to it. (The whole Marty movie within a movie thing was utterly lost on me as I have never seen that film.)<br /><br />There were serious doubts I had about the character of James Aaron though. Is it really possible that at 39 he had not had a serious relationship? And he is an actor? That did not really square with me. To me his persona was less actor-y and more corporate. I could not really buy his ordinariness either. No doubt he was extremely disappointed that things with Beth did not work out. We felt that. But then did he really care? <br /><br />Another thing - how in the world can both he and his mother afford to move out at the same time? Hasnt he just lost his job? The last one he had? That was one reason he did not seem ordinary to me. Wheres the funding for his life coming from? <br /><br />And yet I have read reviews that talk about the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness so there is that. Yes it is very realistic the way we must be satisfied with what we have because it is all that we have. The way we sort of disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions (James and Stella) some kind of self-effacement that takes place just to move on to the next moment. That contrasted with the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments our thoughts the way James had with Beth its really crushing.<br /><br />Very well done.',pos

The forward-backward motion of the storyline was well-done and normally I dont enjoy movies with the flash-back/flash-forward effects. I felt during the whole evolution of the movie that surely Tommy did it. It leaves you with a sense of how these people lived their lives almost totally devoid of each other and the consequences of not having any desire to answer the question Its 10 oclock.

The supporting role of Shefali Shetty who played the role of Sumitra Thakur was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good in her small role she had in the movie.

'Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much of the young Audrey Hepburn and the camera in THE CRANES ARE FLYING seems to love her just as much. She is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of World War II in Moscow.<br /><br />The film is almost poetic in its gorgeous B&W cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place since I had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on TCM.<br /><br />Its a very moving love story about a girls deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime Russia. Shes unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from. Their marriage is a troubled one because she cant let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheart.<br /><br />By the end of the story she accepts the idea that hes never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation. Theres a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous families.<br /><br />The stylish and striking camera-work is what carries the film as well as the honestly played story.<br /><br />Tastefully done but perhaps the English subtitles didnt tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed over.<br /><br />Summing up: Easy to see why it won awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Reminded me in style of another great Russian film BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.',pos
'Bergman and comedy dont quite go together. Some of his comedies are so naff you almost wince. This film has the odd naff moment - the last 30 seconds being the nadir but on the whole this is a charming (rather than funny) piece enjoyable throughout. Bergman casts several of his usual suspects who perform well. There is a great scene on the train between David Marianne and an uncouth salesman which will stick in the memory. Some of the marriage material is typical cynical Bergman but this is Bergman in a light rather than dark mood.<br /><br />This film has its moments and is worth the 90-odd minutes. Not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall for Bergman.',pos

'This move is bad on so many levels I dont even know where to start. OK - the good points - Peebles is beautiful as a dirty outlaw in black leather. Some of the landscape photography was stunning. Thats about it. Oh and it was a nice touch having the buffalo head above the bar door in Freemanville I figure it was a nod to the Buffalo Soldiers. The movie starts sort of OK but the characters are so flat so comic book so much the bad guys are just over the top bad I choke trying to describe them further. The Spanish-Cuban-American war was 1895-1898 with America being involved only in April to August of 98. I think the movie said it took place in 1893 (I could be wrong but I dont want to look at it again to check). A big part of this movie hinged on the KKK killing Jessies daddy. Well boys the original KKK started in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The Klan wasnt even around during the time period of this movie. Of course the nasty bas**rds got busy again in 1915 and we know the rest of that. BUT for the purpose of the movie it is historically incorrect and that was a major part of the plot. I think I could make myself crazy going into it a lot more so here a few jabs and Im done. I didnt know that Boyz2Men and other bands like that got their inspiration from New Orleans street singers from the 1890s. I also didnt know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for Sioux women in the 1890s...but then I was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic 1 nails...

'Its hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become especially if like me you happen to like the TV show more. But theres a lot to be said for the source.<br /><br />Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a top New York City sportswriter who lives in an eight-room apartment by himself a casualty of divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy mindset. Enter his friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon) needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubbornly neatnik mindset. The result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a Neil Simon stage play.<br /><br />First things first: I love that apartment! Poker table novelty dart board askew photos of baseball players empty booze and beer containers even a pair of Roman columns. Its a place where men can be boys. Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening up the stage plays single set Oscars living room by moving the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the mounting tension between Oscar and Felix more corners to bounce off of.<br /><br />Neal Heftis familiar score was heard on the TV show but never so sweepingly orchestrated as it is here in several different arrangements that make the on-screen action soar whenever its played. Real location work and night shots of Manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time (Buddwing The World Of Henry Orient Midnight Cowboy Manchurian Candidate Rosemarys Baby etc.)<br /><br />Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy in comparison to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be fair the movie is meant to be a more serious affair dealing with the then-uncommon condition of mid-life divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work. Simon has more in mind than entering Felix and Oscar in a game of Password or a battle of wits with Howard Cosell. But I dont know...<br /><br />Both Lemmon and Matthau were terrific comedians I enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as I often do in their separate movies but I never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team. Here in their best-regarded partnership they seem to be acting in two different films; Lemmon in a comedy-drama and Matthau in a farce. Matthau is great in the beginning charming us with his teddy-bear demeanor around the poker table but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like Jack Torrances in The Shining reacting to Felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blame.<br /><br />While the ending bothers me the part many see as the most jarring the beginning works fine as I see it. Watching Felix stumbling around trying to kill himself isnt great comedy no but its a good way to get into a great comedy setting us up with some real-life pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter. (Plus it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city.) In the middle of the movie this scene would have been a miscalculation but it works as a way of establishing Felixs torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see Oscar and his poker friends bicker and feud.<br /><br />Thats where Simons lines are so great. They are the underlying strength of the film. He gets the banter exactly right and real and still makes it funny. I dont mind you talking Felix. You got things to say. Whats scaring me is Im beginning to listen. The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better in fact the TV show once made a good point about assuming anything at all but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right.',pos
'I am still waiting for that dark muppet film where we wont know how it ends from the beginning. I think Linklater could do one hes experimented with animation. This time I was intelligently not expecting such a thing but deeply wishing.<br /><br />Joan Cusack sucked. She moved to a made-for-tv level lazily acting this one with cliched cynic. The muppets were more life-life than she was. A disappointment.<br /><br />But then the entire film was bar Pepe. I loved him. He was the only one to ever get me laugh(while Goldbergh as God got me choking and cursing). If we cant see a dark muppets than how about at least a PG:13 one with more of Pepes controversial jokes and Animals metal-head egg-nog-chuggin persona.<br /><br />The worst Muppets I saw even the boring Christmas Carol beats this one out. The muppets need to avoid this over commercialized holiday.<br /><br />5/10',neg
'In order to describe whats seriously wrong with this movie it has to contain some *spoilers* so if youre going to see it and expect to be surprised dont read this!<br /><br />I liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in a thriller like this believable plot is essential. It is well acted if a bit slow moving and the camera work and Portland scenes are exquisite for a low-budget unpretentious picture. The dialog is very good. <br /><br />Mason is seriously withdrawn youth who works at a telemarketing company selling insurance. His high school buddy Berkeley is his employer and looks after him like a brother despite the fact that Mason is quite obviously mentally ill. Mason has nightmares which send him gasping and fumbling for his inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with good-looking women in his past and the movie seems to be suggesting that he may be a serial killer of women. He meets a perky pretty girl named Amber and he sketches her in his notebook. She takes a liking to him and poses for him so he can paint her portrait. He sees more of her and begins to awaken from his withdrawn state almost becoming halfway human. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder. She becomes frightened and pulls away. We are wondering if her sudden coldness is going to push him over the edge. His behavior becomes more erratic. <br /><br />This is the setup for the revelation. In order to explain how this movie goes horribly wrong I have to explain what happens. *Another spoiler warning!* In order for this plot to work we have believe that Amber a really outgoing pretty young girl is going to go for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who at least at the beginning of their friendship has a vacant stare and can only speak in monosyllables or doesnt speak at all. Hes way beyond nerdy he appears on the verge of total catatonia. Yes I know girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdos but usually the Charles Manson type or punk rockers guys with some kind of evil manic energy. Mason is practically a zombie hes hardly there at all. Any perky young thing would cross the street to avoid him. It is just not believable that this girl is attracted to him. Moreover there is no credible reason for Berkeley to indulge the crazy Mason that just isnt believable either. <br /><br />But wait theres a revelation. Amber fails to show up at Berkeleys house for Christmas dinner where Mason is expecting her and Berkeley his old buddy has to tell him that Amber and all his other former girlfriends the ones he drew in his many sketchbooks dont exist at all! She and all the others are merely figments of his twisted imagination: he dreamed them up. <br /><br />Well this explains why a normal cute Amber would go for Mason shes just a figment of his imagination. This could have been the final revelation of the movie with the proper preparation and setup but alas its not. At this point Mason runs back to his apartment and finds Amber there...hes enraged he kills her. But now we are given to understand that Amber was in fact real not Masons imaginary girlfriend. <br /><br />In the end after being given proof that Amber actually exists and that Mason killed her Berkeley has to admit that he was wrong that he misjudged Mason. This would work if Mason had been halfway sane from the beginning but because we the audience always suspected him of being totally deranged and possibly a killer of women it is no surprise to us. We suspected what he was all along and cant understand why Berkeley couldnt see it. But then we are once again left to wonder: if she was real why Amber would be attracted to the catatonic Mason? <br /><br />To make the ending worse we are never given to understand whether all the other of Masons girlfriends the ones in the sketchbooks were real or was Amber the first real one? And if the others were real did he kill them too? What did he do with the bodies? <br /><br />The problem is that the filmmakers just didnt know what to do with the material. Perhaps there could have been a way to straighten it out and tell a credible suspense story but this movie is not that.',neg

'The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability. Ive got no problem with the human side of gansters being portrayed but Bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft comical men. The film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who though exciting was extremely dangerous and fearsome.<br /><br />The actings all good and the direction very solid. The locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?',neg
'This film was terrible. OK my favourite film is The Wicker Man (1973) so I was always bound to be a little biased. <br /><br />The plot rambles along throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term remake highly dubious. (Hes not a virgin but IS allergic to bees. WOW!) So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained which Im afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make. (How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film?) Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout and his character is prone to calling out Rowan!? at the slightest noise. The nods to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage. For example certain incidents mirror the original (The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward/Cage is searching the island) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.<br /><br />Im sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this I really cant be bothered to write any more about this film. It lacks any kind of substance. Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were based on (in this case very loosely).',neg
'From the opening drum hit of Were Gonna Groove to the last guitar hit of Whole Lotta Love this two-DVD set might be one of the best music DVDs ever to hit the shelves since the Beatles Anthology was finally released earlier this year.<br /><br />One of the best things about this DVD is that on Disc 1 a whole concert and many television appearances can be found. For instance the whole Royal Albert Hall concert is on the DVD as well as some of the best performances from the bands last concert at Knebworth.<br /><br />In the Royal Albert Hall concert for instance the band had a lot of room to improvise. Jimmy Pages guitar solos make Dazed And Confused a huge rock power ballad as opposed to the laid-back blues song it was on Led Zeppelin I. <br /><br />Next on DVD 2 is a promotional video for the Led Zeppelin III hit song Immigrant Song. One of Zeppelins hardest rocking songs the video is about as sketchy as a Pre-MTV video was but it displays a lot of guitar power by Jimmy Page as it was taken from a live performance. After the video ends we are treated in transition with a short picture of fans filling the seats at Madison Square Garden. The following are performances that were supposed to be part of The Song Remains The Same but did not make the cut. Excellent riffs like those in the songs Black Dog and The Ocean were both present.<br /><br />After the Madison Performances we are treated with Earls Court. Most of the Led Zeppelin IV material was played here like the most popular song that Zeppelin ever recorded Stairway to Heaven. It is brilliant as always even more so than the version on IV.<br /><br />Finally to end the 5+ hours of live material is Led Zeppelins final concert in Knebworth in August of 1979. As the viewer watches this they have to admit that Robert Plants voice is getting throatier and deeper from all of the screaming he has done in the past and it is evident here. On songs like Kashmir and In The Evening Plant does not have his vocal boost of old yet on Whole Lotta Love it returns for one more song.<br /><br />Overall one of the best musical DVDs ever released only next to the great Beatles Anthology boxed set that was released earlier in 2003. The sound both in 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital just like the Beatles DVD gives you a feeling of being on-stage with the performers standing right next to them as you would feel on the Beatles DVD when they are jamming in the studio. Even though The Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different bands though they each received different DVDs. Even though this set comes on only two discs compared to the five disc Beatles Set it still feels very filling to the viewer after they have gone through all of that content. It is also a pleasure to watch again and again not only because of the sound quality but because of the sheer energy on stage when Robert Plant begins to sing.<br /><br />A brilliant effort from Atlantic.',pos
'The Classic War of the Worlds by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate H. G. Wells classic book. Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so. I and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year e.g. the Spielberg version with Tom Cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie. Those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can. Others rate a movie on more important baseslike being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics. We enjoyed the effort Mr. Hines put into being faithful to H.G. Wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining. This made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings.',pos
'After seeing this film months ago it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and I feel I must buy it or at least see it again even though I watched it at least 3 times when I rented it at that point.<br /><br />I fell in love with Hal Hartleys directing many years ago - I found that these films could make me laugh in an place that is rarely entertained. It is a strange feeling granted and I assume most people out there really just dont get it or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable - I guess I just really get it - its as if these films were made for me.<br /><br />Although I dont remember if I actually laughed out loud during this film it remains one of the funniest films Ive seen in many years. If you dont see the humor of the grocery bag Fay carries from the street to a church to her brothers publishers office to her sons principals office you may lack the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film. The bag is a silent character in itself being dragged around as an icon of motherhood the usually brash bitchy Parker Posey must carry before the international intrigue of the remainder of the film besets her.<br /><br />I consider Henry Fool my least favorite of Hartleys films. I honestly dont remember it very well - I think the character himself was so despicable I found it tedious. Hartleys forte seems to be feminine character development.<br /><br />Aside from Poseys brilliance it was wonderful to see Elina Lowensohn one of my favorite actresses again. Her extravagant naiveté is perfect for Hartleys direction. His ability to make the outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony throughout.<br /><br />This film erupts into a highly relevant international intrigue story explaining political situations in Afganistan. This is never suspected at the beginning. The complexity of this films development is unparalleled.<br /><br />This is the epitome of a stand alone sequel. The less you know about Henry Fool the more mystery is spun around him the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film - as an alcoholic chain-smoking complaint machine hurling insults at his Islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him. Its like finding out Santa Claus is actually a 12-year-old schoolyard bully.<br /><br />Although I was impressed and satisfied with Hartleys other recent films the Girl from Monday and No Such Thing Fay Grim goes far beyond what I expected with a sense of humor and originality no Oscar winner would ever dare.',pos
'This movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description. But to me it was a bit of a let down. Very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening. It was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed (definitely not in sequential order). Also nothing of any consequence was being filmed. I have viewed quite a few different Korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewers part which is different from the typical Hollywood film. But this one befuddled me to no end. I viewed the film a second and third time and it still didnt do anything for me. I still dont really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. If it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a persons life I guess he succeeded. But I was looking for more. Needless to say I cant recommend this movie to anyone.',neg
'I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries to see 200 ton Blue Whales cruising through the Sea is an incredible sight they looked like submarines. I like the level of information and facts conveyed through the narration it is just right I dont want to know a load of science just some of the basics to see these things is enough for most people. The BBC has a knack of putting things at the right level for the intended audience.<br /><br />A really great documentary up there with The World at War for me the DVD is of excellent quality. If I had a minor criticism it would be some of the obviously added sound effects here and there I think they detract from some of the scenes. But well done to the BBC and Discovery.',pos

'This film along with WESTFRONT 1918 are my favorite Pabst-directed films and I enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORAS BOX). Its probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.<br /><br />In this case the film is about French and German coal miners so appropriately the people in the roles seem like miners--not actors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big mine it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine despite there being greater unemployment in Germany. This language differences (illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried in vain to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred. It was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Considering history though the films impact was minimal at best. Its a real shame as like this one WESTFRONT 1918 J?ACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion. So from a historical point of view its an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing.',pos
'If this is the best Commander Hamilton movie I have no curiosity about the others.<br /><br />A movie actors greatest tools are his eyes but when Peter Stormare wants to show great emotion he closes his so for five or six seconds we get to admire his eyelids while his feelings remain unknown behind them. Lousy acting technique.<br /><br />Stormare also flinches sometimes when he fires a gun turning his head away and clamping his eyes shut. Watch carefully. James Bond can rest easy with competition like this.<br /><br />There are some interesting supporting performances from other actors but not enough to hang a whole movie on. The cinematography is good-looking doing a fine job of capturing the Nordic cold. Even the Sahara winds up looking cold. Perhaps Hamilton carries his own climate with him.<br /><br />There are some individual good action sequences here. Unfortunately the only sense of humor on screen belongs to the villain which turns the hero into a big pill. James Bonds jokes may not be particularly good but at least he doesnt look constipated all the time.<br /><br />One positive point in the movies favor is that the psychotic contorted vicious hatred of Israel in Guillous books has been left out. What has been kept in is worship of a noble heroic PLO that he shows us functioning in Libya without the dictator Khaddafis knowledge or supervision. This fantasy is hard to believe since Khaddafi actually threw the PLO out of Libya for four years at a time. And at the end of the film Hamilton gives the PLO a very disturbing gift. Where will they use that gift? Hamilton doesnt care.<br /><br />Were a long long way away from For Whom the Bell Tolls here.<br /><br />Commander Hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. While Henning Mankells books sell well around the world Jan Guillou will never have the same success.<br /><br />As for this film bleeeeaaahhhhh.',neg

'This movie had good intentions and a good story to work with. The director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull boring filmstrip that made me feel like I was back in Mr. Hartfords 8th grade Social Studies class -- way back in 67.<br /><br />What a waste will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it.<br /><br />Every time a scene had potential all we were left with were a few clichés combined with black and white footage that they probably got from The History Channel to show the action. Shameful.<br /><br />Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this dull fest. The other acting was incredibly dull - it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the Captain set a new low standard for line delivery.<br /><br />However if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and arent concerned with being awed or entertained but want to learn about the USS Mason it is worth a watch.',neg

'I had never heard of Dead Mans Bounty when I saw it at the DVD store a few weeks ago and I thought I had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem since it had Val Kilmer in it in a truly unique role. Sadly it wasnt more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that I realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions. The first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long. Its unbelievable how bad it is. And sadly it doesnt get any better.<br /><br />Val Kilmer is featured prominently on the movies cover box maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of half-wit crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a unique town sheriff that Ive ever seen in a movie. Hes played by Boguslaw Linda who is unable to or uninterested in covering his Polish accent immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the American old west. <br /><br />Does Poland have this type of frontier past? I dont know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point but I can tell you this The Sheriff as he is known in the movie is the worst representation of law enforcement that I can ever remember seeing in a movie. He is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face. Before they start hitting him he explains that they can each hit him once and then after the first round they will each hit him again and if he can identify who is throwing the punches they lose. What the hell is this crap? I am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie. <br /><br />Throughout the movie the Sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally stumbling on screen and mumbling notwithout...the law You see there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie. <br /><br />It takes place by the way in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings facing each other across a flattened bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road. My understanding is that it is a part of Poland that is supposed to look acceptably enough like the American southwest where none of the characters except maybe the dead guy could possibly have come from.<br /><br />I have heard that Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role and also by director Uklanskis minimal use of dialogue in favor of a reliance on cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages. <br /><br />Yeah whatever. <br /><br />Seems to me that Kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role. Personally I would really feel that I had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while. I like to think that he didnt even read the script for this mess because if he did I am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the role.<br /><br />At any rate the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man played by Kilmer seeking the reward. Soon he finds himself embroiled in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute the alcoholic Sheriff and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid stupid characters. <br /><br />There is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of American rituals. In one scene a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into Kilmers eyes (for what reason I cant imagine) and then later a man makes a short speech over Kilmers corpse in which he explains that he was one of the finest men we ever had and then he proceeds to lop his head off with a shovel. What the HELL?? <br /><br />Not convinced yet? Here are some more reasons not to watch it. In one scene the Sheriff appears to be covered with ash except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red lipstick. A man gets a head wound that drenches his head and body in blood. In a daze he cauterizes it with gunpowder. Smart. Near the end the Sheriff appears to have a broken arm. Sitting at the bar he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm and uses his good arm to pull on the rope lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth rather than using his good arm to drink. Also smart. <br /><br />Why doesnt he just use his good arm? I have no idea. That like everything else in the movie makes no sense whatsoever like the title. Summer Love? Are you kidding me? Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /><br />In the meantime heres something for the IMDb Goofs page  <br /><br />Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers) : This movie got made. HA!',neg
'Age of Steel follows up the previous episode Rise of the Cybermen which was excellent in some respects lacking in others. RotC had some positive elements the most important being Tennants excellent portrayal of the Doctor. Indeed his sort of daft giddiness bears to this writer the shadow of Tom Bakers Doctor with his sort of subconscious asides (as when ticking off time periods when Mickey is holding down the button in the Tardis) yet brings his own aloof superiority a la McCoys Doctor as he lets events coalesce around him. Some reviewers and fans whose pieces Ive read seem a bit dismayed at having such a young actor portray someone who must by now be over a 1000 old but I disagree. Tennants Doctor does indeed bear the weight of the world on his shoulders as he points out in this episode and one can see this in his almost smug characterization as when he finally confronts Lumic/The Cybercontroller in the climax. His world-weary eyes-rolling anothermaniacherewegoagain sort of attitude is refreshing especially after Ecclestons excellent pseudo-working class bada** interpretation of the character more the man of action than Tennants fresh-faced pseudo-doofus. Tennants best moment is perhaps after the end when he is restoring the Tardis with his big goofy Baker-esquire grin as the Tardis re-starts. Here we begin to get a feeling for this new Doctor a character who is little more than the average persons different personality facets split up into 13 different people; some contradictory some more likable than others yet all forming part of a whole. This aside these two episodes were passable but weak. The concept of reviving the Cybermen is much welcomed and they look fantastic but the plot involving a parallel Earth where this action takes place doesnt seem to work right. True the allegory here of humans reliance on technology and their need to serve it as the Doctor points out is outstanding but this could easily have been placed on contemporary Earth or thereabouts. Some other weak spots are as others have pointed out the ease with which the Doctor and Co. get out of the tight spots viz. the death ray from the Tardis component the seemingly endless array of uses of the Sonic Screwdriver (my wife laughed when they were using it to burn through the rope ladder at the end; she has barely watched Who so I had to explain that it was used traditionally as a plot device to extricate the characters from situations from which there is no other escape! Used here sadly). Some of the acting was wanting especially Mickey who really needs his due and some of the supporting cast. Lumic was creepy as he needed to be his voice even sounded Cyberman-esquire. The score was horrific though with the musics volume often swamping out the scene. Overall I found Rise of the Cyberman more entertaining though the second half was passable. The build-up to what we knew was inevitable plays out well however the resolution was disappointing. Too many unlikely escapes no development of the supporting cast and not enough Tennant in my opinion. This new show is outstanding and Davies is taking it in a good direction but the dialogue (beyond the Doctors) needs to be tightened up as Mickeys farewells illustrate which were pure ham.',pos
'I have to point out before you read this review that in no way is this a statement against Iranian people ... if you really want to read something into it than hopefully you see that Im against politicians in general ... but if youre looking to be offended ... I cant help you!<br /><br />Not in Iran as this movie is banned there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). Which is a shame because the movie is great. Would it not be for Grbavica this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin.<br /><br />Rightfully so (it was the runner-up or second place if you will). Why? Because it is a movie about oppression. Its not even that this is a complete women issue. It is about the government trying to keep the people down. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie. But by banning it nothing is resolved and/or can they make this movie disappear! <br /><br />Another reviewer had a great summary line: Comedy about a tragedy that sums it up pretty well!',pos
'First off Mexican Werewolf in Texas title is misleading as many others have pointed out. It is actually about El Chupacabra which is a similar creature to a werewolf but by no means the same.<br /><br />The production and editing just plain suck. When it was over I probably wouldnt be able to give a very accurate description of what exactly the Chupacabra looked like for whenever it was in a scene(despite one or two exceptions) the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the monsters face clearly. The special effects were laughably bad but that has to be expected from a low budget horror movie.<br /><br />Along with the terrible production comes the bad actors. Now a couple give fairly plausible performances(Erika Fay and Martine Hughes) but then there were the bad actors(everybody else) who seemed to have no emotions whatsoever when people died. Then theres the absolutely terrible actor(Sara Erikson) who gives one of the 2 worst performances Ive ever seen in a movie. I mean my god she was indescribably bad.<br /><br />The plot was very simple. Basically a Chupacabra is in a small Texan town killing off local residents and a group of teens look to stop it. However even with the plot being this simple a few plot holes managed to leak through.<br /><br />Anyways horrible movie. However if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh at with your friends one night this would be a pretty good one. My friends and I had a good time watching this. Probably the 2nd worst movie Ive ever seen 1/10. Awful.',neg
'There are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is. What I wanted to point out is how this film took the largest science project in history and made it look small. The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge. Virtually all silver in the country went into making wire for electromagnetic separators. If there was every a choice between two alternative ways of doing things they just did both. The first sustained nuclear reactor was fired up under the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium with graduate students wielding axes as a scram mechanism. Its a fascinating story involving hundreds of locations and thousands of people that this film seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico.<br /><br />The other thing I really disliked was the huge moral debate over if we should continue the project after Germany surrenders. Okay we have thousands of (mostly) men who worked for years to make a really big boom. Does anyone think they didnt want to see it work? There was some controversy at the time about if we should use the device but it was not that serious clearly not the huge debate this film makes it out to be.',neg
'I cant believe I actually sat through the whole thing. This movie has the worst acting since Killjoy.<br /><br />Here is a brief outline of the plot: The movie starts out with Jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach drooling over a skinny blonde-haired beach hunk who looks like he hasnt been to the gym a day in his life. Somehow everyone knows him and every single chick in the movie wants him. UH OH! Here comes the competition! The stereotypical hot chick and her best friends who drive an ugly pink car. We soon find out Jojos mom got the job of a lifetime in Australia which means that Jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no I think Im gonna cry). A huge storm comes and fills their swimming pool with nasty water. Somehow for no apparent reason the little chick falls into the pool and comes face to face with yup you guessed it a MERMAID! This is where the story really takes off. Basically they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the hunk.<br /><br />This is a preteen flick with acting so bad it makes the 80s look like the pinnacle of Oscar-worthy performances. This movie has all the clichés possible... the best friends the hunk who everyone wants the hot bad girl and her bitchy friends the scary old man... you name it its in there. I took one for a lot of people by watching this. Consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you. Please dont see this movie. Dont make it so I suffered in vain.',neg
'Written and acted by sincere amateurs produced by some exploitation monger this is dull and hard to watch.<br /><br />Not the worst movie ever but at least schlock like _Plan 9 From Outer Space_ usually had a real actor or two.

'OK enough already. this is a terrible piece of television. the camera work is appalling (do i have to remind you of the crunchy gravel so loud you can hardly hear the actors speak) lady bertram has the most annoying voice in the entire world. anna massey is acting in such an unbelievable fashion. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is beyond beyond. also the bertram girls arent pretty enough and the guy playing henry crawford is awful. to say the camera work is dodgy is an understatement. i watched this adaptation over Christmas and i think under any other circumstances i would not have been able to endure this and certainly would have not been able to justify the wasted time.<br /><br />i am a fan of faithful to jane adaptations. so i could not bear the film adaptation or the recent pride and prejudice movie. but see any other adaptation instead even emma is better than this.',neg
'This movie surprised me! Not ever having heard of Hyde of Gackt I was not expecting much! The reason I wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in John Woo style! Normally I am very careful when this is claimed! There is only one John Woo and til this day there hasnt been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action! The fact that Moon Child would feature a vampire convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires! Sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow! It takes its time to set the mood! This movie contains some nice Hong Kong style action scenes! But Moon Child isnt an action movie! It is a drama about friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relation to each other! The pop singers Hyde and Gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends! The only problem I had was with the plot! A couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip! Example:When one member of the gang dies (very dramatic moment) Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drinking blood of one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation the movie skips 9 nine years and most of the friends arent together anymore! Also without a proper reason given Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) have to kill each other! I know that this is done to add some serious drama! Because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced! Apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie! It is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! But it just is! The overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere!',pos
'Theres nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland and Robot Wars does deliver. Sure the acting is lousy the dialogue is sub-par and the characters are one-dimensional but it has giant robots! The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period. They are certainly not as polished as todays standards but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures so it has aged fairly well. Its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime and it does have a certain tongue-in-cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable. I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction.',neg
'Thank G_d it bombed or we might get treated to such delights as Skate Fu where we can see the likes of Brian Boitano performing a triple lutz & slashing bad guys to ribbons with his razor-sharp skates but I digress. One thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little T & A from Ms. Agbayani. Its not like the world would have seen anything new (at least that part of the world who saw her Playboy spread.) I truly believe that porn would have suited her talents much better although Aubrey Hepburn couldnt have stayed afloat in this sewer. One explanation for Kurt Thomas presence could be a traumatic brain injury possibly from coming up short too often on dismounts. Its a good thing the IOC wasnt as diligent on doping as they are now or Kurt would surely have been stripped of his medals. To be avoided at all costs.',neg
'I saw this at the 2004 Stony Brook Film Festival in NY and it was very warmly received. In this pre-WW2 film a pair of German rocket scientists are working on the Scottish Isle of Scarp as war looms on the horizon. The characters encountered on the island are priceless in their creation and their portrayal. Shauna MacDonald is particularly memorable<br /><br />After getting up to speed on the Scootish accents the viewer feel right at home with these folk who watch with amusement as the Germans work to link their isle with the mainland via a rocket-based mail delivery. As implausible as it seems this film was based on an actual story.<br /><br />All in all a memorable film that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting its story or its scenery.',pos
'The trouble with the book Memoirs of a Geisha is that it had Japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an American mans way of thinking. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music sets and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from Japanese ways of thinking were the characters.<br /><br />The movie isnt about Japan or real geisha. It is a story about a few American mens mistaken ideas about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is this movie if it isnt about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes but then why make it into an American fantasy?<br /><br />There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang-ups no connotations of sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. <br /><br />Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? Nope. One character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesnt want to get caught doing something dirty. Such typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha.<br /><br />Did Sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? Nope. She lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. Of course she isnt supposed to enjoy it. And that is what I mean about this movie. Why couldnt they have given her something to enjoy? Why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?<br /><br />Behind Mameha the Chairman was Sayuris secret patron and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. He could have rigged the auction and won her himself. Nobu didnt even bid. So why did the Chairman let that old codger win her and reeking of old-man stink get his fingers all over her naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for that?<br /><br />Lets try to make sense of this. By being behind Mameha the Chairman incurred debts for Sayuris geisha training. In order to recoup his debts the Chairman had Sayuri sold to Dr. Crab. Through Mameha the Chairman sold Sayuris sexual favors to that old geezer so that the Chairman could make some money out of her. The Chairman wasnt her patron. He was her pimp! Some romantic love story.<br /><br />Yes the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive alluring transvestite whose voice appearance and every touch are thrilling. But under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. Under the incorrectly appearing Japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart soul spirit and core of this film is entirely American and male. Not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie distortion and terribly wrong.<br /><br />Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG:<br /><br />Japanese style  Refined elegant simplicity. MOAG style  Peking Opera.<br /><br />Japanese geisha  Hair swept up. MOAG geisha  Loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup.<br /><br />Japanese shaved ice - Japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances. Shaved ice is strictly a summer treat. MOAG shaved ice - The Chairman buys Chiyo the young Sayuri played by the marvelous Suzuka Ohgo this treat during cherry-blossom-viewing season. The thought made my entire body shiver with cold.<br /><br />Japanese geisha  Trained and skilled entertainers. MOAG geisha - sluts.<br /><br />Japanese wind chime - Used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes thanks to the breeze Japanese people feel somehow cooler. MOAG wind chime - a door bell! If a person stood in front of anothers house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic not gain entrance.<br /><br />Japan  Emphasis on human relationships group oriented. MOAG  I want a life thats mine American individualism.<br /><br />Japanese traditional dance  Refined elegance. An almost geometrical and mechanical precision. MOAG dance  Martha Graham freaking out on LSD while wearing a not-very-auspicious white Japanese funeral shroud. Performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha?<br /><br />Japan house fire  Setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community. Fires can rip through those wooden villages towns and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people. MOAG house fire - Great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out-of-control fire miraculously puts itself out. Technically the movie ended here because at the very least Sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again. Which is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled.<br /><br />Enough. The movie stinks.',neg
'I originally saw this on its premiere in the UK. I was mesmerised by it and it had me in tears all throughout its duration. I taped it off the TV for safekeeping but over the years its worn out. And TV never seem to show it. Therefore it was a joy to find out that True Movies own the copyright and were showing it on their channels. This time I taped it onto a DVD so I can enjoy it again and again.<br /><br />Lucile Fray (played magnificently by Ann - Margret) discovers she has cancer and that it is terminal. Her husband has arthritis and although he is loving he is an alcoholic and would be incapable of taking care of their children after she has gone. Therefore she has to find new homes for each of her children before she dies.<br /><br />The acting is top notch the music beautiful and it has stood the test of time wonderfully (it still makes me cry!)

'A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). The story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. The movie has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be? and Is less really more if you are happy? Answering those questions makes the movie. The movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had. Never a dull moment!',pos
'I knew nothing about this film until I watched it... my brother in fact suggested I take a look. Normally his suggestions arent much cop however but I was stuck for something to watch so I watched it.<br /><br />Well to cut a long story short I give it 10/10.<br /><br />The film centers around two people that meet whilst lodging at the same place. One is initially very dependant upon the institution around him the other is a rebel. One does what he likes the other as hes told.<br /><br />From the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building and see how they rub off a little on each other. Its a remarkable piece of work that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist people leaping out of bath tubs or superheros coming to save the day.<br /><br />Theres a fair amount of grit and reality in there not everything can ever go just right - not all gulfs can ever be spanned - and this film delightfully shows the lot.<br /><br />If you watch this film and are not impressed.....

Id say save your money but chances are if you want to see this movie...youre going to anyway. I didnt hate it...its just not very good. Overall its just another bland lifeless horror film that lacks life (its no surprise that this one was on the shelf at Dimension for over a year after it was completed).',neg

'Twenty years after watching this I still find myself quoting things from this movie like Look between the two giant melons or Ill start to sing the Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme. On the other hand 20 years later I can now make sense of the Meat Machine as theres still a lot of the stereotypes like this out there that they used for this movie. Those are signs of a good movie to me. I could say this movie stands the test of time which I cant really say for a lot of 80s movies. I continue that this movie is still on a list of a lot of peoples favorite movie as a kid growing up in the 80s. If you like games and have dreams of becoming a Game Master or find yourself dorking out over these 80s movies to relive your childhood you need to watch this. Also its sometimes sarcastic and funny.

'Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja-growing in order to pay the bills.

Theres actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to Give me one (a toke) and he thinks shes asking for sex and acts all awkward. Yes its humour so twee a nun would be bored. Saving Grace doesnt seem to know what it wants to be: the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of Ryans Daughter whilst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of Antiques Roadshow. It does speed up after the first hour but by then its too clichéd to care. The climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina Ive ever seen.',neg
'Touching and sad movie. Portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident. The film centers on his relationship with his married lover whom he is often very hostile towards and his interactions with other accident victims particularly a black down-and-out and a white-supremacist biker. The film is often humorous often sad and always believable. Get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy Sunday afternoon with your partner.',pos
'This is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant. Gathering 11 prominent international directors and allotting each of them 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; each short exploring the global reverberations of 9/11. Without using any spoilers I would say that Ken Loachs piece is the jewel in the crown and Mira Nairs short (segment India) based on a true story deserves to be made into a full feature film. One also realizes while watching his short why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today  he simply is a master of the medium who has also a profound understanding of the subject matter. Unfortunately not all 11 parts are made as well. Youssef Chahine in his segment Egypt assumes the Arab stance of the self-inflicted collective guilt which piece could have potentially been the most interesting one. He fails miserably. Chahines short is poorly written and badly executed at least enough to stand out amongst other superior chapters of the film. Despite the imbalance in quality I would still give the film 7/10 for concept if not for execution.',pos

'I rented this film from Blockbust because of the Cover and Title! Sounded intriguing!! This movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense. The monsters needed more face time. We needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more Oh Sh-- moments. The photography didnt bother me except for the scene where a re-breather blows up. There were too many close ups. But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom. Overall I would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers. But this movie is definitely a below average rent.<br /><br />There are definitely better picks. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 over this pick.',neg

Sure there are lots of famously bad movies but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously.<br /><br />It is a Romanian-made film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood. It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again.<br /><br />It was released only on video (I cant imagine why) and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVDs had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling.',neg

'I sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of Hitchcocks lesser known films because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden Hitchcock gem or a true Hitchcock great or some other generic if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc. So that being said I would just like to say that if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc.<br /><br />Now that may be overshooting a little bit The Ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above but compared to the other films that Hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s I really think that The Ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them. As an almost brand new director there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why Hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career.<br /><br />Granted the film does start with among other things the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer (and I use idiot in the definitive manner the way Stephen King so often does) having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people. I suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then but I think it is one of the most off-putting sequences in any Hitchcock film Ive seen.<br /><br />The main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round but when he meets his match it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wifes finger. So begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly.<br /><br />(spoilers) There is for example a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and just before going into the building she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss. This kiss is never explained and there is also the fact that even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband or at least ultimately chooses him they look into each others eyes but do not actually kiss.<br /><br />The film is certainly beautifully photographed even more so than several films that Hitch released in subsequent years. There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as One Round Jacks trainer who in his stone faced expressionism reminds me quite often of the brilliant Buster Keaton. Hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous but this is a great sample of his early work.',pos
'Had no idea what I was going to experience viewing this old film from 1940. However I always enjoy viewing Laraine Day (Katie Lattimer) who plays the role as a younger sister to Jean Muir (Helen Lattimer) and also their mother Billie Burke (Mrs. Julia Lattimer). Thought I was going to be bored with the story of two sisters and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet up with Robert Cummings (Ridley Crane) who has the reputation of being a millionaire playboy who has plenty of gals and is a heavy drinker who parties all the time. One night Helen Lattimer goes on a date with Ridley and he proceeds to get bombed out of his mind and simply cannot drive his car. It is at this point in the film when this becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this film which will definitely hold your attention right to the very end of the film.',pos
':Spoilers:<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Loves Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three Love movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing there were way to many goofs and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in the movie just didnt seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all.<br /><br />I think the script writers should have went more by the book. It seems like every movie thats been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Okes writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathys death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.<br /><br />Out of the four movies that have been made so far Id have to say that Loves Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope hes got a bigger part and I hope his part isnt so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.',neg

In fact they are some of the nicest people youll ever meet with some really uncommon way of living and that is what shouldve appeared in the film.<br /><br />The youth are following the religious here because of a reason and that is the youngsters are the most passionate and sentimental. And with the well formed principles the religious live on the youngsters follow them. Again this is what shouldve appeared.<br /><br />We need another First Film with a Saudi Writer actor director composer even cameraman. So that they all work with passion towards their experiment not just for the money!<br /><br />And we should do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago we should include phrases from the Quran in the script of the movie. As the people in our society still see art as a form of sin the challenge a Saudi movie maker is facing is changing the mentality in that angle.',neg
'This movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama about two guys who worked in a Butchers shop and wanted to build up their own. When they finally fulfilled that dream they faced a new problem: there were no clients! One day by accident one guy dies in the refrigerator room and a new kind of butchers business begins They start selling human flesh saying to the clients its just chicken and their business starts to improve: Human flesh sells good! Oh! I forgot to say something These guys arent normal! Theres really something missing in their brains! <br /><br />The movie has some nice dark humour scenes but it is in my opinion mostly a drama. One that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath what are his motivations to what he does. I must confess I was a bit surprised with the ending of the movie because I never expected they could make it without been discovered but thats probably because I see too many Hollywood movies What I mean by this is that in Hollywoods cinema we always expect the punishment of the guys which do the bad things. Theres always a morality protecting the good values in spite of we all know that in real life it doesnt happen this way too many times And I liked this movie mostly because of that because it fits in a kind of cinema which is true frontal without fake moralities and which see what is on the other side behind the conventional morality It just happens in independent cinema (especially in the European)! <br /><br />Besides therere excellent performances by Nikolaj Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen (especially the first one) in the roles of the disturbed guys <br /><br />Very nice Danish film!',pos

'Historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war New Orleans. Starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women because these were free people. They may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors. The young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives whether to give into the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community. I enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were Christophe Anna Bella and Marcel.',pos
'...at least during its first half. If it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes it would have been a much better and tighter film. The second half of the film is worth it especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships but its like a dull toothache getting there. Also dont watch this film just because Ginger Rogers is in it. She has an important role but its a small one.<br /><br />The film starts out showing three New York City buddies working the tourist trade and also in good-natured competition for the hand of Sally (Ginger Rogers) a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue. World War I breaks out the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle yet enlist in the navy anyways. The one of the three with the least industry as a civilian (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) winds up the commanding officer to the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets). To make matters more complex Sally has fallen in love with one of the three but doesnt have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war.<br /><br />The film is a little more interesting on board ship mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable. However James Gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible.<br /><br />One real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design or I should say the lack of it. In the scenes in New York just prior to WWI we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 - no effort was taken to bring this film into period.<br /><br />In conclusion if you watch the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission youve seen everything here worth seeing. The rest is padding.',neg

'this show disturbs me. it takes up slots on nick at nite that could be reserved for the fresh prince or George Lopez. even full house and Roseanne. theyre all better than home improvement. first off the mother Jill annoys me SO much. she is an oversensitive whiny baby and i really despise her. brad is a fat toad and he is annoying too. and the youngest brother i dont even know his name! i dont notice him at all! thats probably not the actors fault though its probably the writers. Tim is just a stupid ass. although Jill is DEFINITELY my least favorite i dont like any of them. the only reason i gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to randy. as the middle child he is still a pesky little brother but an older brother and i like his fun character. the other star goes to Al. as the chubby friend his character is likable. other than randy and Al this show sucks.',neg
'The Van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van in order to seduce them. The only thing this movie doesnt fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the US in the late 70s. It looks like it was totally made by amateurs. Its trash but I loved it! I have to admit I am a fan of 70s trash! Hope this one makes it to the IMDB bottom 100!<br /><br />2',neg
'Hilarious clean light-hearted and quote-worthy. What else can you ask for in a film? This is my all-time number one favorite movie. Ever since I was a little girl Ive dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble.<br /><br />The cliché characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun. The wonderful comedic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) make up most of my favorite parts of the movie. And who didnt love the hopeless awkwardness of Flynch? Dont forget the airport antics of Leons cronies dressed up as Hari Krishnas: dancing chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! The clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless.<br /><br />A word to the wise if you didnt watch this film when you were little it probably wont win a place in your heart today.

Others have said it here already but this guy is a total fake and fraud if you believe any of these cons I think you should seriously consider going to get your head checked because theyre all fake and the ones that might possibly be true are so pointless like spending all day to con someone out of giving you an average meal at a restaurant?

'Well I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasnt it. It plodded along at a pretty slow deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes but there wasnt really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--theres an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Renos character and an old man but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character whom I didnt know much about and couldnt really relate to at the time. He wanders around alone for the most part he doesnt meet anyone; I imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or something which is all good but I still wish hed trimmed it down from 40 minutes to 15 because it can get incredibly boring.<br /><br />But after those 40 minutes things start to get very interesting. I guess I wont really say more than that because I dont want to spoil anything. So if youve seen the first 15-30 minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off (like I was) just stick with it--it gets a lot better.<br /><br />One of the most interesting things I found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever which really made me have to think about what was happening how characters were feeling and what their motivations were why things were how they were in this post-apocalyptic world all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation. And its amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors arent telling you exactly whats going on.',pos
'I was raised in a very Christian household since birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church. This movie was highly disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years. I used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my moms footsteps upstairs. If I didnt hear her footsteps I would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadnt been raptured. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I was terrified of Jesus forgetting me. This is definitely not something I will show to my kids until they are much older if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.',neg
'(Only minor spoilers except as noted).<br /><br />Ive enjoyed a lot of Spanish cinema recently; both the actual Spanish cinema of people like Almodovar and the Latin American cinema of directors like del Toro whose superb Devils Backbone set in Civil War Spain was the finest horror film of the last decade. Its no surprise then that this film is both well-made well-acted and manages to sustain that distinctively different Spanish atmosphere. But its also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see.<br /><br />What actually is the purpose of all this? We have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice-over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal. In a routinely unpleasant opening sequence set more than a decade earlier we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control-freakery (if I cant have you nobody can.). Oddly enough that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree which appears completely different in both motivation and execution. What happened to him in jail to cause this change? We have no idea though we do later discover as an absurd sort of afterthought that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned.<br /><br />In Britain in several of our notorious serial killer or sex killer cases the terrible question arises; what about the wife? Did she know or suspect what was going on? This is a question that this film could have asked and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters. But banally the answer to the question is quite clearly: No she didnt. Even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate the film still manages to bungle it. All we actually get sketched perfunctorily out at the end is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event. Compare this to the awful revelatory moment in Ten Rillington Place where Christies wife says you know what I mean. thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror.<br /><br />(Major spoiler in this paragraph). In the meantime we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again. How exactly did he achieve this? The plot gets extremely sketchy at this point; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police; but how this all works or why or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds remains a mystery.<br /><br />I actually dont believe serial killers are like this. The Silence of the Lambs may be comic book stuff but  Lecter aside  it gets its serial killers right. They are deeply disturbed deeply dysfunctional deeply inadequate people; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here (closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of The Last Horror Movie or indeed even Man Bites Dog though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire).<br /><br />This film has little suspense and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated. It has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers either generally or in the specific cultural milieu of Spain. This is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women. And oddly what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented. The soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory. Just one explicit shot properly timed would have been infinitely more shocking and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation. Instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear. Very very creepy. Im sorry to be rude; I love horror films and can tolerate even the most extreme to the extent even of worrying my partner. But I think anyone who finds this film good or interesting even Id find myself edging away from. The purpose of a horror film is to scare you; this is just lascivious.<br /><br />It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed. I have to give this film more than one star just because its competently executed but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made.',neg
'This is not the video nastie but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in Britain. It is 75\% a rehash of The Boogeyman and would have been banned for the same reason - whatever that was.<br /><br />I was initially confused as I thought that Annie (Kelly Galindo) may have been a different Lacey but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film. Fans will immediately note that they are not the same person.<br /><br />After seeing a murder in a bathroom and also seeing the address as well Annie her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials head to the house and sure enough its the same bathroom. 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described. Of course we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered.<br /><br />Then the movie shift to a rerunning of The Boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original. Notably the boogeyman is shown unlike the original. Sadly some of the good scenes were cut but 90\% of it is there. Why rerun this film? Did they find the footage in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /><br />Well never know and despite the psychologist telling Annie she is cured we all know the bogeyman will never die.',neg
'I suppose JEDI is now chronologically to be considered the very last entry in the popular saga and its a very good one as were several of these. I liked how directly this sequel took off after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character(and also Mark Hamill as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks they werent so bad. I enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods and I felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter. The ending (with some new additions I presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy. I know many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for changes he made to the original films but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didnt already know I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity. Oh and err -- Carrie Fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit.',pos

'STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Old Detroit is back with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continuing to swallow everything in its path as construction of the new Delta City continues and a new menace to contend with in the shape of Cain a cruel drug lord with delusions of Christ-likeness peddling a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke. As he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him the tin plated hero sets out to bring this villain down- only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of scrap metal. With Robocop out of action a ruthless OCP business-woman proposes plans for her new android- a stomping snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it- which Cain fits perfectly. After a brief glitch in his system Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with Cain.<br /><br />The original Robocop is a film that always manages to astound you each time you watch it no matter how many times youve seen it one of those films that just cant be done again. That said its not surprising a sequel was made- its even less surprising that that sequel really pales compared to the original. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kirschner has crafted an unpleasant slightly incoherent and overlong film that cant capture the magic of the first film no matter how hard it tries. And it certainly does that the funny ads from the first film running none stop the corporate satire aiming to be that bit sharper and the action roaring as fast and furious as before but with blood/gore even meaner than the first film. The first film earned a name for some nasty blood-soaked violence (including a mans genitals being blown off and a man being blasted to pieces) but while that was more memorable the violence/gore on display here is of a more sadistic and gratuitous nature with a very unpleasant and mean-spirited tone to it.<br /><br />But overall the film leaves you with a feeling of general apathy- why are you watching this when you could be watching the original again instead? **',neg

'The history of the FBI as told from the point of view of Agent Stewart via flashbacks interwoven with his personal life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good as is Hamilton as an earnest agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. Its like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a whos who cast of gangsters. Some of the episodes are too long some too short and some just look out of place (Stewarts daughters school sequence). Overall it goes on way too long. Nevertheless its worth a look for its handsome production values.',pos
'Its rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created and how bias its product was.<br /><br />I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film-makers to display the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.<br /><br />I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bombers parents and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic in my mind to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.<br /><br />I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother which normally would be admirable in a documentary however in the light of the lack of impartiality it all seems exploitative. Also for the poor edits lack of background in the actual instance and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately it is a poor documentary and a poor film. I acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart-wrenching and sad subject matter.',neg
'Finally watched this shocking movie last night and what a disturbing mindf**ker it is and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes and a total assault on the senses. Looks like a movie from the minds of Lynch (specifically ERASERHEAD) Buttgereit and even a little of Begotten. What this guy does to his pregnant sister is beyond belief but then again did it really happen or is it his brains left and right sides doing battle. Thats the main theme of this piece of art to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasizes overtakes the reasoning and logical left side. And the music in this movie is unbelievable a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. Even though this movie is totally shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard core sex) you will ever see in any movie I viewed it as a work of art and loved it. And that music still amazes me I have to try and find the soundtrack if is available. Watching Subconscious Cruelty is a real event and not something the viewer will easily forget. And a note to gorehounds this is a must-have.<br /><br />Warning... Be careful buying this movie because some prints have fogging on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore especially the copies from the Japanese release.',pos
'I have done some research on Ed Gien and I have found a few interesting things. Like the fact that Ed Gien was quiet and a loner not some buff over bearing jerk as in this movie. I will say that I didnt finish this movie but I will. I will cringe through the fact that all of us Wisconsinites talk like we are from Kentucy. You know the funny but oh so sad factor in this movie is Wisconsin isnt as hot as they made it look.<br /><br />This movie is not only an insult to Wisconsin people being a Wisconsite myself but it is a complete insult to a man that was proved to be an insane lonely man. He killed two people and the movie couldnt even get that right. Ed didnt get that close and personal and scare people he shot the two and only people he killed. So why do these movies lie and say BASED ON A TRUE STORY? This is not based on nothing but the lies the director came up with in his foul head.<br /><br />A joke and nothing more!<br /><br />OK I would like to add on to this. I did finish this oh so sad movie and I personal would like to laugh at the director. Do your homework when making a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no Mountains (for those who have never been in Wisconsin) and oh THERE IS NO DESERT! What the hell there was more pine trees and snow in Ravenous and that was suppose to be shot in Californa. <br /><br />OK for those who know nothing about Ed Gein I would like to give you your history lesson. Ed Gein was thought to have killed his family but it was never proved. He killed a bartender she was shot at bar close when no one was around. He took the DEAD bartender back to his house. 10 years later he SHOT and killed the store clerk he stoled the cash register and the store truck. He was caught because of this murder he came in the day before when her son was there and asked about antifreeze. The day he killed her he was in there buying the antifreeze and the reciept that only had antif..... was the only evidence they had to start a world wide man hunt. He robbed graves in fact in robbed 56 graves. He hate the people he dug up and he made furinture; lamp shades couches chairs and other things. <br /><br />He had a family that he had dinner with once and awhile and they threw all the meat he ever gave them out when he was caught considering he was caught at their house. He was arrested and hid in the back of a cop car in fear of what may happen to him. How do I know all of this? I read the book the judge that tried him wrote. <br /><br />After this movie was over after watching the whole horrific thing not only am I offended by the directors horriable view on what Wisconsin women look like. I mean it was hard to tell who this guy had on the slab half the time you know cause Wisconsin women are all BLONDES. Please! I am overly offended by the lack of homework this guy did and the poor job he did making this movie. I have no idea who this Kane guy is and I think he may be OK in something else but he did a horrible job playing Ed Gein. <br /><br />After all of this I am so sad I wasted the 3.99 on the movie. <br /><br />Movie after finished was completely untrue this movie is like me saying that the world is flat and George Washington wasnt our first president. Come on people that is your history and this is Wisconsins history. To end this rant how would all of you feel if I made a movie and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt (some of you may think that is fine but it would be not true) and he lived and wasnt the president and whatever.

'Aimless teens on summer break in a small Ohio town cant find any meaningful ways to fill their time. Some consider driving to Chicago; others are content to drink and bully their peers. In a random act of alcohol-fueled arrogance the bullies rough up a homeless man and steal a strange book. The handwritten text turns out to contain archaic spells designed to summon demonic forces. A night or two later one of them reads an incantation and is quickly possessed. He turns into a vicious killer and begins to quietly prey on his former peers.<br /><br />Demon Summer is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. The production values are low but the filmmakers were smart enough to not be ambitious. Little in the way of special props or shooting locations were needed. The acting is especially weak and there is virtually nothing original in the screenplay. On the positive side the special makeup effects are surprisingly good by low budget film standards. Despite this the gore is minimal. Makeup effects aside there is little going for this film even for die-hard gore-hounds. Not recommended.',neg

'I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time and it was even more boring than when I first watched it. I dont understand why it has become such a cult classic when it is so tediously dull. The opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life. After this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut. The makeup is quite good and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open. Theres not much to wet yourself over though most scenes are shot in darkness and you cant really see what is happening. There isnt much gore at least in the Vipco DVD I watched. <br /><br />No The Incredible Melting Man is not that great at all. Ill give it marks for its cheese factor but thats about it.

'(Synopsis) In the year 2055 the rich are able to travel back in time and hunt a live dinosaur for a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can take people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) has taken this technology and opened a business know as Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team together with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a spot where they can kill the dinosaur. The trip protocol is that they must stay on the walkway and not disturb the land or anything creature around them. Unfortunately for the human race one hunter steps on and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act causes major impacts to the earths climate and creates new species of animal life. The course of evolution as we know it is now being changed by time waves. Travis and Sonia try to stop the changing process before it becomes permanent and man becomes extinct.<br /><br />(Comment) The movie was a little slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a little overdone. The death of a single butterfly causing the tremendous changes in the worlds atmosphere and evolution is simply ridiculous. They changed the skyline of Chicago to look modern but the new cars of the future were silly looking. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD.

'While it comes no closer to the Tarzan of Edgar Rice Burroughs than say the Johnny Wiesmuller flicks did it does have its own peculiar and entertaining slant on the story. Its a well done Tarzan movie. Nice scenery good photography workable continuity and a Tarzan yell that echos the one described by Burroughs. The players all perform well. The only bad points I found were I think related. It moves slow in places. That slow movement? Makes this picture to long. It could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter which I think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development. But the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick. Short version of all the above ... Its a very GOOD Tarzan movie.',pos
'Im rarely moved to make a comment online about a film. But I cant understand how this one got made. Who made it? How could they have possibly thought they were capable of making a feature film? Did they do a weekend course at some film school get a nice big cheque from daddy and kidnap David Badiels family one by one until he agreed to be in it? Or was he by any chance a longtime family friend/distant relation doing this out of sheer misplaced kindness? I dont care dont want to know. Even he looks utterly embarrassed to be in it mumbling his lines and hiding his face from the camera.

Its not that I mind the stop-motion clay dinosaur its everything else about the movie that bothers me. The acting is atrocious. The dialogue is utterly ridiculous.

Georgia Rule on the other hand was a disorganized weak poorly written unrealistic example of movie making at its worst. by the end of the film I didnt care who was lying or if anything was resolved. <br /><br />The most important thing in a film is a good STORY. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject matter is deep doesnt mean the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change and is primed for that change over the course of the movie. In Georgia Rule the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time (youve only got a couple hours in a movie). That means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the poorly written story and the litter of weak dynamic characters I cant even say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. Thats fine if yourre writing American Beauty but not when youre attempting a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (no Im not cutting her any slack because she was molested crap happens to everyone and were all responsible for our own actions). The Dudley Do Right Mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments...and Simon I mean seriously what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl whos been molested just stay over occasionally (unless hes an actor or a politician). This movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself what good movie making is NOT!',neg
'How anyone can say this is bad is beyond me. I loved this show before I even saw it. For 3 reasons 1. The Story intrigued me 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and Please watch the whole first Season before you decide that its bad because I know that if you watch the first Season you will LOVE it and go out and Buy Season 1 as well as Season 2 on DVD and then Join the campaign to get Season 3 Made!<br /><br />I Hate Fox and Im sure a lot of you Dark Angel fans hate them too. They have a thing for Canning Good Shows! Dont you all agree?',pos
'The reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist Robert James Waller also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A failing couplea blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong self-directed criminal and after a few adventures (mostly terrifically violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin she leaves the impotent partner for the killer who bad as he is sees her more clearly than anyone has before. Nothing can help this movie succeed not even the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer not the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A serious waste of time.',neg
'I read the book a long time back and dont specifically remember the plot but do remember that I enjoyed it. Since Im home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and Hey !! It is a Lifetime movie.<br /><br />The movie is populated with grade B actors and actresses.<br /><br />The female cast is right out of Desperate Housewives. Ive never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and I get the gist. Is there nothing original anymore? Sure but not on Lifetime.<br /><br />The male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands I suppose.<br /><br />In one scene a female is struggling with a male for her life and what does she do??? Kicks him in the testicles. What else? Women love that but let me tell you girls something... Its not as easy as its always made to look.<br /><br />It wasnt all bad. I did get the chills a time or two so I have to credit someone with that.',neg

'This movie travels farther on 8 gunshots 2 kisses and 100 clichés than should be possible. Yet it still works. Brilliant.<br /><br />As I was driving home from the theater I tried to figure out how it got away with movie staples like the pages of a novel manuscript blowing across a beach or the impossible series of fortuitous coincidences without the entire audience standing up and screaming Ive seen that a million times before! And youve pushed beyond the edge of believability! But the actors were so enchanting and the screen so filled with believable extras that I forgot to care. A friend who saw it with me said it transported him to Paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized we were still in Indiana.<br /><br />Overall a romantic-comedy-thriller with subtlety wit and elan.',pos
'I dont know if it was the directors intent to make sure the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film. Perhaps that is the romantic image many Americans have of the time this film is set as it is in the middle of the War Macy has returned from the war (His neighbor asks Hey is it true you got a Fritz over there?) and is trying to get on with his life but one day he gets a new pair of glasses (hence the name) and sees things clearly as the surrounding situation reveals itself to be one of rabid anti-semitism and Macy and Dern could wrapped up in it. Funny how neither is Jewish in this film but the accusation is made. Also it is historically accurate as the labor union Democrats of this time wrapped themselves in the flags of America and God. Macy is continually pestered to come to the meeting. His presence brings unexpected results.<br /><br />Applying this time frame to today is a study in contrast. In 2005 has undergone a complete reversal with average citizens who have taken patriotism and religion as their unifier supporting the Republican Party and viewing organized labor as part of left-wing unpatriotic America.<br /><br />A great picture to watch if you care to see the friendly timid and meek Macy (played beautifully by him) get caught in the carnage of race and hate in the mid 40s in NYC.<br /><br />A tough emotionally charged film.',pos
'For late-80s cheese this really isnt so bad. There are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one-liners (That was grand theft! - Thanks!) and Madonna gives a fine performance; nothing award-worthy here but that goes for Razzies as well as Oscars. Im curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular (pre-British influenced) speaking voice rather than the hyper-Bronxy accent used instead. Oh well. As a side note I got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work; he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck the UPS delivery guy died about a year after Whos That Girl',pos
'Opening credits: great. Music: just right for this film. Cinematography: sleazy to great effect.<br /><br />Harrowing excitement in a train-wreck sort of way. This is how out of control some lives can become. Wonderland depicts drug-induced wildness (and its consequences) not as an aberration but shows how it really does happen in our society. It is better than depictions of another wild group -Mansons- because all Manson films books etc concentrate so much on Mansons insane mind rather than the overall picture of the cheap fame and randomness that is so pervasive nowadays.<br /><br />If you want to see some of the best Method-acting on film watch Kilmer in this movie. He shows how The Method can be riveting in the right role.<br /><br />The filmmakers here succeed in raising out-of-control to the level of an art form not just for the sake of giving us cheap thrills.',pos
'From the opening shot of the meteor falling towards Earth you know youre in for something special.<br /><br />This is an ultra-low budget shot on video movie about a group of teens stranded on a lighthouse island with some monsters. The story is unremarkable and nothing you havent seen a thousand times before. The acting isnt great but isnt completely horrible however the special effects - of which there are a good deal - are laughable at best. In fact if you can read this sentence chances are better than 50\% that you could do a more credible job creating the video explosion and compositing effects in this movie than the filmmakers.<br /><br />The movies saving grace - if youre in the mood for a grade Z turkey of a film - is that theres always something happening and it never gets boring. And if you like making fun of bad movies with your friends you might just find this worth a dollar rental.<br /><br />And I must say I appreciated the opening joke that is the dumbest name for an island Ive ever heard. Probably the best moment in the movie.',neg

Youd never know by watching it though. Script? Are you kidding. Acting? I think even the trees were faking. Cinematography? Well there mustve been a camera there. Period.

'The 1930s. Classy elegant Adele (marvelously played with dignified resolve by Debbie Reynolds) and batty frumpy Helen (the magnificent Shelley Winters going full-tilt wacko with her customary histrionic panache) are the mothers of two killers.

Adele begins dating dashing millionaire Lincoln Palmer (the always fine Dennis Weaver). On the other hand religious fanatic Helen soon sinks into despair and madness.<br /><br />Director Curtis (Night Tide Ruby) Harrington working from a crafty script by Henry Farrell (who wrote the book Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? was based on and co-wrote the screenplay for Hush ... Hush Sweet Charlotte) adeptly concocts a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt fear repression and religious fervor running dangerously amok. The super cast have a ball with their colorful roles: Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous elocution teacher Agnes Moorehead as a stern fire-and-brimstone radio evangelist Yvette Vickers as a snippy overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star Logan Ramsey as a snoopy detective and Timothy Carey as a creepy bum. An elaborate talent recital set piece with Pamelyn Ferdin (the voice of Lucy in the Peanuts TV cartoon specials) serving as emcee and original Friday the 13th victim Robbi Morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead-on Mae West impression qualifies as a definite highlight.

After watching it I was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish then I looked at the other stuff hes done to see if this was his first or second movie but no he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one.<br /><br />The story was pretty awful too could someone just fall in love with a girl because shes pretty but has the mind of a child?

'I have never seen American Werewolf in London but this movie was very entertaining. When renting it I thought it was a horror movie but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some horror aspects. I thought the transformation sequences were nicely done but effects wise the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting built off each other nice. The transformations reminded me a lot of werewolf transformations in other movies but the werewolves themselves are very beastly and not very dog like.

'This is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders. The storyline centres on a deranged man who lives in Texas US who suddenly goes on a killing spree with his two young sons after being instructed by God to redeem the world of bad people.<br /><br />Bill Paxton who directs this movie plays the deranged Father who is known as the Hand of God Killer while Matthew McConaughey plays his finest performances to date as the oldest son Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton who decides he can no longer hold the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to hauntingly tell the story to FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe).<br /><br />I cannot think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from start to finish and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching you wont be able to because of the sheer power of this movie.<br /><br />The directors have filmed this movie very well and they help to set the plot through the good scenery. The acting in this movie is great but if there is any drawback it is that some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people.<br /><br />Whilst the concept of this film is very dark the young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting. This really is a spine tingly movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different.<br /><br />8/10',pos
'2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama which has some similarities in tone and subject with films like Bully Elephant and Kids (although by my point of view 2:37 is a superior film to those three ones).Before watching this movie my expectations were neutral but I ended up taking a very good impression thanks to the intelligent screenplay Murali K. Thalluris perfect direction and the excellent performances from a group of young actors.<br /><br />The sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many movies TV programmes and books which pretend to find and predict the external or internal reasons of those unbridled expressions of rebelliousness discontent...and specially madness.Some people may say that 2:37 arrives too late to that artistic movement; however I do not think like that because that delay permitted the movie to make a more artistic analysis focusing on the situation with more subtleness and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish which impregnated other movies with similar stories.<br /><br />On the characters from 2:37 we can find clichés from the juvenile cinema (from director and screenwriter John Hughes -RIP-s movies to the teen horror films): the beautiful princess the clumsy nerd the antipathetic athletes etc.It would have been very easy to make them become in hollow caricatures defined by their function in the screenplay; but it is something admirable that the screenplay transcends the stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems which in more or less degree any person can find on his/her road to maturity.<br /><br />2:37 is an excellent movie whose only fail is that the ending feels a bit affected but which compensates that with a lot of positive elements.It will be very interesting to see Thalluris next projects since he has had a great debut with this movie.',pos
'The complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. I am okay with these night time soaps like Greys Anatomy or Ugly Betty or West Wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. However when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (Taye Diggs Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital it seems like General Hospital...or a female counterpart to Baywatch. That was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.',neg

'Lets face it there is no perfect production of Hamlet its simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeares abstruse dialogue. In any staging of it there are bound to be certain moments scenes or intonations that one disagrees with. Ive seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier Gibson Branagh Scott and now this BBC film with Jacobi. In terms of faithful full-length productions this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours. This production appears to be complete -- that is ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- and so its essential for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers. And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text) for the most part the script is well-acted well-spoken and well-performed. Subtitles are available and very helpful although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />Jacobi does a quite admirable job with theatres longest and most impossible role. I actually cried when Hamlet dies and I dont think Ive done that before. Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes) and the rest of the very on-point cast. Sets are minimal so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes this full-length Hamlet is a long haul to sit through but again if you want the real deal its 100\% worth it even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself. I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.',pos
'The movie is about two stories: one is a political murder of a call-girl the other an upper-class political party. The crossing point is the public relation character played by Al Paccino as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening.<br /><br />If the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama the performance of Al is memorable: how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man (as The Godfather) as here as a little servant (see also Donnie Brasco).<br /><br />Actually the big young lion has become a tired old one. This passing of ages is very moving because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too.<br /><br />But his slowness is only a make-up because he can get back his energy in Church scene.<br /><br />Maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on Als talent!',neg

Arthur Penn director of Bonnie and Clyde and Little Big Man saw that Steve Tesichs outstanding script rang with truth and from these two talents comes solid cinema.

'If you are looking for a modern film version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismullers overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous white safari guides or cunning black tribesmen while saving the animal kingdom this is NOT the movie for you. This is a recounting of the Tarzan legend from its beginning in intelligent adult terms. It is beautifully filmed and faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories.<br /><br />Tarzan is no action hero but a man torn between two worlds - the natural and the civilized. In a stunning performance Christopher Lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism. If he slips up just once the cat will be out of the bag: the audience (especially the adult audience targeted by the film) will laugh and the film will completely lose its grip. It will plummet into the cheesy depths. But Lambert never lets that happen. (Forget what you may think of him in other movies; when I saw this film at the theater on its original release I thought he deserved an academy award.)<br /><br />The supporting cast is uniformly excellent as other commentators have noted. I disagree with most of them in that I didnt find anything wrong with Andie McDowells performance. I wouldnt have nominated her for an academy award - the role is undemanding - but she is completely up to it such as it is. I dont know why her voice was overdubbed either.<br /><br />The cinematography of the African segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful. It captures both the beauty of the African wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The scenery is lush and exotic and the colors are vivid.<br /><br />But this is also a period film and the cinematography also magnificently depicts Victorian England - the countryside the city and the interiors. The costumes are outstanding. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or obtrusive.<br /><br />There are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more disturbing than a few scenes in Dances with Wolves. This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature personified in the young Lord Greystoke convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.',pos

'First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired. However it wasnt the Preston Sturges it was Preston Sturges Jr. The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevensons short story The Bottle Imp. A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell. Thats fine. Nobody said screenwriters had to be original. The actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the ending. The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end. There is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think. You can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end. In fact I think its preferable.',neg
'I have never seen any of Spike Lees prior films as their trailers never caught my interest. I have seen and admire Denzel Washington and Jodie Fosters work and have several of their DVDs. I was however entirely disappointed with this movie. If this film is any indication of Spike Lees ability as a director my advice would be to get a job and stop wasting the time and talent of others. <br /><br />I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators watched the same movie that Id seen. I can only assume from their sappy lovelorn reviews that their adoration of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work. I only paid $2.50 in a Second Run theater and still felt Id wasted my money.<br /><br />The IMDb Trivia page says it all.......<br /><br />* Shot in 39 days -- How can you expect to shoot a big budget Blockbuster (as the media hype promised) in such a short time? No wonder there was such a weak performance by all.<br /><br />* Ron Howard was first going to direct the film... -- He may have done this project some justice given more time to do so of course. Though the writing was atrocious the premise had some merits. <br /><br />OK! maybe not. Im sorry! This film was so rife with pitiful clichés implausible scenes and lousy characterizations that maybe even he couldnt have made much of it. (Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell...Good call!) <br /><br />* Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks. -- And it showed! Her portrayal of a Fixer who makes peoples problems go away was as unbelievable as the script she was given. Did she even want to be there?<br /><br />Other Peeves: <br /><br />* How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank and hed better keep away...or else? <br /><br />* When Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet how many bank robbers without a gun would have led a cop (much less let a cop) back out to the front door allowing the police officer to walk behind him? <br /><br />* Det. Frazier later claimed to have given the robber every reason to shoot me. Why then in their brief struggle didnt he even try to expose the robbers face? That may have gotten the response he was looking for...a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification. And why did it take Steve Stevie Steve-O (the robbers accomplice) so long to come and help out? <br /><br />* I understand that these werent your typical bank robbers. They had a different agenda and didnt want anyone harmed. But the cops had no reason to think that they wouldnt. To them it was a desperate situation. Why then when two of the bad guys stepped outside to pick up the pizzas? were they not taken down. (first of all how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield? Is this Spike Lees version of NY City or SNLs?). Taking them down would have reduced the bad guys numbers screwed up their plans and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up. If not there at least would be fewer bad guys inside. (Give SWAT something to do or send them home!)<br /><br />* What police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to just waltz right into the bank and discuss a matter with the robbers that she would not disclose to them first? She had no authority no governmental credentials; and besides this was after all already a hostage situation...add one more?<br /><br />* Why wouldnt the Bank CEO (Christopher Plummer) just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds he could have sold.<br /><br />* Who was that schmuck (the character not the actor) with the Jersey accent that conveniently volunteered and said he knew the recording was 100\% Albanian but yet he himself couldnt speak it.....SIR! PUT YOUR HAND DOWN! And his Ex-wife! What a schlump she was!!! Both were totally unbelievable. <br /><br />* When interrogating suspects why did Det. Frazier continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist? (i.e. - telling the elderly woman she could go and then she couldnt then could; then couldnt?) Give me a break! <br /><br />* Who after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites couldnt deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages? <br /><br />* Near the end of the movie a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room behind which Clive Owens hid out for a week....where did the materials come from? (the drywall & studs). It was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer so he could relieve himself. The bank employees hadnt complained about the smell all week long? Hello!<br /><br />* After such a debacle; since the documents had fallen into the robbers hands what kind of references was Ms. White expecting to get from the bank CEO seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail due to her failure?<br /><br />* And last but certainly not least Whats with the Electric Glide that Denzel did? HOW STUPID! Was that supposed to indicate his resolve to bring these guys to justice? He looked rather like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart while trying to prevent a bowel movement! Cheeee-Zheeee!!!! <br /><br />Other than the mediocre plot; lousy script; bad acting; and overall pitiful directing......yada yada yada. <br /><br />Hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not!<br /><br />.',neg

Maybe because Im from a different era and a different country but I found Crosbys continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first trite after a while and then finally annoying. Dont get me wrong - Im not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave oh so smart American visitor to show them the way. Its a fish out of water story but unlike most movies of this sort this time its the fish who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.<br /><br />(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperors Waltz - and that too produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for whats its worth is American - found the in your face attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt as she put it.) <br /><br />As for the premise of the movie its unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges).<br /><br />All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because he is in virtually every shot its pretty hard to sit through this movie.',neg
'Ronald Colman plays a famous Broadway actor who has begun to lose his mind and sense of identity. After years of playing a wide range of parts he cant remember who he exactly is--who are his roles and who is the self. And much more serious he begins to see and hear his play even in regular everyday life. So since hes currently playing in Othello he begins to act jealous and suspicious--just like the title character. Ultimately it leads him to the depths of insanity and murder.<br /><br />I saw this film years ago and liked it. I just saw it again and loved it. Now perhaps some of my enthusiasm is because I have always liked Ronald Colman and this is a great triumph for him--and for which he earned the Best Actor Oscar. And looking at the competition that year (Gregory Peck for GENTLEMANS AGREEMENT John Garfield for BODY AND SOUL William Powell for LIFE WITH FATHER and Michael Redgrave for MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA) I think Colman was a very good choice as he stretched from his usual comfort zone and did a much more demanding role.<br /><br />Now I noticed that one reviewer hated this film because they hated Shakespeare--and this took up about half their review talking about their dislike for him. However this film isnt really about Shakespeare and it doesnt matter at all if you dislike Shakespeare. I am no huge fan of Shakespeare but marveled at the small portions of the play that Colman re-enacted--though as I said this is NOT a really movie about Shakespeare. Instead its a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind and mixing his stage role with reality. It could have been ANY play though Othello was an excellent choice because of the murder scene--which gets acted out for real later in the film.<br /><br />Overall a very clever film due to a lovely script--with some overtones of Film Noir. Fortunately the acting was terrific also as Colman had excellent support from Signe Hasso Shelly Winters and Edmond OBrien (who was particularly good--he played his part just right). And considering the great George Cukor was directing its no wonder its a wonderful film from start to finish.',pos
'Aside from Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry) an appearance by Henny Youngman and the last seconds of the movie there really wasnt anything particularly good about this film. Why it is currently rated 5.3 and adored by some reviewers is beyond me--the film is 99.44\% crap...and exactly what I would have expected from director Hershell Gordon Lewis. In the 1960s and 70s Lewis was known for making a string of incredibly low budget exploitation films such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER A GO-GO. However in recent years hes been christened the father of gore and he has many many fans--fans who ignore the ineptitude of his work and only focus on how groundbreaking some of his films were. But apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts at heart his films are pure crap--and dont believe scores of 9 and 10 for his films. This would be like putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre!!<br /><br />The film is about a string of very grisly murders that happen to strippers. When I say gruesome its very bloody and sick for 1972--though by todays standards the special effects look amazingly lame. So while some very deviant and cruel murders happen in the film (Id rather not explain them--they ARE from a pretty sick mind and show a particularly sick disregard for women) at least they wont nauseate you because they were done so poorly. Its obvious that in many cases they are cutting apart rubber dolls and mannequins. But to have them doing some of the sick acts even if unrealistic is pretty nasty and shows a lot of misogyny.<br /><br />The only hope in the film as the police are all idiots is a guy named Abraham Gentry--whose mannerisms and style of speech are very close to the stock actor David Lochary from the early John Waters films. While his acting is bad he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest. He could be pretty funny and oddly this is the only film he ever made!! It was also odd that so many women wanted him--especially because they just didnt seem like his type.<br /><br />As for the rest of the folks in the film they are cretins and idiots who could not act. In fact I was kind of hoping MORE would be killed--they really had it coming! None of their acting was the least bit believable and apparently the director NEVER re-shot a single scene--as most of the scenes in the film were worse than any of the ones in Ed Woods masterpiece PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. In fact for many of the women in the film the only prerequisite for their appearing in the film is that they be willing to take off their clothes. Now I know this will sound pretty mean but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug addicts who strip to get their next fix. When these ladies take off their clothes men in the crowd give them money to put it back on (wow--Henny Youngman SHOULD have said that in the film)! But considering Lewis budgets these were probably the best actresses he could get.<br /><br />Overall a sleazy bucket of bile that manages to be worse than most of the directors other films...and thats saying a lot! Its violent (yet dumb) anti-women (treating them like meat and things to be mutilated) and is thoroughly incompetent from start to finish.',neg
'I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan on watching it again with the directors commentary and then again in chronological order.<br /><br />I rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolans more recent movie Memento. Following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar.<br /><br />Shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget. I look forward to his next release Insomnia a big budget movie with my favourite actor Al Pacino.',pos
'This is a fair movie good for one-off viewing. The plot itself is fairly well worked for a picture of this kind which is a pleasent surprise as is the acting which although a little hammy is better than normal for these types of flick.<br /><br />The special effects are hilarious - a translucent giant and a blatantly polystyrene/papier mache hand wobbling unconvincingly on a bit of wire.<br /><br />Definitely to watch once for kitsch entertainment value.<br /><br />5/10.',neg
'Robert Taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun-slinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western. It was one of the few times that Taylor would play a heavy in a film. Nonetheless this picture was far from great as shortly after this Taylor fled to television with the successful series The Detectives.<br /><br />Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned in a formidable performance as Taylors partner. <br /><br />Taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the Indians really shows.<br /><br />Another very good performance here was by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an aged drinking old-timer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well. In his early scenes Nolan was really doing an excellent take-off of Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in 1948. Note the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film. The following year Tamblyn and Nolan would join in the phenomenal Peyton Place.<br /><br />The writing in the film is stiff at best. By the films end its the elements of nature that did Taylor in. How about the elements of the writing here?',neg
'I decided to watch this one because its been nominated for Oscar this year. I guess as many folks here I really wanted to like this movie but ended up bored and disappointed. First scene was OK but the whole rest of the movie in shaky hands camera mode is really annoying.<br /><br />i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this:<br /><br />American military machine (people who makes money on war) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq by bungling up something (sort of) patriotic.<br /><br />why these heroic efforts of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of loving-war-like-a-drug?..

'Beginning where it left off Doctor Who Rose her alternative dad Mickey his alternative counterpart Ricky and Mickeys small gang of rebels find themselves at the mercy of this realities version of the Cybermen this second part of the 2 episode Cybermen arc feels more like a Doctor Who episode as opposed to the previous part which honestly felt like more of an episode of the defunct show Sliders which granted was a great show in its own right. The arc as a whole was enjoyable enough as Im one to subscribe to the maxim that ANY Who is good Who but at the same time its inevitable that this will be compared to the Dalek episode of the previous series. And said comparisons would only make this seem like a lesser work as it is. I just feel that this story couldve been done in one episode. Remember in the first part of the review I said that these type of stories dealing with alternative realities usually have no lasting repercussions well thats not the case here but what changes overall feels tagged on and not really in keeping with the character.<br /><br />My Grade: C+',pos
'It was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh innovative and original show. This makes every show Ive ever watched look plain boring. The moment the first episode aired I was entranced and I became attached to all the characters so easy (which usually never happens because I always hate a few characters). It is a pity this show wont have a third season because it has to be one of the best shows I have ever seen and that isnt exaggerating my feelings for the show at all. Nothing can ever replace Pushing Daisies because what could ABC possibly find to replace this show? This is easily the best show on television. <br /><br />I came for Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with the entire show.',pos
'I use Princess Raccoon (to give the film its not-quite accurate English title) as a litmus test for my friends sense of humour. It either leaves them cold and baffled - as it clearly did several other commentators on this site - or results in doubled-up laughter unassailably huge grins and occasional gasps of admiration.<br /><br />The laughter comes from the films consummate mixture of parodies in contemporary style. Targets include a bouquet of Japanese and Western classical stage drama forms from Kabuki to Late Shakespearian and Spanish renaissance Christian fantasy; the naff vacuity of the modern American and European musical as witness a host of random tap- and rap- dance songs and some very funny banal lyrics all choreographed with loving amateur cliché; Japanese anime and samurai live-action clichés; portentous Buddhist ritual; and the overweening sweetness of Viennese operetta. Ive not laughed out loud so much at this type of film since Ken Russells outrageous musical deconstruction in The Boyfriend.<br /><br />The grins come from the clever textual subversion of the Japanese legend told in a traditional 5-act structure reminiscent of the plays of the 17th century master Chikamatsu. As in his work the narrative is advanced in a mixture of song recitative high-flown poetry and low comedy relief - here the pot-broiling of the incompetent ninja Ostrich by peasants under the illusion that he is a tanuki-raccoon in human guise. All of this somehow does hang together and even more remarkably does manage to engage the watchers emotions through the welter of cultural references.<br /><br />In truth Princess Raccoon wears its pan-cultural garb with alluring lightness and thats where the gasps of astonishment come in. Visually - again as with Russells masterpiece - the film is a treat a riot of colour with its digitised backdrops of classical Japanese images from screens and prints over-the-top costumes and stage sets mixed with some breathtaking live action sequences in summer fields and seashores. Youll love it or loathe it but theres no point castigating chalk for being cheese; and Princess Raccoon stands first and foremost as a wickedly funny as well as affectionate put-down of our contemporary cultural vacuity in both East and West. Bravo!',pos
'Terry and June was one of the classic British sitcoms in my opinion. You knew what to expect - and aint that just so typical! :) Unlike modern sitcoms with utterly contrived plots this show is still a breath of fresh air. How lovely not see or hear remarks about bodily functions or not to see a family PERPETUALLY late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers. And therein is the secret: Terry & June was based on a middle class couple living in relative harmony in stead of todays strained plots with the de rigueur dysfunctional family (made to look hip).<br /><br />Personally I vote the Bridge to far episode as one of the best. In a way Terrys antics reminds me of Basil Fawlty - both sometimes getting almost impossibly embarrassing!<br /><br />Terry & June comes highly recommended. Have your tea and biscuits ready!',pos
'Lizzie Bordens Love Crimes is an important film dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and including full frontal female nudity which sure beats the male kind). It flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory.<br /><br />This treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky but Borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust.<br /><br />One striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses when the antagonist a counterfeit fashion photographer is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse. He shoves a riding crop between her legs pressing it against her crotch and this greatly increases her excitement.<br /><br />Then suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door.<br /><br />Patrick Bergin plays the con artist and though he falls a long distance from handsome he picks on plain Janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line. By all reports Sean Young proves a weird person and she is scarcely beautiful. Yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated hips and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination. Her performance is forceful and complex.<br /><br />Borden possesses an intriguing worldview and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist I truly appreciate.',pos
'Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon. Throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and youd find yourself with almost an exact replica of this film.<br /><br />I remember seeing this when I was younger; I made my Mother rent it from the video shop about 5 times.

'(spoilers)The one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of British cuisine is Steiners henna rinse one of the worst dye jobs ever. That and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal Steiners invention. MST3K does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny.I particularly like it when Crow kills Mike with his touch of death and when he revives him in the theatre Mike cries Guys I died I saw eternal truth and beauty! oh its this movie... That would be a letdown having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of The Projected Man. The film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide. Some of the puns in the film were wicked: police inspector-electrocution! Crow-Shocking isnt it? police inspector-Thats LOwe all right Tom Servo-Very low right down by the floor! police inspector-Can I get on? Tom Servo-Hes dead but knock yourself out MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer.',neg
'This is one really bad movie. Ive racked my brain and I cannot come up with one positive comment to make. The acting is atrocious. Ive seen more believable performances on cable access. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds secret recordings of the President and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst. Night of the Sharks isnt even so bad its good. The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before its filmed. And to top it off Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack Ive ever heard. Im surprised my ears didnt start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record.<br /><br />From everything Ive read the Italian film industry was dead by 1987. Night of the Sharks is like a final nail in the coffin.',neg
'This film is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would for adults. The idea of a childs drawings becoming a place she can physically visit and have influence over is wonderful. At the same time you could get all child psychologist about it and say shes really exploring her subconscious just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. The bit that gives me goose-pimples is when her Dad is in the paper house and chases her. The only thing I cant stand is that it was marketed as a horror film...it really isnt. If you want to see something British with plenty of storyline which keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills most films have to use then watch Paperhouse.',pos
'The Mother is a weird low-budget movie touching at least two uncomfortable themes not usually explored in the cinema: denial of love of mother for their own son and daughter and lust and passion in the third age.<br /><br />The characters are awful: May is a disgusting old lady and I believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sorrow for her. She confesses that she did not love her son and her daughter. She cheated her husband twice with an intellectual. She steals the beloved man of her daughter not to protect her from a guy without moral that does not love her but just because she feel horny with him. She is trying to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way destroying her daughter delusions. Paula her daughter is a fragile loser who accepts her life the way it is. Her brother Bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife who insists in having her shop a terrible business indeed. Darren is an amoral addicted jerk who does not like anybody even himself.<br /><br />The acting and direction are excellent: the actresses and actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very precise. I liked this movie but I recognize that it is recommended for very specific audiences. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Recomeçar (Re-Start)',pos
'Director Lesley Selanders thoroughly routine outdoor yarn The Yellow Tomahawk (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.<br /><br />The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of Black Spurs) eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of The Good The Bad and the Ugly) who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant Major Ives (Warner Anderson of Objective Burma!)about the impending Indian attack Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine Kate Bolden (Peggy Castle of I Jury) is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes too perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally Major Ives dismisses Adams warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim 82-minute oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack knock out of hero and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of Stalag 17) brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery Jr. plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of West Side Story) and Robert Bray of Lassie fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. <br /><br />The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab Utah is that the evil cavalry officer Ives who slaughtered Indian men women and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American too! Ironically the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. The Yellow Tomahawk concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost Fort Ellis where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to Casablanca scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately The Yellow Tomahawk is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of Broken Arrow (1950) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. Actually Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called War Paint (1953) with Robert Stack. Incidentally Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to become regulars on The Rockford Files.',neg

So in theory with a third great film it wouldve been a great trilogy... now its not!<br /><br />Such a huge disappointment Beyond Thunderdome was! Its main premise is pretty cool with an underworld (think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine) but it all isnt carried out with too much conviction. Add the obnoxious Tina Turner and the no good story-line of the people waiting for a plane and this is just one huge stinker.<br /><br />Maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 (although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budget-explosion kinda thing) because this just isnt right.<br /><br />3/10.',neg
'STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs <br /><br />Stuck-up career bitch Kate (Franka Potente) heads to the London underground to catch a train to take her to meet George Clooney. However after a hectic working day she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform. As she races off on a situation taking her from one daunting encounter to the next however she learns of something far more malign and evil waiting for her out there.<br /><br />In a lot of ways the British Film Industry is really becoming one on its own especially in the horror thriller department with films such as Creep and the successful 28 Days Later (which this has strong echoes of in parts.) In terms of succeeding in what it set out to do Creep does cleverly create (especially at the beginning) a scary sense of isolation and tense fear. At its clever running time it also (though inadvertently I suspect) manages to pay homage to some of those pioneer high-concept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear through-out without really focusing too much on character development and such.<br /><br />Of its weaknesses some scenes are a little predictable but these dont really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way. Im not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and its not exactly perfect but its certainly very effective and serves its basic function very well. ***',pos
'This movie is more like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies he feels like making music and when he is making music he feels like making movies. The best thing in Promise me this is the music written by Stribor Kusturica.<br /><br />Kusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise. Promise me this has very little noise.<br /><br />I liked Life is a miracle. It was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful plot. Promise me this has no plot. I was awaiting this movie with big expectations because Ive read that the script has been written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favourite scriptwriters who participated also in Life is a miracle. Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues but for Kusturica they are noise and much to my regret I saw only two dialogues which I could identify as written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor.<br /><br />Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the scripts for Time of the gypsies and Black cat white cat) said in an interview that Kusturica never follows the script. Black cat white cat was the only script for which Kusturica said that he will not touch it. According to Gordan Mihic after all Kusturica comes back to the script and if he doesnt he doesnt make a good movie. And I think this is the case with Promise me this. He should have followed the script of Ranko Bozic.<br /><br />Promise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few moments which made me laugh. The comedic moments are in the same style as Black cat white cat but are not that funny at all. I think the difference comes from the fact that Black cat white cat was written by Gordan Mihic.<br /><br />However I know some people who liked Promise me this they find it very positive movie.',neg
'To be as honest as I possibly can The Devils Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters or) is a complete bore. The movie has a good premise behind it  the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black  but the execution is horrible. There are great long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens. Characters just stand around with nothing to do. Theres no mystery no suspense and no plot points to care about. The acting is simply abysmal. Most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera. They do this repeatedly. And what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing. While its not as bad or pointless as the dancing or the plot in something like Orgy of the Dead it comes close.',neg

Ive never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi.

In all I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves.

'I just saw the third week of Stephen Kings Nightmares and Dreamscapes mini series; meaning I saw 6 episodes so far. I have to say that the stories are really weak. I have read Stephen Kings Skeleton Crew a collection of his short stories that was published way back. I recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent if not outstanding.<br /><br />What Im trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from Stephen King does not mean that it will be any good. In fact if his previous collection of short stories are of any indication then most of this mini series will be average to poor.<br /><br />In Stephen Kings defense I have not read these new short stories. Perhaps they are good as stories in a book and not readily adaptable to television or perhaps it was the fault of the scriptwriters in trying to write an interesting script. Who knows. Also these short stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not not for print purpose. Maybe that may have been the problem. If Stephen King had submitted these crap stories to an editor I am sure the editor would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because as is it is simply boring.<br /><br />What is clear from all of this is that the problem is with the stories/script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it.<br /><br />Seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old Twilight Zone series. Each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and riveting. I dont understand why this mini series could not accomplish similar feat. I am sure this mini series had a good deal of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately something must not have clicked.<br /><br />For instance this week there were two episodes shown. The first involved a horror story writer who buys a picture drawn by an artist who committed suicide. The writer begins to see changes in the picture as he is driving homeward. Feeling uncomfortable he throws away the painting but it keeps appearing near him. Also the portrait of an individual in that picture is killing people and is out to kill him. (I will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and their loot because it was even more boring than this episode!)<br /><br />This premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it I was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story as well as extraneous materials that was shown that did nothing to help the story. After the last scene I was left with more questions than answers.<br /><br />I tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too aggravating due to poor stories/script. If this was a movie I would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such. I would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store. However given that this is on TNT a cable channel I would say if you have not seen it already then try it for one week. If you do not like it that week then you will not like the past series nor the future ones since they all share the same boring trait.',neg
'Gave it two stars because the DVD cover was good enough to make me buy this piece of horse manure. I paid a dollar for it at the local DVD exchange and I want my money back. I have a couple of good movies(at least I think theyre good) that have never seen the inside of a video store. After seeing this Im really insulted by that. Light years worse than anything Ive ever seen I cant even recommend this as a campy joke movie. It is so bad instead of making you laugh it makes you angry. How did this awful film find any kind of distro? I can only believe it was self distributed as the amateurish DVD authoring would suggest. To the producers of this movie get out of the business its obvious you have no talent for it.',neg
'Wild Rebels was probably a fun second film at a drive in movie triple feature 40 years ago. It hasnt aged very well but it was never meant to age well; it was obviously intended to be disposable forgettable fun from its inception. Taken on that level its a good example of the biker flick genre.<br /><br />Several elements help distinguish it from the dozens of similar films being churned out at the same time. The hero Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo) comes off as somewhat of an unimpressive Everyman - hes not especially brave tough talented or handsome (although he does win a fight with a tough biker gang member halfway into the film and the girl gang member chooses to help him over her fellow gang member at the end of the film). The soundtrack is quite well done featuring a nice Ventures style bass/drum riff that keeps things moving and saxophones and brass charts that pep things up quite a bit. And although the script is pretty shallow all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with a fair amount of energy.<br /><br />There are plenty of careless technical gaffes: terrible day-for-night scenes that occur in broad daylight squealing tires in a swamp fire sirens mistakenly stuck on the soundtrack instead of police sirens a bank sign made of duct tape on a ceiling tile a Luger that sounds like a Winchester 30-06 shotgun blasts that cut down people 100 yards away a detective killing a biker on a 3rd floor landing from the ground with a revolver with a 2 inch barrel.<br /><br />There are a whole bunch of goofy story elements : Linda (the girl gang member) disables a bank guard with a drug-filled syringe the final shootout takes place inside a lighthouse (!) police roadblocks dont actually block roads the police apparently never heard of ducking and the police detectives apparently never heard of planting bugs or having their undercover guy wearing a wire.<br /><br />But the plot chugs along the cameraman knows what he is doing the pacing in most scenes is pretty good and there are some nice zippy one liners and dialog exchanges here and there that keep the energy level up. (My favorite: Man youre messing with private stock! (ie Linda) So no dont seek this one out or anything but if a copy of the MST version should fall in your hands you should have some good shallow fun watching it. Vastly superior to Five the Hard Way or The Hellcats or even Girl In Gold Boots (three other MST covered counter culture movies).',neg
'The first time I watched it was when it came out (1994) and the last time I watched it was just before writing this review.. It still makes me laugh my brains out...after all these yearsit dose not disappoint. Truly the smartest Bollywood comedy ever made. This is one Indian movie which deserves its place in the IMDb Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan in probably one of their best performances in comedic roles. The thing that makes this one a time less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing...The jokes are refreshing and not cheap.. This is one film truly ahead of its time.

'There really isnt much to say about this movie....its crude but fun.<br /><br />Plot outline (From IMDB)<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />Two losers from Milwaukee Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone) invent a new game playing basketball using baseball rules. When the game becomes a huge success they along with a billionaires help form the Professional Baseketball League where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities. Coop & Remers team the Milwaukee Beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to institute.<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />The Acting is pretty good since there arnt many big stars in this movie. Although I am not a big fan of Southpark Parker and Stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie. <br /><br />There are so many funny moments in this movie I cant come close to naming them all. It never really lets up and they dont try to put some cruddy drama in to make it more serious. <br /><br />And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. Its GREAT. I especially like Take me on and Beer by Reel Big Fish. Very underrated.<br /><br />Overall a crude but extremely funny movie. 10/10<br /><br />James Black Wolf Johnston',pos
'When people ask me why do I like movies so much I usually respond have you seen the art-gallery sequence in De Palmas Dressed to Kill? That scene alone pretty much represents everything I want to see in a film. If I was a film director that would be the kind of thing Id like to do. Pure cinema is one way of describing that sequence and it is truly amazing to see how director De Palmas entire movie works at the same high artistic frequency of that scene. It is a dream-like movie clever as hell and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen films put together. I think the movie raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion: could a movie rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success? The film has no message to speak of acting is great but it is at the service of the style and the script is short on logic. De Palmas movie makes a really good case that style when handled properly can sustain a feature length film. Sure Michael Caine Angie Dickinson Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give superlative performances but this is a directors movie all the way to the fadeout. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium. I wont tell you what Hitchcock movie the film pays homage to (I dont want to spoil any surprises) but I think De Palma transcends the storys arc and he manages to create a film that pretty much summarizes his entire career. Not for the faint of heart!',pos
'OK so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955.<br /><br />I pity the fools who still think so... Its absolute rubbish.<br /><br />The story is just ... ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satirise im sure its meant to be a serious drama isnt it?<br /><br />Dean and others are too old for their parts. People say Dean is great in this film and well maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly couldve. His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film. Seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy... its pathetic.<br /><br />Natalie Wood is gorgeous but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing. It sets a bad precedent for the film... and for the rest of it you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along.<br /><br />It mayve been good for its time but really its drivel.<br /><br />It mustve just been hype about Deans death that has over-inflated the reputation of this film.',neg
'I felt as though the two hours I spent watching this film may have been better served by perhaps going to the local used bookstore and looking for old fashion magazines and Halston ads. Or perhaps by watching paint dry. Those two employments would have at least engaged my mind a bit more than India Song. The most frustrating part of sitting through this was that I could see what moods/atmospheres were trying to be created and the notion of these could have been interesting if they had been fleshed out more. Instead what happened was a presentation of an incoherent silly chain of nonevents - with the same scenes rehashed over and over to beat some sort of point into our senses.<br /><br />I was loathe to devote more time to this film by writing any sort of review except to perhaps warn other folks against this waste of time.',neg
'We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back. Knowing it was an instant box office failure a failure as a rental I thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on M-Is reputation. Too bad! Nine years ago it was very much a Liberal Agenda objective to trash the Founding Fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the Founding Fathers from many American classrooms including for example New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight of truth into the NJ School Board and their subversive deed. A small part of this was headlining the alleged Sally Hemmings-Thomas Jefferson connection disregarding the inconvenient DNA findings which failed to support the wacky lefts agenda. Never mind! They got James Ellis an author of dubious reputation to put it in a book and Columbia University sealed the deal by giving Ellis a Pulitzer.<br /><br />As to Jefferson in Paris the Liberal Agenda spin begins in the opening scene wherein James Earl Jones is claiming to be the son of Jefferson. The spin simply continues in flashback mode to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes the lie is true the Hemmings allegation would be an insignificant detail into the larger matter of Jeffersons prolonged and vital diplomatic mission to Paris (as well as to the Netherlands where he secured crucial financial backing for America when our infant nation was without funds).<br /><br />Besides the Liberal Spin Job there is nothing else of interest in this drab and tortuously dull movie. Some of the other history is indeed accurate --- adding credence to frame the lie --- but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia.<br /><br />Please do not ask me why Liberals set out to trash the Founding Fathers because I dont waste time explaining the acts of such people. Dont ask them either; they usually respond to such questions with the same answer: SHUT UP!',neg

'In the Old west there are always the men who live breathe violence and the women who hold their breath. A famous ¨town tamer¨ named Clit Tollinger(Robert Mitchum) comes hired by the citizens to rid the gunslingers ( Leo Genn Claude Atkins among others) Baronlands hoodlums. There he meets the blacksmith (Emile Meyer)  his daughter (Karen Sharpe) her boyfriend(John Lupton) the marshal(Henry Hull) and the Saloon owner (Ted De Corsia). Clint as lawman is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts some cartels saying the following : ¨ Warning  wearing of guns or other weapons in town is banned. Check all hardware at the marshals office ¨. Clint finds his ex-girlfriend a local madame (Jan Sterling) in charge of the Saloon girls( Angie Dickinson Barbara Lawrence among them). But the town council afraid the raw methods carried out by Clint . At the end the kingpin landowner appears and attempts to murder Tollinger with his own hands.<br /><br />This is a tremendously exciting story of a sheriff-for-hire who had only one more killing to go. It begins as a slow-moving Western but follows to surprise us with dark characters and solid plot. The tale is almost grim  a pacifier comes to a town just in time to make sure its citizenry but later the events get worse . The highlights are the burning at Saloon and the climatic showdown at the ending. Phenomenal and great role for Robert Mitchum as avenger angel and bitter gunfighter hes the whole show. Vivid and lively musical score by Alex North (Spartacus Cleopatra) Atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Lee Garmes. The motion picture is stunningly realized by Richard Wilson (Al Capone  Three in Attic) who made good Western as ¨Invitation to a gunfighter and ¨Zane Grey¨ episodes. Watchable results for this offbeat Western.',pos
'Treys favourite from the first run of Season 10 and also one of my personal favourites Manbearpig features the adventure of Al Gore before going on global warming and before the movie it was similar a adventure certainly Al Gore was also trying to aware the world about something that can change the Earth something really dangerous this time about something that is half man half bear and half pig Al Gore had only one thing in mind: to aware everyone of Manbearpig and to kill it! Al Gore here is more than hilarious everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes he can childish doing tantrums since nobody believes him but he is just a f****** demented bastard. Basically four kids are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore but certainly he dont have that in his mind theres not space for any other subject is just Manbearpig what concerns Al Gore. Those four kids are Cartman Kenny Kyle and Stan basically Stan felt sorry for AL Gore and the four boys were just playing in Al Gores game never imaging that Gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill Manbearpig (hilarious scene- they are just children damned Manbearpig). So at this part we have on one hand all the stuff with the rescue team who also feel sorry for Al Gore and on the other hand we have a little yet extremely hilarious Cartman episode and there are not surprises of the attitude of Cartman after he finds a treasure inside the cave certainly the whole stuff with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick Cartman in both senses he is really sick for the boys and really sick for us. And in the end Al Gore does killed Manbearpig! This character is a fantastic one and Im cereal! Terrific fun in this episode a highly re-watchable one. 10 out of 10',pos
'Most italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since because it has no connection to the first two Demons films. And with the Demons III in the title one would assume it would. The problem is that this film was never intended to be part of the Demons series. The distributors only a Demons III above its original title The Ogre to cash in on the other films popularity. The new American DVD release of this picture has the title Demons III: The Ogre on the box art but the film itself only says The Ogre. I dont know if past releases had the title Demons III on the actual film itself but this new release just seems to be a little white lie. If you can get past the Demons III in the title you might some enjoyment in The Ogre. It starts out with a creep intro and stays pretty creep throughout. Theres no gore and the film movies slowly but I still dug it. Just dont expect it to be like the other Demons films. I give The Ogre 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try it out.',pos
'Theres a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating. Considering that it was made in 1953 this is a very courageous movie about transvestites tackling the issue fairly seriously and sympathetically (and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject) and trying very hard not to stereotype. The movie clearly makes the point that transvestites are not homosexuals and that aside from wearing womens clothing they lead a relatively normal life. It deals with the pain of not being accepted in society - the plot revolves around a police officer (Lyle Talbot) desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite. So you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial (in the context of 1953) subject.<br /><br />Having said all that Im also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely dreadful. In trying to portray Glen/Glendas (Edward D. Wood) pain the movie falls into silly (and at times surprisingly - again given the era - sensual) fantasies that make the story very hard to follow. The acting is wooden at best. None of the dialogue comes across as real; the actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others. And - worst of all - there was no point to having Bela Lugosi in this movie. This was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took on in the latter stages of his career. Pull the strings; pull the strings poor Lugosis character (called The Spirit in the credits but really coming across as more of a mad scientist) kept crying. And nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />For artistic merit the movie doesnt really deserve much more than 1/10. However for the courage involved in just putting it out Ill give it a 3/10.',neg
'Im not aware of Largo Winch as a comic book (or is it graphic novel? I actually dont know) but I have to admit hearing about an agent/hero movie I did expect quite something different than what I actually got.<br /><br />While it was startling to watch this at first it was nice watching this move along. You could never really tell where it would go (some twists are foreseeable but in general you can never really say were it will end up going). A more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good support cast make this an enjoyable watch. Not as action packed as some might hope or expect for a movie like that but a really good mixture.',pos
'Maybe like most others who have seen this film long after its premiere on television I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form which is exactly what Slow Burn is. Except aside from the nostalgic value the movie itself is not very good.<br /><br />Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash hired by a Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry) a rich artist to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son Brian who had been living with his mother Laine (Beverly DAngelo) for the past few years. In a Phillip Marlowe-esquire fashion Jacob Ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of Brian. But once Jacob tracks down Laine his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble. Perhaps because events in the film move too slowly there is never much suspense to this little thriller not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives.<br /><br />However as said before this movie is probably one that will draw attention for its then-relatively unknown cast of actors which include both a very young Eric Roberts as well as the adorable Johnny Depp who plays Laines stepson Donnie. That may be reason enough to give it a try...if you can find it.',neg
'Itd be easy to call Guys and Dolls great. Its got Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando (and contrary to Sinatras original wishes the casting works) its got a really cool 1950s feel even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption. And most of the songs are often a lot of fun and catchy and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself. If its not entirely as great as some others of its ilk it shouldnt be any fault of the filmmaker Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Not all the songs entirely click and a little of the dialog feels like its being performed for the stage as opposed to film (its hard to tell at times- Brando and Sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the stage while the actress playing Adele is better for stage than screen).<br /><br />The plot is one of those winners that works well for its period even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999s Shes All That (well not quite but close). A gambler (and 14-year betrothed) played by Sinatra wants to host a big-time game but is told that the heat is on meaning the cops are on watch. So he has only one choice to host the game with a thousand dollar tab. The only way he can get it is through a big-time bet with fellow gambler Brando whos put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker. It allows for the predictable twists in the story in the sudden turn-on-turn-off of the charms of the character of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets (gangsters and dancers and the saitn played by Jean Simmons who falls for Brando). It is in its basic concept about this whole world of guys and dolls and how to balance one or the other- obviously without getting married or too compromised.<br /><br />Mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece even when keeping still with the camera on the subject and his stars are properly reeled in. Hell even Brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply THE method actor and shows his chops for singing and big-star quality. The story and characters eventually wind down to what youd hope will happen and thats fine. All we ask for- and what we get- is entertainment in good spurts of witty involving dialog and a few songs and dances that bring the house down (my favorites were the number with the lady-cats at the club Luck be a Lady and the two numbers down in Havana Cuba).

Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other it made them closer as friends. They werent gay lovers like your bitching about.

Bernard Herrmann appears as himself near the climax.<br /><br />The scenery and locations are great except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake which doesnt make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots. Ive heard that Hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes.<br /><br />The reviews for this movie seem to be mixed. I think this is a better than average Hitchcock movie.

'This is one the worst movie Ive seen and certainly worst movie Nagesh Kuknoor has made. I cant believe person who has created movie like Teen Deewarein can create utter crap like this. <br /><br />Plot of the film itself is really faulty that Zeenat has to search Meera and get her clemency to help her husband avoid death penalty in Soudi Arabia. Common logic says if Zeenat cannot search Meera easily so wont the Soudi Government so Zeenat can safely forge Meeras signature or thumb-print and produce it before the Soudis. Another silliest thing is Shankar has given incorrect address in his passport so Indian government officials cannot get to the address but after sometime Meera gets Shankars suitcase through Soudi government. Wow! Doesnt it make Soudis well networked in India more than Indians?<br /><br />Nagya makes a slightly more than cameo in the movie with role of Chopra who is eyeing Meera and seeks Meeras Father-in-law Girish Karnaad(this guy is just wasted)s help to get her as a keep. <br /><br />Nagya cannot speak Hindi and he has been assisted by other guys to translates the English dialogs he writes in Hindi. This time it seems that his aide was in serious intoxication when writing dialogs like Imaan ki Chalaang (leap of honesty). Within minutes to our worst nightmares Meera not only takes this honest leap she taps her feet to do Imaan ka Naach (dance of honesty).<br /><br />One of the only bright spot movie has is its cinematography and really nice hues. But since Bollywood has learned the thing called Post-production almost all the movies have vibrant colors and nicely blended backdrops so no big deal.<br /><br />Conclusion is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas Nagyas and all are ready to get affected.',neg
'The complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. I am okay with these night time soaps like Greys Anatomy or Ugly Betty or West Wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. However when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (Taye Diggs Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital it seems like General Hospital...or a female counterpart to Baywatch. That was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.',neg
'This is just flat out unwatchable. If theres a story in here somewhere its so deeply buried beneath the horrid characters and jarring camera work thats its indiscernible.

Opening with a funny prologue which apes a Twisted Sister video from the 80s The Pick of Destiny is a fairly well-produced movie aimed at older kids; it occasionally resembles nothing more than a middle-aged variation of Waynes World with jokey-stoner interludes and a climactic bout with Beelzebub himself yet Black and Gass have an enormously comfortable rapport (they also acted as producers co-wrote the script and all the music). The target audience will obviously go for it though inspiration is a bit low particularly in the second-half (just about the time our heroes impulsively outrun the cops in a student-driver car).

'The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not admittedly all that original. Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both.

All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinema.<br /><br />I was reading Chekhovs Three Sisters the other day and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film. In Act 2 Masha objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding:<br /><br />MASHA: Surely mankind must believe in something or at least seek for the truth otherwise life is just emptiness emptiness. To live and not to know why the cranes are flying why children are born why there are stars in the sky. Either you must know why it is you live or everything is trivial - mere pointless nonsense.<br /><br />Likewise Veronika has a hard time believing that the war and her and others sufferings have been pointless. Better to assign a meaning to live as if ones life is significant and not to give in to despair. It is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the film.<br /><br />BTW as a minor correction to one other comment here--there may be a pattern of Vs in the film though I hadnt noticed them myself.

'I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /><br />1 ) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest:  I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo  and  Ill better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodles head in my bed  <br /><br />2 ) Surprise winners: No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeers and boos ) but they won <br /><br />Last years award ceremony wasnt too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it wasnt the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP was much better )but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links  but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) Im sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers <br /><br />Chris Rock wasnt too bad  but hes no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the  minor  Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! Theres no such thing as a  minor  Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design theyre as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasnt for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves <br /><br />Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category <br /><br />Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of Americas greatest living character actors <br /><br />Best Actor - Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn <br /><br />Best Actress - Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night <br /><br />Best Director - Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because hed never won one . Actually Im glad about this because if he didnt deserve it for TAXI DRIVER  RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didnt deserve it for THE AVIATOR <br /><br />Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDBs controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off <br /><br />What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they havent done in the past  I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawds sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts',neg
'Batman Mystery of the Batwoman is in a word stale. <br /><br />The plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante (Batwoman) is intruding on Batmans turf and while Batman is trying to combat a Penguin/Bane/Rupert Thorne threesome hes trying to figure out who the mysterious Batwoman is. <br /><br />There is nothing strikingly wrong about this but there is nothing really special about it either noting really made it stick out. <br /><br />Mask of the Phantasm had Bruces long lost love re surface and mess with his head.<br /><br />Subzero was a major event in the life of Mr Freeze. <br /><br />Even the Batman Beyond movie spin off Return of the Joker dug deep with the characters involved. <br /><br />But Mystery of the Batwoman had some minor subplots a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat. Frankly this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight lacking the punch and bite that the Animated Series had in its prime.',neg
'Geez as a Gay man who lives in NYC I can gratefully say that I have never seen the underbelly of Gay Culture that is portrayed in this film - and I am glad of it!!! Was this film broadcast on TV across the United States there would be a great anti-Gay backlash and I cannot say that I would blame them. The people in this film do not represent the average Gay American or even the average Trandgender American what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare. The inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments (anti-White) are blatant and unsettling - society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the films cast - the actions of these people are not acts of desperation but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of ones self.',neg
'SEVEN POUNDS: EMOTIONALLY FLAT ILLOGICAL MORALLY DISTURBING<br /><br />The movie was distributed in Italy as Seven Souls. I was curious about the original title and after some research I found out that it refers to Shakespeares Merchant of Venice where the usurer Shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant Antonio who will have to give him a pound of his flesh in case he is not able to repay his debt. Whereas the Italian translation makes Bens plan something deeply human characterized by human sympathy the original one though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone makes it just in its reference to the flesh something cold rational deep-rooted in the physical side of man. Unfortunately I think that the real quality of Bens plan is revealed by the original title: ita a cold machination aimed at donating parts of his body but lacking any authentic human empathy at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie. The only exception is the love-story with the girl which seems to be a sort of non-programmed incident to which Ben yields but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement. I really didnt like the idea at the core of the movie: the idea that a person however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide: besides being improbable it makes no sense. I would have liked and I think it would have been more positive if in the end Ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living thus helping those same people and maybe many more just standing near them and helping them through his presence. He wouldnt have saved their lives miraculously of course: this would have probably caused more suffering but I think it could have been more constructive from a human and moral point of view. There are many illogical and disturbing things: the initial reference to Gods creation in seven days (which by the way according to the Bible are six!): what does it mean? And what about a woman suffering from heart-disease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad who can have normal sex with a man who feeling as it should be destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body doesnt seem to feel so much tried both emotionally and physically from his impaired condition? The movie is saved by good acting but all the rest is pure nonsense not only from a logical point of view but also from a human and emotional one.',neg
'Another fabulous movie from Catherine Breillat this time about the difficulties of shooting a sex scene in a movie. Using comedy  a new genre for Breillat  we get a backstage view of filmmaking but in documentary style. The character who plays the director in the movie is based on Breillat the sex scene in question is taken from her earlier film A Ma Soeur as is the main teenage actress. But the film like all of Breillats work is not entertainment alone. It is peppered with philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality as well as demonstrating a devotion to purity (as opposed to pornography) that is a cornerstone of Breillats work and a devotion to real emotion. We see the director character harangue the young lead actress and actor to bring the best out in them hypnotising them into the parts they need to play bringing out part of themselves that the director can see in them but they cannot see in themselves until they achieve the heights of acting that she demands of them. She makes meaningful movies not titillation but she shows the work that is needed to produce this and so gives us insights both into the (decidedly French) film making process and the psychology of male  female sexuality.',pos
'Obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well. George Lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his Star Wars series seems to a homage to Gunga Din. The characters that Grant McLaglen and Fairbanks play are just precursors of Han Solo Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Sam Jaffes Gunga Din morphed into C-3PO and R2-D2 and like him or not: Jar Jar Binks.<br /><br />Today this film is viewed as non PC but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru the leader of the Indian opposition to the British raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today. <br /><br />To a young boy this was a great film. Three strong male leads and only a hint of romance. There was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in Saturday matinee film was just mush. Not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight. Too late to lament lost innocence.<br /><br />Hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at TCM and catch a film with action adventure and a cast of thousands instead of CGI actors.',pos
'Just a regular Jason lee movie There were some parts of the movie that were funny. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess. These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties. It was an all right movie. It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie. This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central. I am glad that I didnt see this movie in the theater I would have been angry. But I guess thats why I didnt see it in the theater.',neg
'Either or I love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie. I have re-visited it many times and it always holds up. A little too stylized for some but I fancy that any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison a fellow Canadian takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious as this one is. I have often wondered at the paucity of Chers acting roles whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on. I have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in Mask. I found the comedic strokes broad at times ( a hair salon called Cinderella)but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera all extravagant gestures at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat. The Brooklyn scenes are magical this is a Brooklyn under moonlight romanticized and dramatic just like opera. All in all a very satisfying film not to everyones taste by a long shot I loved the ending everyone brought together like a Greek Chorus every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others the camera pulling away down the hall leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.',pos
'This movie tries to say something profound; Im just not sure what it was. Too much is left unresolved in the end for me to figure out the main point. A couple scenes really have me wondering what was left on the cutting room floor. I dont think the wall was very well developed I never got what was actually going on there. When the mother finally unveils it I just couldnt make any connection to the boys silence. What was the point of the boy not talking? Was he just delusional or did he acquire some sort of power. What was the scene with the burnt girl all about? Another power the boy has or what? I dont understand how that developed any character or moved the plot. I got the bully bit but what happened to the dog? Did the dog come back or did mom get rid of Fido for good somehow? <br /><br />There were several additional plot elements that were more clutter than use. Like the radio talk show in the background discussing the Iraq War. I think that was supposed to create some sort of comparison to the grief and insecurity the mother and Addison were experiencing but for me it was distracting and strained. I didnt buy the link very much. I also found the teacher getting on Addison about not saying here for roll call a bit much. The mom seeing the doctor was pointless how did it serve the plot? Was that to show how desperate the mother was getting or was it something about the medicine that I didnt get? Was that the dad coming back in the last scene or just some guy? So did writing on the wall work? What happened to the Dog?',neg

'Something very strange happens when you talk about Global Warming: science goes out the window and belief and consensus becomes the topic of discussion.<br /><br />Its because of that fact that I give a failing mark to Al Gores documentary.<br /><br />Instead of promoting intelligent discussion he kept the debate at the level of belief and consensus.<br /><br />Of course when youre trying to sell the world into spending trillions of dollars to stop Global Warming you may thing its a problem to tell the scientific truth: we dont know how much of the current warming was caused by humans. Maybe none of it maybe some of it or maybe it has over-ceded the next Ice Age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planet.<br /><br />But the fact remains that we dont know.<br /><br />so were asked to believe in the consensus. Never mind that any scientist that strays from the consensus is ostracized. Never mind that scientific inquiry is about straying from the consensus. Einstein didnt believe in the consensus neither did Copernicus or Galileo.<br /><br />So why so much scorn placed on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the tough questions? If Global Warming is so incontrovertible surely a few people testing that theory cant be so threatening.<br /><br />What is going on here? Thats the movie I was hoping Al Gore would have made.

'College students (who are actually in their late 20s) on campus in Boston (which looks strangely like the Isle Of Man) are menaced by a fierce monster (assembled during a Blue Peter episode). The new teacher must save the day (Even though he is really... Oh who cares?)<br /><br />Ill start with the positives... there is a nice shot of Eastenders new gal Samantha Januss can in the obligatory campus shower scene with her best mate Katy Lawrence. A bit of side trivia: Katy was hired when she arrived at auditions with her sister just as moral support to her sibling but ended up landing a part. Oh joy. Picked from obscurity to... flash her pert buttocks in a meaningless scene added for titillation then getting killed 30 minutes in for her troubles. Her latest (and only other credited role) is as Probationary Nurse #5 in Atonement. I wonder if she snuck a look at Keira Knightly (if extras and stars are allowed to mix) and wondered: where did it all go wrong?!<br /><br />Ill give a few hints Katy: If all the other British cast members are asked to speak with American accents in a doomed attempt at mass-marketing and the only person who can manage it is the B-movie veteran USA native Todd Jensen you know youre in trouble. If you look at your wage slip and itll only just about cover your lunch and your bus ride home you aint starring in a movie with a trillion dollar budget. If the premiere is attended by loads of family members of the fourth assistant director and provokes gales of laughter when the Stickyback tape monster rampages through the sewers it should dawn on you that this isnt exactly Alien. Or even a Critters IV come to think of it. So Katy in your next life (Im a Buddhist you see) perhaps youll be a bit more selective in your choice of debut feature rather than impulsively jumping at the first pile of crap that heads your way. Flashing skin in your first movie does not guarantee long lasting success. Unless youre Sylvester Stallone. And he had the script to Rocky to back him up.<br /><br />To all intents and purposes this is as 0/10 a movie as Ive ever seen. However for sheer unintentional laughs and pure camp value it gets a 1.

'OK we got JP from Grandmas Boy and Chuck from well Chuck. I thought this movie would be quite good based on the reviews and it did start out pretty high on my movie scale but about halfway through it was just dragging out for so long I kept losing interest. I actually got so bored probably because you can see right away whats going to happen in the end; the story is actually quite thread-bare I skipped over 15 minutes and didnt miss a thing! This film should have been a short work maybe around 45 minutes to an hour max. It starts out good and finishes good too bad the filling is bland boring dull and lacks everything but time. Some people say they like it for the music; I dont care for jazz and I dont go see movies for their score I go for the story and when thats drawn out... well ratings drop in my book.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Good open great close boring filler. Story was cool but if you dont know whats going to happen a quarter of the way through you havent seen too many thrillers.',neg
'This movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone such as The Robe Quo Vadis and Samson and Delilah unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isnt a Jew or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on biblical-related stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned nothing good came from pagan Egypt Greece or Rome.<br /><br />Any movie that preaches about the one true god gives a short shift to freedom of religion. The movies ignore the fact that ancient Judeas lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism. Most 1950s religious movies also overlook the loss of freedom the occurred after Christians assumed political power in the 4th century.',neg

'I should have known when I heard Anne Rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me. I couldnt have predicted that years after its release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. The novels are amazing and while I understand much gets lost in the translation to screen this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work. I hope one day someone tries again the right way starting with The Vampire Lestat. They change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason. They destroy Lestats history. The acting of the Queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy but I just cant bring myself to laugh. The charm and allure of the novels just isnt there. The movie is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and dark imagery as possible into one movie hoping the teeny Goths of America would lap it up. Part of the appeal of the first movie of Louis story is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Thank goodness I read the books first or Id have never touched them after this movie.',neg

He had that innocence but at the same time he was strong as well.<br /><br />This new kid Alex? Annoying as all hell! Just a blatant ripoff at trying to match Culkins charm and grace failing miserably at that.<br /><br />The villains complete crap. Harry and Marv they were such an entertaining on screen team. They were comedic they were humorous and just made you really want to root for Culkin even more which is what a good villain is suppose to do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern absolutely PERFECT for those roles. On the other hand in 3 we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. Not saying they were horrible but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining. More on the corny side actually.<br /><br />Then we got the actual movies. Part 1 and 2 classics. Memorable. Perfect to watch around Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story and care about the characters. Simply memorable and close to being masterpieces. Part 3? Masterpiece of crap. Enough said.<br /><br />All and all I dont know why people like this. I think people really dont know what a good movie is anymore.

'OK lets get right to the point. We have five recent college grads (must have majored in the F word) going out on a weekend camping trip. They run into someone who is in need of help but instead of trying to assist him they decide to set him on fire instead. Nice bunch of people. Next some of them start go get sick - must be something in the water at the cabin they are staying at. However the neighbors seem to be OK. Oh well when things start getting really bad they lock up one their companions instead of getting help (try the neighbor by the way). Some locals dont take a liking to them. They chase one on a high speed romp through the woods for many miles until the truck breaks down. Somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the cabin (how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another of the brain surgeon type at the cabin realizes something is amiss so he hides out in a cave to let this blow over. He then decides the next day to return to the cabin believing it must be some type of shrine. He is giddy with relief that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24 hour bug). Unfortuneatley he is met by some not so friendly police officers. Another couple decide to have sex while the flesh eating bug is working its magic and then the women realizes she needs to shave her legs (taking a lot of the diseased skin with shaving cream). Anyway you get the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people I would not want to be friends with. I was rooting for the flesh eating bacteria. Other characters were introduced who were also somewhat amusing but utterly unlikeable as well. Ninety minutes of good life wasted here.',neg
'In my opinion this has to be one of Barbara Stanwycks best performances. She was one of only a handful of actors then and now who could say more with a single look than an entire page of dialogue. And I was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage. Too bad the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in his illegal speakeasy. Her only link to anything is her good friend Chico played wonderfully by Theresa Harris. Though Chico is African American (and having a white woman be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was as controversial as the subject matter of this movie) and Lily is not they have a special bond. And it is not sexual. Just 2 women stuck or shoved into a situation beyond their control. After Lilys father dies and she does not know what she will do she is told that she has the power to get out and to get what she wants. Yes its immoral but thats the entire point of this movie. Then they had to go and ruin the last few minutes. So up until the last few minutes of the movie its a superb film and worth watching. The lesson of the movie is still as valid today as it was back then and Im sure will be a 100 years from now. Women its awful what Lily does in order to get what she wants but it works. Men take note.',pos
'I was surprised Once More My Darling had not generated enough votes (at this writing) for a user rating. Its a screwy comedy I have enjoyed many times over the years. Robert Montgomerys mission places him in some very improbable situations and hes just the man for the job. He maintains his trademark befuddled look throughout the film and hysterically too. Ann Blyth plays his precocious/eccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist.

'<br /><br />The kind of movie that demands too much from the audience yet to disappoint most of them. I think of the Mexican people who (either in an attempt to support Mexican movies or willing to see a film casting top Mexican stars) saw it half of the people went out of the theater when I went to watch it its definitely not the kind of movie one could expect. I think too of the people from other countries who dared spending 2 hours seeing it till the very end what a piece of crap. In order to understand Cronica de un desayuno one has to be mexican and one has to be familiar with the low middle classes (or even better be part of them). Theres nothing accidental in this movie the family is and has what many families in Mexico at least share. One has to see it with a wide open mind to accept it entirely its not the kind of movie that you fully understand after you watch it. The older brother wouldnt let anyone sit on his RED couch the sister is staying no matter how she wants to leave the younger brother is going to an excursion and all he cares about is the yellow radio the mother has to prepare the breakfast for the family no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is. The father came back after who knows how long allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be momentary and ends up by repeating all the attitudes of his sons... The stories around the house are surrealistic (and so is the movie) a travestite looking for his penis a factory worker and his attempt of suicide subtled by the kisses of his girlfriend a fat man riding his bicycle after a interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? wife? mother?... The music doesnt pretend too much but it achieves a lot not more than a snare drum cymbal a some strings.

'I found this to be an underrated quietly compelling Spaghetti Western (also known as DEAD OR ALIVE). Despite modest credentials (apart from multi-purpose co-writer/producer Albert Band the only notable crew member is composer Carlo Rustichelli) the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three American stars (newcomer Alex Cord is an ambiguous anti-hero while veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan lend a mythic quality to the proceedings) as well as the unusual plot (involving a crippled protagonist an amnesty ruse covering a strategic clean-up of the town and which has the law finally siding with the gunfighter against a horde of Mexican bandits).<br /><br />There are several tough action scenes on hand  the film is capped by a terrific climax in which the star trio is besieged inside a blazing cabin  plus a couple of outrageous moments which are something of a Spaghetti Western trademark: from the middle of the street Cord sees a hidden gunman at a window reflected in a whiskey bottle; a man who helps Cord escape is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the villains. Nicoletta Machiavelli also makes a nice impression as a village girl with whom Cord lodges; the supporting cast then is peppered with familiar (if largely anonymous) faces  all of them essentially genre fixtures.<br /><br />I wasnt aware of the fact that the English-dubbed version of the film on MGM/UAs R1 DVD was cut: I was fooled by the wrong running-time being listed on the back-cover; the film was only 99 minutes long and not 118  apparently Cords character is killed in the longer Italian version!',pos
'IN LOVING MEMORY OF DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000)<br /><br />When I watched this movie for the first time I was 4 years old and I got fascinated by this story of witches in the 2nd World War. The scene which impressed me the most was the fight between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march. This movie is fantastic from the trip to Portobello Road (which became to me the most fantastic place of London) to the journey to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. She is always great it seems the good aunt of a family and David with his always astonished face is her great co-protagonist. well miss him a lot.',pos

She would most likely deny all involvement.<br /><br />In short there is no part of this movie worth seeing except to laugh at how bad it sucks. Rent this to see the worst film ever made bar none.',neg
'This show was crap when it first came on. The first actress that played the daughter didnt fit the role the writing was hit or miss and Damon Wayans CLEARLY wasnt comfortable doing such a cornball family friendly show. The chemistry between himself and Tisha Cambell (theyre long time friends as are all of the Wayans clan with Tishas husband and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett) DID work so they retooled the show. Once it returned they recast the daughter made the son much dumber (a la Eric from Boy Meets World)and made the youngest daughter into a genius...(later they gave her a little genius boyfriend to do comedic guest appearances). The show while if often rollercoasters from over the top buffoonery to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see Damon Wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set (especially since the main writers directors and consultants were ALL members of the Wayans family) AND in his character. Once everyone had been on the show for a while they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the air.<br /><br />However there is TOO MUCH buffoonery too many over the top antics and oftentimes too much chaos happening in the life of the Kyle family. They made Junior TOO STUPID they also made the eldest daughter an attractive clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter wasnt even spared by the writers. I feel they jumped the shark and signed the shows death warrant when Junior got his girlfriend pregnant she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced (Juniors wifes fathers character makes me WINCE just thinking about him). The show remained funny...but it was a UPN show on ABC if that makes any sense to the reader.<br /><br />The reruns are funny enough but Im relieved its over...there was nowhere left to go with it. When its bad its REALLY BAD. It tends to be cornball at times but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom make it to syndication on a major network..Who can say that for themselves now? (Given the CW merger and the brownout on TV networks lately that is). One.',pos
'First of all this is a low-budget movie so my expectations were incredibly low going into it. I assume most people looking at the info for this movie just wanted a bloodfest and essentially thats all it is.<br /><br />Plot? There really is none. Its basically Saw but in China and a whole hell of a lot worse. Cast? There is none period. Special Effects? Absolutely awful in my opinion... There were cutaways and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts splatter color texture etc.<br /><br />I believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal shock film. Now it had some great potential on a bigger budget but poor scripting poor dialogue awful acting what seemed like camcorder video shots and just plain unbelievable gore made this movie truly awful.<br /><br />There are movies worth taking a chance against some reviews even b-rate movies deserve some opportunities (blood trails for example was the most recent I saw against reviews that was worth it) but this was simply awful. I hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against it.<br /><br />Im all for brutality and shock but the overall unrealism and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience. Save your time/money and chance something else you wont be disappointed.',neg

'Its interesting to see what shape Pierce Brosnans career was in before Bond arrived on the scene. In this tense thriller Pierce Brosnan plays the gentle Patrick who works leading ghetto kids on confidence courses. He romances a woman who has a bog-standard mop-top mid-90s kid called Eric. The womans drunken ex-husband soon arrives on the scene and begins to mess with Pierce.<br /><br />At one stage Pierce is innocently making vegeburgers. The husband enters. Pierce resumes making vegeburgers. The husband then assaults Pierce. Little chunks of half-eaten vegeburger call fall from Pierces mouth. The fight abruptly ends without showing the outcome.

'Just lovely. It is long. No climax. Dont wait for anything to happen. Great for a rainy day. About a man in a mid life crisis who takes his family to a secluded area of the Greek isles. I saw this in my teens and still love it 20+ years later. I have been unable to find it in video stores however. Molly Ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then kind of settles into the place. There are no phones no TV boredom which when hit with quietness like that the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect. And each character does so. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with John Cassavetes character but he is unable to well you know. Gina Rowlands is the wife that loves him but is just about to give up on their marriage. He is demanding and frustrating to everyone. There is another character in the movie a Greek who talks to Molly Ringwald inappropriately about sex but things that she is curious about. But he is irritating and horny and i didnt like this character. The locale of the film is what makes this film so so good. It wouldnt work if filmed anywhere else. I recommend this film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.',pos
'Just watched this movie and its not bad; there are a few tense moments and not a lot of long dialog strings. Comes off as fairly intelligent; fastpaced almost like documentary style. This movie will evoke some nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia with carsstreet scenesand life in the 50s. The acting is fairly solid and at 85 minutes run time it goes by at a good pace. An atomic era film buff shouldnt miss this one.',pos
'Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace Charles Babbage the history of computers etc I was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of the Math technology or history constituting the films subject but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them. This hits a sore spot with me as Ive long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion eg: Emmy Coer: information waves have a half-life Ada: Im not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all.<br /><br />This movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms. The only redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts. Its more likely I think to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic.',neg
'I just found the entire 3 DVD set at Wal-Mart in the bargain bin for $5.50 so I thought I would take another look. Total of 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on TV in the sixties. Many independent stations repeated them for many years.<br /><br />Better than I expected actually time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of its creators and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the Allied fighting men and women. More abstract and arty than a straight forward documentary but very truthful in its depiction of the causes and final results of WWII. That war was greatly dependent on sea transportation and the final victory was dependent on who achieved the final mastery of the worlds oceans. The Allies were the ones who were able to do it.<br /><br />Interesting too to see how they try to strike a balance between big events and the individual soldiers and sailors that made them happen. The score is impressive if a bit too much by todays standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett contributed just as much as Richard Rodgers to final score. I imagine that Rodgers provided all the major themes and it was up to Bennett to fit them to the images. Great job!<br /><br />Should be seen by every ruler or potential ruler. A warning to tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals determination and the supplies to back them up. Logistics: their quality and delivery will determine the eventual victors. The Allies outproduced and surpassed the material quality of the Axis attacked their very source in the process and insured their eventual defeat.<br /><br />Sorry to see that the producer Henry Salomon lived a very short life. IMDbs facts were rather skimpy I have to find out more about him. He did a few more outstanding documentaries before his early death. Might have more to say at a later time<br /><br />Trivia: I had all 3 LP records made of the background music pretty good overall. Unfortunately the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one relegating immediately to just novelty status rather than for serious music listening. Too bad too because it contained some interesting but more minor themes in the series. Silly stuff like 16 inch guns firing torpedoes being fired bulldozers planes...just for kids mainly.<br /><br />RSGRE',pos
'When I first saw this show I thought it looked interesting. I watched it saw how it revolved around Sarah like the character sees the world...revolving around her. I got it but wasnt laughing very much.<br /><br />Onstage and in her show shes racist crude insensitive and hugely self-centered. I didnt get her at first and took it all at face value. Then I got to see her movie Jesus is Magic. I think that served as a Sarah Silverman primer for me explaining to me just what language shes speaking. Shes like Marilyn Manson working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images but you eventually realise it isnt an assault its a statement. And once you understand that you find youre glad someones finally giving it to you straight.<br /><br />I dont mean to suggest only smart people will understand or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy. While I like a lot of smart shows I still to this day do not see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I get the impression that its good but I just dont get it. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman Program but Im glad I eventually came around.<br /><br />The creators of this show do work hard every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot but with songs or dream sequences production numbers. These people arent putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together. If I was to predict the future of this show Id say it will go the way of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will get canceled before its time and live on in fans hearts and on DVD. But take heart SSP creators your audience IS out there and well be watching for as long as they let you make the show.',pos
'i havent seen this in years but when i was about 6 i first saw this on VHS and i must have watched it at least 10 times. now like i said its been awhile so i might screw up the plot but i remember some Columbian terrorists taking a prep school hostage with demands for the head terrorist(the wishmaster)father to be released from prison. now i could just check the plot here on IMDb but im pretty sure thats right. any way a group of boys at the school decide that theyre not gonna just sit around and wait to die so they decide to fight back. this film has always been stuck in my mind. there are so many images that i havent forgotten like Joeys(i think?)death scene or billy spitting in the terrorists sandwiches or the one kids(no idea of his name)fake asthma attack. just a great film. it may be films like this that have given me my tolerance for film violence because if i remember right this movie is pretty graphic. guys getting mowed down by helicopter machine guns a special forces guys hand getting blown off by a grenade(not sure about that but i seem to remember something like that towards the end)and the most bloody being the lead terrorist getting capped in the head in gory detail. great action great humor good acting wonderful film experience. ive got to watch this again after all these years!',pos

'Generally political messages are done on television so if you are a big fan of environmental correctness watch to your hearts content. Most people go to the movies to be entertained not sold some poppycock political nonsense. The hook here is the big name cast. Unfortunately the sum of the performances equals a whole movie that went absolutely nowhere. The two best performances Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus have minimal screen time. In short Silver City is to be avoided as entertainment. It is nothing more than a non documentary rambling political expose on illegal immigration pollution and any number of other causes that do not belong anywhere except on the small screen. - MERK',neg

This film is more than just a documentary (that offers not more than cold facts) with long mono/-duologues and lots of charts...The complete power of this movie comes from the impressive pictures being filmed under water in the air or the Arctic.With watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than with just reading a book it shows that WE are embedded in the circular flow of life.

'I could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end. I cannot comment on the story as I did not watch the whole film and the reason I couldnt watch it was because of the actors. Firstly for the most part they just looked stiff and Im sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame - but thats a minor issue. The main issue I have with the actors isnt really their fault... its whoever cast this film! Come on this movie came out in 2003...

'This film is totally unbelievable. The only way a girl would perform this act on a dog is if she had serious mental health issues or had a long history of sexual abuse or was under duress. Yet we are asked to believe that an otherwise normal healthy female just got a bit bored and made a little mistake and oops had a sexual encounter with a dog. Whats more it never had any detrimental affect on her ever again except when she tells someone.<br /><br />Not she was raped by a dog or the dog did something she couldnt resist - she actively initiated oral sex and completed this activity with a pet dog of her own choice. She wasnt on drugs or anything she just felt like it.<br /><br />The rest of the film seeks to put this action in a light of hey it could happen to anyone shes only being honest.<br /><br />But really for this to be believed we have to believe that this is a woman who is capable of doing absolutely ANYTHING if she just feels like it. Think about it - could she have considered the rights and wrongs of this action before carrying it out? If she had she would have stopped in her tracks. Human beings have instinctive boundaries for reasons. If we are now to start considering bestiality as a cute little aberration what is next? Child abuse? Yet the heroine is portrayed as a hard done by nice girl who had one moment of aberration. If she had been forced to carry out this act by an abuser - the story might have made more sense and I would have been able to accept the storyline. But there is no way that anyone carries out the prolonged activity required and referred to even once - if there is not some deep disturbance that requires a great deal of psychiatric help. This is NO WAY a one off happening in an otherwise perfect life.<br /><br />I know this is just a film but it is through normalising behaviour such as this via the media that society becomes desensitised and more and more awful realities become possible.<br /><br />I could imagine an abuser showing this to a child to persuade them that it isnt such a big deal and then moving on with their agenda. It could also be used by an abuser to underline to a child not to tell about the abuse - because look how people will react to you if you do.<br /><br />This is not about truth. The director WANTS people to think its about truth. This is about degradation and how easily people (the viewing public)can be manipulated into accepting the most appalling concepts if wrapped up in the right way. The watching public are being manipulated degraded and laughed at.<br /><br />This is a film in which the actors and the viewers are being humiliated and made fools of in a very sophisticated way by a clever but extremely disturbed film writer.<br /><br />This film appears to me to be being used as a vehicle for the creator of the film to get off on the excitement of playing with your mind in an abusive manner. I dont know whether it is conscious on their part - but it is the most classic example of Mind F***k that I have ever encountered.<br /><br />I hope that this doesnt offend anyone too much. But if you watched this film - I dont think there is any room left to be offended by anything any more.',neg
'This was pretty inevitable. This movie borrows from The Core and from the film it borrowed from Armageddon and the films it borrowed from and so on. Except this time theres Luke Perry too. This films version of the familiar save-the-world plot involves super-earthquakes beginning in the Pacific Northwest and extending too the whole ring of fire. Its soon determined that everybody on Earth just might be doomed. So the military and some scientists build one of those high-tech drilling machines to go inside the Earth and fix things (it just wouldnt be as much fun if they didnt have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet). Theres even a line the tries to make the journey into the Earth sound more impressive than the journey into space (like the one in Armageddon). Its a Sci-Fi Network movie so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie. There is in-fighting between scientists and military guys there are rock-melting lasers people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all and above all there are (weak CGI) special effects. Not original and not all that entertaining. This is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do particularly if youve got beer.',neg
'Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago but it has absolutely stood the test of time and I have watched it several times since. <br /><br />Everything about this film is brilliant from the poignant performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well I still find myself welling up every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences. <br /><br />Its a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers arent prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one. Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools. <br /><br />10/10',pos
'I feel like Im the only kid in town who was annoyed by Branaghs performance. He is a fine actor by most accounts but he simply could not pull off the Southern accent. I mean it was deplorable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. One of the previous reviewers questioned why U.S. actors were not cast in this film. I second that notion. Its wonderful when actors/actresses wish to expand their horizons but its another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained. Maybe it was Altman but hes a such a great director...<br /><br />Well I really dont want to bash Branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much. Everybody deserves to screw up here and there. But it is hard to watch something so annoying that youd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through The Gingerbread Man.',neg

'Will Spanner (David Byrnes the fifth actor to play the role in the series) stumbles onto another bizarre case this time involving vampires rather than the usual witches warlocks & demons (hes at the hospital to check on his friends son who got hurt in a hit and run when they wheel a girl whos been attacked by a vamp in). He brings in Detectve Lutz to help out with the case which revolves around a clandestine vampire organization trying to get a business merger to go through to let them legally own all the blood banks in the world or some such nonsense.<br /><br />The plot of this movie pretty much takes a backseat to the nudity & simulated sex scenes. (As is to be expected from this series i guess). So complaining about the lack of good acting or compelling plot-line or even convincing characters I suspect would fall on deaf ears. If youre watching this film you dont care about such frivolities and just want some action. Sadly on that front the film fails as well. All the woman are attractive enough but the way the scenes are filmed are just atrocious. Making this more or less an exercise in futility in every conceivable way.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Both Kimberly Blair & April Breneman show everything; Ashlie Rhey shows full- frontal; Aline Kassman & Mai-Lis Holmes only shows their breasts<br /><br />My Grade: D',neg
'This film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life. We get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight. A very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war dont just happen on the front.<br /><br />Luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents grandparents or parents went through during a war. This film I think is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazingly like a young Peter OToole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be. Its definitely worth listening to him recite High Flight and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with Shakespeare.',pos
'2001: A Space Odyssey <br /><br />Is it a sermon? An account of the history of mankind? An exploration of mans futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him? Is it about the fragile balance of time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacular effects show; a film Kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words? <br /><br />2001: A Space Odyssey is all of these things. One of the most interpretable films ever created its almost more fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the film than it is to actually watch. But its left open to discussion intentionally; if Kubrick had explained the meaning to his wondrous 1968 classic (ranked #22 on AFIs list of the greatest 100 films ever made my personal 21st favorite filmcurrently-- and nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Director Original Screenplay Art Direction and Visual Effects which it won for) it would have lost half its fascination all of its complexity and a good portion of its cinematic worth. We would only be left with the technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth praising.<br /><br />Because every shot is worth taking the time to look. And there is plenty of time. 2001 is very elegiac and also coolly distant; detached. The emotional remoteness and slow pace pay perfect tribute however to the unique visual experience; 2001 begins with mankinds ape ancestors who upgrade from scavengers of the planet to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a giant monolith in the midst of their desert home then (in one of motion picture historys most inspired jump-cut edits) as a bone is tossed into the air and becomes a satellite jumping forward a couple thousand years into space where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon and next the film following a crew of space travelers mission as they follow the monoliths signal through space accompanied by their untrustworthy computer HAL who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew before finally the lone survivor is launched through space and time (in a flurry of drug-induced colors that probably gave hippies an epileptic shock back in the day) to grow old die and be reborn a Star-child. Whew.<br /><br />This pacing and emotional blankness is also in sharp contrast with the films most ironic scene; the destruction of HAL. As the crews final explorer shuts the machine down bathed in the holy aura of red light Kubrick has always used as a repeat motif HAL singing a lovely tune it is a strangely emotional experience. And its all genius.<br /><br />Other notable aspects of Kubricks masterpiece is the memorable voice of HAL (a calm somehow sinister Douglas Rain) the minimal use of dialogue (Kubrick was wisely trusting of his images to propel the film; giving only banal unhelpful lines to his actors. The most famous being Open the pod bay doors HAL) satellites dancing around in orbit to unorthodox music and that first awe-inspiring shot of earth; slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it played to the sound of blasting triumphant horns.<br /><br />2001 shall always remain a mystery and will forever be a testament to the cinemas strongest point: visuals are more powerful than writing. Its all from one of film historys most legendary and best directors whose unique vision was always his own. 10/10 <br /><br />Open the pod bay doors HAL-2001: A Space Odyssey',pos
'Only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be unredeemable I will state the following without repeating the obvious FLAWS plainly stated by some of the other commentators: The film is shot on video (what type of camera I dont know) but the cameraman had it on AUTOFOCUS(!) all the time so that any slight movement makes it go In and Out of focus. In many of the scenes the actors themselves go OUT of focus for their scenes. This alone screams Amateur.<br /><br />I also noticed that out in the middle of the cornfield you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is powering the lights ... loudly.<br /><br />Also what is with that single lighting source that follows (and many times leads the actors) when they walk around. It looks like a newscaster with that on camera light that follows the people around like a spotlight. There was no credit for lighting design/DP and I know why. The filmmakers saw no need to have someone who actually knew what they were doing lighting this picture (note I didnt say film). So be prepared for a SINGLE glaring spotlight as the sole source of cinematic lighting for most of the movie. UGhhh!!!<br /><br />This is probably the most technically inept production Ive ever seen commercially released. I bought this title because I like bad cinema. Usually its so bad that you can laugh at it. This is just so bad that its unwatchable. Plan Nine from Outer Space is Citizen Kane in comparison to this title.',neg
'A frustrating documentary. Louis Kahns son who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life. It sounds like a great idea for a documentary but it ends up flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />Sadly the basic problem is that Kahns son Nathaniel is not just one of the films protagonists --- he is also director writer producer interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles. Further while he seems like a nice enough guy he doesnt have much screen presence so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing. <br /><br />Nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer --- there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of Nathaniel offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid uh-huh as if hes a little panicked that hes going to have to come up with something to say in response. At times I felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about Kahn (or at least better things to do with their time) seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation. <br /><br />Nathaniels dual role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help. One senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of Kahns personality and career presumably because its not clear from Nathaniel whether hes looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his Dad -- preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his Dad really did care more for Nathaniel and his mother than seems likely. His passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict. The only person Nathaniel does push is his own mother but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama (Arent you ANGRY Mom?) and dont offer much in terms of helping us (or Nathaniel) understand Kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him. <br /><br />What the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand not to exclude Nathaniel but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. An independent director could have stood away from the material given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and one hopes cut out those portions of the documentary process that just dont work such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see Kahn die (which made it look as if Nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony) or the entire bit about hooking up with Kahns first cousin who had nothing to add about Kahn or Nathaniel. Too many times Nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a Kahn building buttonholing strangers to tell them that his father was the designer. (Ahhh huh. Thaaats nice sir. UmmI gotta go now.) I understand why these things might be important to Nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be TOO personal.<br /><br />As an aside I thought the score written for the film was great! (But one of the oddest moments in the entire thing for me was when during the tour of the Kimball Art Museum the voice-over quotes Kahn as making a comparison between architecture and Beethovens Fifth Symphony. The music being played at the same time? Beethovens NINTH Symphony. A mistake? A miscue? Who knows? It did make me laugh.) <br /><br />Kahn was a great architect and its clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story. Theres definitely a good documentary to be made about him. One is sympathetic to Nathaniels search for the father he didnt know but Im not sure whether THAT is an interesting story. Neither works so well in this film.',neg
'Without a doubt this is one of the worst pictures I ever actually paid money to see - the kind of flick you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a Christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for anything good but still are dead set on seeing a movie! And that is exactly how I came to see this stink bomb...<br /><br />At the distance of the better part of three decades I can still smell the rotting fish that constitute this story line. Unbelievable plot - that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual not of the sea - is laughable. And thats about all except for a completely out-of-place love theme that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is lovely (in a two dimensional role) but Richard Harris just chews up the scenery. He was no Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is no Jaws. Mercifully I have put most of it out of mind and when I run across it on television air casts I move on immediately. Danger Will Robinson! See the current t.v. commercial showing a husband and wife whale-watching (Orca - I love Orca...) - at least it is over in sixty seconds. This flick represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never get back.',neg

'Three Russian aristocrats soak up the decadence of Monte Carlo despite the fact they are down to their last franc. In order to support their lavish lifestyle the three use the services of a counterfeiter and use the notes at the casinos hoping to exchange the bogus currency for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes a US envoy arrives at Monaco with his wife Helen and the three decide to make pals with the visitors hoping for financial assistance. One of the three Russians Count Sergius Karamzin plans to go further with continuous advance towards Helen while disappointing the Counts maid who loves Sergius. Eventually circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats. Its obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the foolishness of American women and the improper behaviors of the aristocrats) rather than tell a story and the film really can bore modern audiences like me easily by doing that. Even the acting which is great in later EvS like Greed and the Wedding March is just run of the mill here. The film could have used improvements on various levels. Rating 3.',neg

Later he and the counts wife Countess Elga von Bruno (Rita Corday) fall in love for each other and with the support of Dr. Meissen (Boris Karloff) Sir Burton and the countess try to escape from the claws of Count von Bruno. The Black Castle is an excellent movie from a romantic time with action romance mystery and even horror. The story is gripping and is a great entertainment for any audience. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): O Castelo do Pavor (The Castle of the Fear)',pos
'This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. There was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and I am glad that Nolan picked to film it in black and white. The plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good along with the acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him for example saying everyone has a box which he put his personal things into. Also on the writers door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan would later direct Batman Begins and The Dark Knight two other great movies. There is a great twist in the end which Im not going to spoil for anyone who hasnt seen it even though I kind of figured what would happen when Cobb gave the young man D Lloyds credit card. I also liked how the writer had a copy of The Republic by Plato one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it plus it only being an hour long. There is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which I thought was pretty brilliant.',pos
'When I found the movie in the schedule for Christmas its title did not sound familiar to me since I have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film. Yet having read the content I decided to spend my Christmas evening on watching the movie. The effect surprised me totally: I do not remember when I last saw a film in which every single moment involved me. A VOW TO CHERISH is without any doubt one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise I have received from cinema. Here are some arguments of mine why I consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema. <br /><br />First the entire content is particularly educational. It has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions. Is there a need for Christ in our times? Does Love still matter? What for is there faith? What is the logics of burden and suffering in life? Is there really Someone by my side I can always trust? The movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us.<br /><br />Second the movie is exceptionally humane. The main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions. Is it better for Kyle David Denman) and Teri (Megan Paul) to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home? Is it better for John (Ken Howard) to leave Ellen (Barbara Babcock) his sick wife and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock) a woman he falls in love with? In fact Ellen no longer recognizes him... Yet he decides to vow HIS WIFE eternal fidelity. Had Johns rebellious brother Phil (D. David Morin) better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life. Phils prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity. These words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where when or how they live.<br /><br />Third the movie is a great portrayal of family not very popular nowadays: there are problems yet there is always something more powerful that gets these people together. This something is love and trust. I know that it may seem a bit idealistic. Not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that. Nevertheless it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one.<br /><br />Fourth the entire film focuses on peoples mutual help. If we want to live happy lives in our society we must understand one thing: we have to help one another. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of such attitude. At the beginning of the movie we see him talk to John about praying. Later he helps his brother. Alexander is a kinda angel that is sent to John and his family. Isnt it possible that we may become angels to one another?<br /><br />Fifth the artistic features are also worth attention. PERFORMANCES: Barbara Babcock gives an authentic performance as Ellen and although she has a difficult role she does a perfect job. Consider for instance the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again. Ken Howard is also memorable as the faithful husband. PICTURE: The most memorable for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves (autumn) while the sunshine (love) spreads everywhere. I interpreted as a sort of symbol: even if there is sorrow this can always be illuminated by light and joy...<br /><br />A VOW TO CHERISH is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe. At the end I would like to quote the profound words from the movie I found very touching and hope you will also do <br /><br />Kyle to his uncle Phil: Yes he (John Brighton) lives according to the Bible. But nobody forces you to do so. Yet according to what rules do you live?',pos
'The story for Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anands mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in Kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt Prem Pujaris posters. But the life of hippies re ignited a story in Devs mind to be made into a film.<br /><br />This was Dev Anands perhaps best directorial effort. The film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and Zeenat Aman as Devs sister made a tremendous impact.<br /><br />This film was Dev Anands call to the nation to keep up their moral values.<br /><br />It is about a Montereal based Indian family and the brothers role is a very affectionate one for his sister. But the parents quarrel and separate leaving Prashant(Dev) with mother and Jasbir(Zeenat) with father. She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see Prashant again.<br /><br />She is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home. Dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with certain hippies.<br /><br />To reunite with his sister Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti(Mumtaz) who was to later marry him and also Janice who in reality is Jasbir with a new name and new identity. She has forgotten her childhood and Dev too.<br /><br />Dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in Kathmandu and the people are after his life.<br /><br />This was a story well directed and acted-both by Dev Anand. We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz. But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman but Burman Da did not want Dev to do the film. He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari though was good but had been opposed in Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite peoples anger against Dev. But Dev continued with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film was indeed a success.<br /><br />R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing the award winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number.<br /><br />Overall it is a good film.',pos
'Paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. It does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.<br /><br />Unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife a conflict over a road construction project the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters a mysterious man who lives in the woods a bunch of racist hooligans at least three different carnivals the intricacies of local church politics and on and on and on. And all of that doesnt even include the actual central plot which is only about the hopes dreams and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. I was actually shocked when I realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours!) <br /><br />Ultimately the movie is melodramatic every plot point is predictable major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. Most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable twist) and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. Similarly a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another twist. Its all totally mechanical right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends (well not all of them just the ones the movie thinks you care about.)',neg
'Three young movie theater employees are given the task of re-opening a long closed old-time theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place. It seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own. As they approach the grand re-opening night things keep getting stranger and more unsettling with items suddenly starting to move around by themselves without any seen aid and a terrifying old man seemingly haunting the premises.<br /><br />Oh this is truly horrible. In fact if it wasnt for Mary Woronovs secretary character being such a fiercely independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy Selina this would be a total loss. The only other good thing I have to say about this film is some of the movie theater murders are done in truly inventive albeit not overly gory (a preference for me but not necessarily for others) fashion. The rest just wallows in constant sleaze (so extreme the rare few may actually find humor in it) and runs through the predictable slasher kills annoying characters off one after the other routine.',neg
'This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches. Sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending. But dont be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly. Only a little unexpectedly though nothing worth watching the thing through for.<br /><br />From the taciturn and wronged hero to the Germanic baddy to the expendable team the characters were entirely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (geddit?) gave some hope of humour but that came to nothing.<br /><br />I am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film. A turkey!<br /><br />',neg
'As you can see I loved the book so much I use the title for my internet alias and have for over 15 years.

Janet McTeer is great in everything else Ive seen of hers. I think she would have made a great Prue. And it even features early Clive Owen - from before Chancer (a great series itself).

'The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear then the silly set and finally every visible element of this film. Because theres nothing else there to show.<br /><br />Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. I dont really think they exist. I think they bought this script at Scripts-R-Us where you buy a standard blank Monster Movie script and just fill in the blanks. Theres a monster stalking us. Lets split up. (They actually lets split up in this movie). Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. Not dead yet. You know the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. <br /><br />What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. They psychological issues for the subject the deterioration of the mind due to the process treating an invisible subject and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting. Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the end it would have been a much better movie.

Its boring its low quality the actors are just the worst actors I have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that its hilarious.<br /><br />The main actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls but hes ugly overweight and looks like hes from the early 90s.<br /><br />All the characters are away for the week-end for a get together amongst friends but nobody are actually friends! The married couple hasnt seen the main guy in over 5 years and even back then they werent really friends. The date of the main guy only knows him from work and than theres a girl they pick-up at a bar. Now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week-end at your cabin with people that arent even your real friends.

'Silly comedy casts an embarrassed-seeming Ray Milland as a British officer in World War II Europe escaping German confines and taking up with a man-hungry gypsy woman played by Marlene Dietrich. Slowly-paced overlong and miscast: the leads are far too old for this type of juvenile fodder although Marlene shines in her solo moments. It took three scriptwriters to adapt Yolanda Foldes book for the screen but this material must have already seemed dated by 1947--it smacks of something Ernst Lubitsch might have turned out in 1939. The scenario is musty and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together. ** from ****',neg
'Ive loved this movie since the first time I saw it lo these many years ago. Im not sure how many times Ive seen it perhaps 10 perhaps 20. This last time I watched it I was struck by a detail that I hadnt noticed before.<br /><br />Toward the end of the picture the slain heroes are conveyed back to the town via sled. There are a couple of closeups of the dead men. The one that struck me most was a shot of the blond youth. All you see on the screen is his profile from head to hands. His hands are holding a flickering candle. The wind is blowing and his thick blond hair is dancing in the wind in tune with the flicker of the candle flame. The contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful. The moving hair and candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited his body.<br /><br />Every time I revisit this film I see something new.',pos

'Oh man what was Sam Mraovich thinking? What was anyone who was involved in this film thinking? Mraovich is the head of nearly everything of Ben and Arthur: Director writer producer (also EXECUTIVE producer!) caster lead star- you name it he did it. And he (Mraovich) sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making.<br /><br />So what is wrong with this film? Everything. The film is about two gay lovers Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovich- *groan*). Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people. To make things worse Bens crazy ex-wife (they dont exactly divorce) Tammy (Julie Belknap) is steaming mad that Bens left her for another man and demands Ben that they get back together (saying that she can be gay too!) and Arthurs Christian devoted excessively hypocritical equally batty as Tammy brother Victor is hell bent on making Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church.<br /><br />The film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs (ie. Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married- they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees; they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate plus many many more) and plot holes to boot (Victor calls killing Arthur The Final Plan which later changes to The Final Deed; Arthur and the private (intern) detective drive the same car blah blah blah). The actors are all very bad and are way way over the top; the script is laughably horrible(one such example is I dont make sense? You dont make sense! I make sense thats who makes sense!) and there so much more wrong with the movie that I cant write them all down.<br /><br />However the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about Ben and Arthur is that Sam Mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic (see his fake reviews for Ben & Arthur and obvious comments by him on YouTube.). Mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is.<br /><br />So to conclude forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever- Ben and Arthur will knock them right off that title even Paris Hilton movies look like The Dark Knight compared to the monstrosity known as Ben and Arthur.',neg
'Im not sure what it is but there seems to be some curse when it comes to films about the elusive Bigfoot. There has yet to be a film that intelligently approaches the subject nor one that creates any real suspense. Both Legend of Boggy Creek (1972) and the first film entitled Sasquatch (1978) have become minor cult classics but neither were very memorable. Both films were targeted at family friendly audiences thus inhibiting themselves from actually trying to scare anyone. Harry & The Hendersons (1987) was the first big budgeted film to use Bigfoot with a terrific creature design by Rick Baker. However they too chose to aim for younger audiences but this time as a comedy (as did Bigfoot in 1995). Ive long awaited for someone to tackle the subject as a thriller perhaps in the vein of Jaws or Predator. When I saw this at my local video store I thought my dream had come true. Boy was I wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who leads an expedition into the pacific northwest in hopes of finding his daughter as she was on board a small plane when it crashed in the mountains. The premise is interesting and sounded promising. The truth is it never builds any real suspense. I never found myself at all interested in any of the characters as each of them were very two dimensional and rather bland. Even the always dependable Henriksen seems to be phoning in his performance. Every time he appears on screen he looks plain bored. He should be as there is no action to speak of for the first hour of the film. As for the creature where do I start? I figured at the very least we would get a cool looking monster running around in the woods but instead we get this bald (yes I said bald!) man with pitch black skin and patches of fur here and there. Picture a cross between Swamp Thing and Chaka from Land of the Lost and youll get the idea. Nothing like the artwork on the cover box I assure you. Sloppy editing and careless direction also adds to the confusion as half the time everything seemed out of sequence while the other half of the film was constantly used up with these long slow fade outs (which made no sense or served any purpose). They even stole the whole infra-red vision P.O.V from the creature in Predator which just looked too silly and out of place to be effective. Maybe all this proves is that Hollywood should just forget about trying to make anymore Bigfoot films as they have yet to make one that works. So far each one has been as scary as an episode of In Search Of 3/10',neg
'Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor of all time he is without a doubt on others lists as well when it comes to great actors. He even pulled off a good Irish accent in Ordinary Decent Criminal as well. But Kevin Spacey as a Mafia leader? Or even a burglar? Im not so sure he could go that far. The movie to me just didnt make any sense and the some of the story just didnt feel solved to me.<br /><br />I know once again that IMDb is going to make me write ten more lines. But Im not so sure on what I could say about this movie because I am still trying to figure it out. Silly isnt it? But Im pretty sure that more than a few of you IMDb users have been in the same predicament as I am in right now where you just want to say a line or two about a movie but now you have to do ten lines?

'I would firstly say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood I couldnt read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I did really like the concept. If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie. That said having just watched the restored 137 minute version on DVD I have to say I enjoyed it though not as much as when I was seven ( I remembered the ending ). <br /><br />There are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism  the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music ( listen to the lyrics ). <br /><br />For an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll. By the ending of the movie I had decided that this was a good thing when seven I though the relationship guff was a bad thing.<br /><br />For an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of Shogun era warriors. The makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and lets face it humorous. I thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when I was a kid and I am not ashamed to say that I still do.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general dont spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum theyve got heavy calibre machine guns mortars rocket launchers a tank and a helicopter and theyre hell bent on making feudal Japan theirs. Which is what Id like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots.<br /><br />In short the movies worth watching it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like G.I. Samurai is so unique.',pos

'I signed in just to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is. Besides being a rip-off of Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist story this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. Its hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid cliché-ridden script to work with. Its bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence but when you find yourself groaning over and over again you have to conclude that the director also isnt the brightest bulb in the movie business nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place. The mostly low-rent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure not that being a part of this joke-of-a-movie is going to earn them any awards or recognition. It may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser. I see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case for to do so would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand. Just as studying well-made movies can inspire you how to make a good skillfully put-together work of art and beauty the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what NOT to do and what does NOT work!

'The movie Night Crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of East Germans during the period 1961-89. I lived in West Berlin during most of 1967 and travelled through The Wall into East Berlin on a weekly basis. Why? Excitement crossing a border into a Soviet governed country experiencing the smells and the feel of East Germany which is why Night Crossing is excellent it captures that very feeling and it is exciting. I was arrested by the Vopos in Checkpoint Charlie and accosted by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses I am led to believe was Stasi. When I watch the movie I can smell cheap diesel and cooking oil I can see the outdated vehicles the drab clothing the public wore and the lacklustre produce in shop windows. It brings back memories of realising just how lucky I was to live in a free country. In 1988 I toured the DDR from East to West North to South. East Germany had changed little since 1967. The Trabants constantly breaking down were still the main mode of private motorised transport the shops still featured nothing much to tempt me uniforms were still commonplace but the people the ordinary people were open and nice once you had gained their trust. Watch Night Crossing its as close to the truth as any movie you will see on divided Germany even closer than two other favourites The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Funeral In Berlin.',pos
'Le Locataire(The Tenant)is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made.Polanski stars as a Trelkovskya timid file clerk living in Pariswho answers an advertisement for an apartmentonly to find that the previous tenant attempted suicide by leaping from the apartment window.Trelkovsky is compelled to visit her in the hospital and there he meets Stella(Isabelle Adjani).Trelkovsky immediately moves in when the previous tenant dies andat firstis quite pleased with having found such a nice apartment.His happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbourswho seem to be trying to provoke Trelkovsky into repeating the previous tenants suicide.This film is great.Polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of dread and paranoia.Plenty of brilliant moments such as the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers the previous tenants tooth in a hole in the wallor the fever dream where he wanders into the buildings bathroom to find the walls covered with hieroglyphics.The photography by Sven Nykvist is truly beautiful.The Tenant is a neglected gem.It may be difficult to track downbut it is more than worth the effort.',pos
'There are two ways to turn a TV series into a film.<br /><br />The first most common and least successful is to basically make a feature-length TV episode- see the disasters of the Steptoe & Son movie. The second is to do something else- something quite different à la Monty Python.<br /><br />Thankfully the creators of the cult TV series have gone for the second option and theyve come up with something unique clever and funny- it couldnt feel less like a TV episode.<br /><br />Try to get your head around this- the writers playing themselves are confronted by their Royston Vasey alter-egos played of course by them and told to continue writing the series otherwise apocalypse will befall the village.<br /><br />High-concept contrived and easy to screw up? Yes but somehow they managed to pull it off. Not for every taste perhaps and the ending does drag but fans will be delighted and it might even win over the uninitiated.',pos

'Truly appalling waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minutes from the end. And i can count the films I have switched off before the end on one hand.<br /><br />The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. I wouldnt be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from 1983. For example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone. I mean seriously. The police would be beating his door down in minutes. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. Oh and what characters they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful. He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After 60 or so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is he happy? Is he sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless.<br /><br />The good guys are at best unlikeable. A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic ex-wife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy you arent going to shoot me that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying.<br /><br />The richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated.<br /><br />Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourkes? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! <br /><br />In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterisations and performances. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely dull. Its not even comedy bad either. Laughing at Rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the film.',neg
'The Desperadoes (1943) is a genuine classic not for its story (which is fairly routine) but for its technical production elements. This was a landmark western the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a Columbia production-a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation. Only Foxs Jesse James (also starring Randolph Scott) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre. Although it would be eclipsed in a few years by The Searchers and High Noon The Desperadoes was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure. <br /><br />In 1863 the economy in the town of Red Valley Utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the Union Army. The script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in Utahs future) and Custers Last Stand (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important plot elements. <br /><br />Red Valley has an honest sheriff Steve Upton (Scott) but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses. The town is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford) a famous outlaw who is an old friend Steves. He wants to go straight especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyennes partner Nitro Rankin (Guinn Big Boy Williams) is mainly there for comic relief as are Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the town judge (Raymond Walburn who models his character on Frank Morgans Wizard of Oz crystal ball faker). <br /><br />Taking no chances with their huge budget Columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but Indians and covered wagons. There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed a spectacular barroom brawl an explosive climax romance and three-strip Technicolor. All this stuff doesnt necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943. Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy. <br /><br />The cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming. The indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences. <br /><br />Scott and Claire Trevor were top billed but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford who would soon be their biggest star. And Director Charles Vidor utilized the film to showcase his new wife Keyes (whose portrayal of Scarletts sister in Gone With the Wind had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films). <br /><br />The Ford-Keyes dynamic is The Desperadoes most unique and important feature. Rather than go for the cliché love triangle with Scott and/or Trevor (which it first appears will happen) the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors. This was probably the best role Keyes ever got and she makes the most of it. Playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightleys character in Pirates of the Caribbean. This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the WAAC for WWII military service. <br /><br />The Desperadoes is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new. Unfortunately there are no special features on the DVD. <br /><br />Then again what do I know? Im only a child.',pos
'First let me say that those of you that voted it 10 are only kidding yourselves and trying to get the votes to a respectable level... something that this movie doesnt deserve. (The only movies deserving a 10 IMO are the classics... Godfather Shawshank etc. Look at the top rated films of all time for the complete list.) I also noticed that many people gave this a positive vote for being so realistic as far as what its like inside a cave. Though I would have to agree with them on the surroundings they simply arent rating the movie as a whole... they are infatuated by the surroundings but miss the overall review. That would be like me voting a 10 for the movie From Justin to Kelly because I think that the beach scenes remind me of what its like in the Florida Keys... though that may be true it does not merit the film getting a 10 because the movie as a whole was rancid.<br /><br />I wish I could tell you that something saved this movie as usually if one thing stinks in a horror flick something else picks up or makes up for the weakness. (Ex. - Bad actors are overshadowed by a great plot and/or great camera work and scenery.) We started the DVD and it all started out fairly normal. We jokingly started to pick out who would be the first to die... after a brief bit of driving and hiking they set up camp for the night. At that moment I keyed in on some things which really made me tune out the rest of the film. Two main problems I had: Bad effects and an even worse story line. The first thing that we all noticed was that the campfires werent real... you can plainly see the cgi or fake flames that they were all sitting at. For a horror film to have such a blatant effect flaw should have told me what I was in for the next hour.<br /><br />Only minutes later I was shown how poorly written this film was. I dont remember exactly how they arrived at the point but basically we find out that the token Nerd is writing a book about exploring caves etc. Another guy in the group wants to tell a story about an experience but hesitates stating I dont want this story in your book. The author convinces and coaxes the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him. (A direct quote: If I tell you the story you will definitely want it in your book.) At this point I was fully expecting a nice 5+ minute story complete with flashbacks and heartfelt acting. What I got was a short poorly told (and acted) statement. I say statement because what he ended up telling was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I dont remember the exact quotes but basically he says: We were in a cave the cave flooded a girl died as our friend watched her drown. You may think I am over exaggerating and being really critical but that isnt far off from a direct quote line for line from the movie scene.<br /><br />Over the next 50 minutes or so the film takes place in the cave and though the lighting is what I would imagine to be like in a cave I could have really done without the really fuzzy/hazy look to the film and the camera shaking is just one that I didnt go for. (I have really good vision and after watching the main parts of the film I felt like I was legally blind.) I was emotionally detached from this movie therefore the parts that probably should have been scary werent. Maybe had I been able to overlook the very slow and poorly acted start to this film I would have at least been scared but I dont remember anyone in the dark room even twitching at any of the action scenes.<br /><br />The last scene was probably one I will never forget and that isnt a good thing. Basically two women are trapped in a room naked. The monster comes in to attack/kill the women... he is stopped when he sees a picture of a little boy. A flashback occurs where we find out that the monster was injured as a little boy and spent his entire life in the cave. Cut back to present time and he takes his mask (a large skeleton with what appears to be a deerskin shirt). He glances at the picture and the two women appear to have found the cavemans weakness/soft spot. At that point he stabs and kills one girl then proceeds to rape the other woman rather graphically. After about 30 seconds of watching the camera jiggle and shake as he rapes her roll the credits movies over.<br /><br />Honestly if I had to do it all over and I wasted money on renting this movie I could have saved myself an hour and watch the first scene and last scene of this film and still left with the same thoughts about it that I have now.<br /><br />Those of you comparing this to Blair Witch are way off... if any of you had read up on how the director and writer ran the filming of Blair would realize how revolutionary it was... handing each cast member a script the day/night of filming without the other cast members knowing what the other actor was doing is genius.<br /><br />If IMDb would let me it would get a negative score... I dont understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie.',neg
'I typically dont like reality shows particularly the ones that are profiting off of American Idols success. But this one I can live with.<br /><br />Comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts and if they like them those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience. Then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do Survivor style competitions using comedic tactics. Then one will be determined as Last Comic Standing. I do like stand up comedy so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests. There are usually some pretty funny comics selected through. It started the careers of such talents as Alonzo Bodden Ralphie May and Josh Blue.<br /><br />My negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama. At first they lived together in a house like Big Brother but now theyve done away with that thank God.<br /><br />And there are a lot of comedians I felt were only chosen not because theyre funny but because of race ethnicity attitude sex etc. when other comics clearly shouldve beaten them out. But overall its a well-made reality show which are two terms up until now I thought were an oxymoron.',pos
'I bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart. I am glad I did. It was very entertaining listening to Sean Connery and playing the game. I thought the graphics were the best I have ever seen in a movie/game remake. The bonus levels were very hard! The sniper one I think was too hard it made me so frustrated I didnt play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. <br /><br />The only thing I might change was the upgrade system. I didnt notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded such as buying an armor upgrade didnt seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter.

Both he and Claire did an amazing job of hosting the show together. You could really tell that they both loved their jobs.<br /><br />The super-collector segments were excellent.

'The worst kind of film. Basically the US Declaration of Independence was replaced with a plasma screen and this fooled the museums security for several days. Eh?<br /><br />The plasma screen that would theoretically run for less than 2 seconds off that watch battery assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current which it wouldnt.<br /><br />It would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter but that system wouldnt fit into the case. Sorry to be anal but this isnt even close to being plausible. The rest of the film wasnt a great deal better and Im left wondering why the budget couldnt have been donated to charity or me.',neg

'Son of the Mask is a terrible excuse of a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we had seen Because of Winn-Dixie instead. I must say that it is partially my fault as I agreed to go see it with him. Being a fan of the first Mask movie (Jim Carrey was hilarious) I had hoped it wasnt as bad as all of the critics said it was.<br /><br />Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was headed for disaster. Disgusting and pointless attempts at being funny got little seven and eight year old children shrieking with laughter but the rest of us were left staring at the screen in disbelief.<br /><br />Finding the movie as repulsive and unfunny as I did is surprising to even me as I loved Scary Movie and Anchorman two films which many people I know found crude and offensive. But the thing is Son of the Mask is not funny unless youre under the age of ten.<br /><br />The film features lots of CGI in it but it cannot save this piece of rubbish. Whoever allowed this movie to make it to the big screen was probably thinking it had potential considering the success of its original. Unfortunately it has none of the laughs fun or excitement of the first creating a mockery of the original movie. I recommend renting the original Mask to anyone who is thinking about seeing this one. 1 star out of 10 is generous to this awful mess.',neg
'Absolute Beginners was a film for the younger generation a multi-time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in Britain and how these troubled constantly hitting each note teens problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow. It could have been dubbed the Moulin Rouge of the 80s but it disappeared. It made its very shallow mark on the world snuck under the radar and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section the comedy section or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesnt need chain money to survive. Alas that wasnt where I found it  but I found it watched it tried my hardest to sing along with it stared into Bowies eyes but found myself faded by the end. Did it not survive the test of time? Is 1950s London too far removed from our current society? Is Bowie too creepy? I think Absolute Beginners falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang but withers to a mere sparkle by the end.<br /><br />Absolute Beginners opens with a huge number that takes us through the non-gritty streets of London which involve theft nightly prostitutes on every corner dance throughout booze like rivers and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual. Sounds like a place we would all hate to be  right? Director Julien Temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters. The one we follow most is Colin played by Eddie OConnell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl Suzette (played by Patsy Kensit). These two have chemistry and while Suzette looks like a pre-rehab Lohan to me they worked. There was a huge spark between them the chemistry was like lava and I believed that these two could take me down a road I had never traveled. I was ready  but then something happened. Temple takes us out of the nightlife takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first. Suzette runs away Colin becomes a pervert and Bowie  well  I am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain  I can tell you that much. Temple gives us this flashy city this opportunity to see those that inhabit it but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger. We learn about Colin mainly but nobody else. I could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom and what importance fashion had to that era. Also were they teens really  they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s but maybe it was my TV.<br /><br />Character development thrown right out the door Temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about. One of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example. Temple uses a split house to show us the lives of Colins parents (of which I didnt know it was them until after the film) and a song which screams apathy. Great song too many characters not enough time suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency and it just falls apart in your hands. Then if that wasnt enough we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs rubbing our noggin trying to understand where our characters are or are going and Temple throws in hatred anger and politics into the final act. While I was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme I didnt think racism would be on the top of the bill. Suddenly friends are missing people are angry and there is some random guy running around fighting Colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race? Somebody help me out here. It seemed completely rushed and overwhelming  nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off. To me the ending of Absolute Beginners was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number. That first part set the pace and Temple could not keep up.<br /><br />Overall I must say that Temple can direct a music video but I dont think he was quite prepared for the feature film. I dont think this film will ever make it into full cult status and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come. It is a fun film to watch initially but when we get to that final part it just explodes from the inside. I wanted some cutting edge work but instead what I found was a freaky Bowie coupled with characters I cared nothing for. I could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s but by the end it just felt forced. I think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to Motivation by the ever-freaky Bowie in this film it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status. I am glad that I watched this film once but that is all that my small brain can take. I loved the way that Temple caught me from the beginning but he couldnt control his characters (way too many) and the songs didnt seem to match the final moments of the film. It came out of nowhere and it was unwelcomed. If this was a film about racism it needed to be from the beginning. Absolute Beginners was a welcomed adventure but I dont think I will be dusting this film off in the future.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****',neg

I am sad to say that I manage to watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything beyond that I will have to force myself real hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. Its totally stupid and very fake. The robot in the movie looks like a man wearing those steel suit and the acting is really bad especially the one playing the character Alien.He is totally annoying!! Dont waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Gen-X Cops. Id rather sleep or spend my money on some other things rather than watching this movie. 1 out of 10. If possibleId give 0.',neg

'I just finished watching this movie. I was very excited since Im a big fan of Punk Rock Horror films and Spoofs. I was very surprised at what I saw. I knew it was low budget but I wasnt expecting it to be taped with a video camera. It opens with a good song and a great very underrated band The Horrorpops reforming their song Where They Wander and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways. Its a great opening. But the problem is the fact that up until the end this was really all that the movie was. A live performance A death. Another live performance A death. It gets old. And there is a gross(literally) overuse of intestines in the death scenes. Why doesnt the killer use other body parts like legs or eyeballs or brains? Dont get me wrong this movie has some parts that are awesome. Like the hardcore French band known simply as BERET the prospect of a band named Atticus the scene containing a performance by members of the The Used and Simple Plan playing together since neither bands had enough members to play their show and Bowling For Soups Overweight-and-proud-of-it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner that I will save for the future watchers of this movie. But the big problem I have with this movie is the at first comical but after a while terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the actors. Especially Warped Tour creator Kevin Lyman. He tries very hard but I suspect that he didnt want to make the film but was contractually obligated or something. In addition to that the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the DVD. The Movies resolving plot is very hazy and very random. something about a magic sword and Lloyd Kaufman as the devil. Bottom line this movie has a lot of good qualities but not enough to be anywhere near a decent Horror Music or Comedy film. Although I have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that I would never have listened to otherwise. Such as Tsunami Bomb and the Phenomonauts(an insane Psychobilly band). I recommend that you rent this movie watch the first 10 or 20 minutes if you like it watch the next 20 or 30 if you still like it then watch on. If not just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances. They rock! Long live Punk Rock and Horror!',neg
'Never have I seen a movie like this; didnt plan on seeing it but it was worth the turn of the TV channel. I am mostly a scifi movie watcherbut I would be more than happy to add this one to my collection. It starts out as a one sided film with a simple love triangle then became something a little different(cant tell more then that. but it does involve two guys and one girl. juts not the way you would expect). Also this movie starred Hugo Weaving from the MATRIX and THE LORD OF THE RINGS in a role I would not have expected...very funny guy. This movie is playing on HERE TV but if you do not have satellite it is worth a rent. So give it a try; you wont be disappointed.',pos
'Elfriede Jelinek not quite a household name yet is a winner of the Nobel prize for literature. Her novel spawned a film that won second prize at Cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads. Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes?<br /><br />Gobble gobble is the favoured orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. In the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception. Gobble gobble and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners.<br /><br />The embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated. It begins very badly as if made to annoy the viewer. Credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress a stony professor of piano. She lives with her husky and domineering mum. Dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action.<br /><br />Reviewing The Piano Teacher is difficult beyond registering its unpleasantness. What we see in the film (and might read in the book for all I know) is a tawdry exploitative nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on.<br /><br />Erika whose name is minimally used is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed. Not quite because theres a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly-voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies. If a reviewer has to (yawn) extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do) Elrikas violently alternating moods would be it.<br /><br />A young hunk Walter studying to become a low voltage engineer whatever that is and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments is also a talented pianist. He encounters Elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In the glib fashion of so much art he immediately falls in love and starts to cherchez la femme.<br /><br />Repressed Erika has a liking for hardcore pornography shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches.<br /><br />Walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by Erika whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness hostility discouragement and humiliation.<br /><br />He soon declares his love and before long pursues Erika into the Ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control over her lovesick swain. She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges.<br /><br />In the meantime chillingly jealous because of Walters kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert Erika fills the students coat pocket with broken glass causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano-playing hands.<br /><br />The next big scene (by-passing the genital self-mutilation etc) has Walter turning up at the apartment Erika shares with her mother. Erika want to be humiliated bound slapped etc. Sensible Walter is for the moment repulsed and marches off into the night.<br /><br />At this point theres still nearly an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika tracks down Walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice. They retire to a back room. Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers. His baby gravy is soon expelled with other stomach contents. Ho hum.<br /><br />Repulsed but hooked perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor Walter returns to Erikas apartment. Can you guess what happens now? Its not very deep or difficult. Yes he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim. One moment hes locking maman in her room and slapping Erika the next hes kicking her in the face having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love. <br /><br />Am I being unfair in this summary? Watch the film if you want but Id advise you not to.<br /><br />Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if theyre in the right mood. I could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if I wanted. But I prefer not to because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing.<br /><br />Im supposed to say that parentally repressed Erika longs for love ineffectively seeks it in pornography inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears pink and throbbing under her nose belatedly realises that she doesnt like being hurt blah blah blah.<br /><br />The world has for reasons not explained stunted her. She apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist because thats his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise.<br /><br />At the end if you have the patience to be there theres a small twist. Before going to the final scene where shes due to perform as a substitute for the underwear-soiling student with the lacerated hands Erika packs a knife in her handbag. For Walter?<br /><br />Yes youre ahead of me. She stabs herself in a none life-threatening area and leaves. Roll credits.<br /><br />If this earned the second prize at Cannes just how bad were the rest of the entries?',neg
'Ive always liked Fred MacMurray andalthough her career was tragically cut shortI think Carole Lombard is fun to watch. Pair these two major and attractive stars together add top supporting players like Jean Dixon Anthony Quinn Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth give them a romantic script team them with noted director Mitchell Leisen and you geta mediocre movie experience.<br /><br />Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) meet cute during her visit to the Panama Canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skids a great trumpeter so he embarks on a musical career which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall. During his climb to musical stardom he neglects Maggie who later inspires him to start over after hes hit rock bottom. Ah yesits the true Hollywood happy ending which comes none too soon.<br /><br />Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success but this movie is so predictable and slow-paced that its difficult to watch at times. The early scenes set in Panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever and later an alcoholic Skid just wanders endlessly in New York. Fred and Carole try their best but the tired script and S-L-O-W direction just dont give them a chance. Even the final scene in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment just doesnt ring true.<br /><br />This movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars MacMurray and Lombard. However I guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours.',neg
'Some of the greatest and most loved horror movies have a wicked sense of humour but when a film comes along that isnt as original as the classics but just goes at it for laughs then a bunch of po-faced wanna-be critics completely slag it off. This film made me laugh aloud several times this is testament to the way this film was approached and it shows. The two main leads look natural and believable together and this really helps this film. You root for them the whole way and laugh along with them everyone has friends like both of these guys. Another highlight for me was the monster truck its awesome intimidating and really well shot. Taking inspiration (completely stealing) from loads of films the most obvious being Duel Jeepers Creepers and probably in reference to the Jack Black alike co-star Orange County. But really you can pick any road trip gone wrong movie and find a reference here. But so what its not trying to win any Oscars just give the viewer a good dose of frights and laughs and on that score its a 10! Obviously Its not getting a 10 I give real sensible reviews and scores unlike 99\% of the people on IMDb. There is no-way this movie can get a zero like so many lazy idiots give to too many films and as fun as it was it aint getting a 10 either. Its just a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humour and a liking for scares. You really cant get anymore simple than that.',neg
'This movie is just plain dumb. Dont bother watching it; believe me youre better off.<br /><br />Long and short of the plot: a defense attorney represents a man who murdered his son and other children. In defending him she comes across a wooden doll of Pinnochio. She takes the doll home. Pinnochio is possessed and begins to start killing people.<br /><br />This movie moves very slowly only to have such a weak ending. The plot is very bad and the Dennis Michael Tenneys musical score is pitiful. The story written by Kevin S. Tenney is just pointless and evokes NO horror or fear. This is a far cry from his work on Night of the Demons and Witchboard which are decent outings but nothing to write home about. His directing is OK but with such a bad story no one could have made this movie any good.<br /><br />In conclusion: 2 out of 10 perhaps the blandest most boring movie Ive seen all year.',neg

'Richard Schickels 1991 documentary about Gary Cooper - Gary Cooper: American Life American Legend gives us a look at the tremendous all-American star through his films and his life. Narrated by Clint Eastwood the theme is definitely Gary Coooper American as we are taken through fast clips of his many appearances in westerns and scenes from Meet John Doe Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Sgt. York. The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family as well as his childhood photos showing him as a beautiful blonde kid with the sunny smile he would have his entire life. There is also a hilarious clip of Cooper on The Jack Benny Show doing the comeback on the number Bird Dog - and Benny loses it. The documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous affair with Patricia Neal which nearly ruined both their lives.<br /><br />Theres a certain cohesiveness missing from this bio/retrospective - it jumps around a lot and has no footage of Cooper being interviewed which would have added a lot. Also Clint Eastwoods narration was described as unobtrusive. What it was was boring and monotone. Given that Cooper himself tended to be the strong silent type on screen we could have used a little animation.<br /><br />On a personal note Gary Cooper was one of the handsomest men who ever lived - there were some looks at him in his early films but not nearly enough for this fan. That smile those lips that bone structure - he was handsome throughout his life but in films like Morocco and Desire he is devastating. Instead of sitting through a scene from one of his worst performances as Howard Roark in The Fountainhead giving a speech that he admitted to the author he did not understand - a young suave Cooper in a tux would have been a nice touch. This documentary alas was definitely produced by a man.',pos
'Ever read Jim Thompson? Hes hard-boiled noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy Ive ever encountered. There are rarely private detectives in his work - just losers psychotics and small-time con artists. This film has Thompson nailed - If God made any real mistakes in this world it was in giving us a will to live when weve got no excuse for it. Every character in the film balances on a razors edge between surreal and creepy realism. Theres sleazy conniving Uncle Bud played by Bruce Dern and spookily well-intentioned Doc Goldman played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives a wonderful often heart-wrenching performance as Kid Collins a none-too-bright shy ex-fighter whos more scared of himself than of anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay the sexy femme fatale who we cant quite figure out...Its not your standard film noir nor is it intended to be.

'...here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm.<br /><br />Let me just say that I was BLOWN AWAY by this short film. I saw it randomly when I was in Boston at a film festival and I have thanked god for it every day since. I really truly believe I was part of a happening like reading a Tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of Mean Streets.<br /><br />I am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products but I so hope I can be there for it.<br /><br />Again a truly incredible piece of film making.',pos
'The Presentation is VERY shabby. (to my notion) as documentaries often are. Michael Moores documenatry - Farenheit 911 is FAR more convincing but has FAR too much media and political influence. Cant wait till Saturday when I get to see the docudrama The Game of their Lives . IFC goes right of center. I have started a collection of IFC movies from off the internet due to TGOTL *** out of ********** on Decade. Wanna see good documentaries? Stick to the History Channel.. Or try docudrama.

'Chuck Joness Hare Conditioned is a fast paced often hilarious cartoon. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a strange yellow-skinned apartment store manager who wants to have him stuffed Hare Conditioned takes full advantage of its multi-purpose setting. The chase takes Bugs and his pursuer through a variety of departments leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing whatever clothes are associated with that part of the store. This great gag is trumped however by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators in which Bugs disguised as an elevator boy tricks the store manager into relentlessly getting on or off elevators at the wrong time. Its a brilliant climactic set piece which unfortunately gives way to a not very funny final gag. By that time however Hare Conditioned has made its mark as one of the great chase films bursting with wild energy. As Bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons from this period Hare Conditioned showed that he could still be just as appealing as a more anarchic character.',pos
'A fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at Doing something about them when the chance strikes. Nothing was easy for Morris either-he had a family job job opps elsewheres a mortgage etc-it wasnt like he could just drop what he was doing and blithely hop on the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months. It took guts. I am glad that they showed his indecision almost up til he got the callup to the majors.<br /><br />I can remember seeing him pitch against the Red Sox(I think...) it was a great story. Though Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or a Mills Watson than Quaid-thats okay. <br /><br />Quaid does a very good job playing the man the teacher coach and oldest rookie.... As someone who is in the the same age group I certainly can ID with his plight. Youre not Quite too old to do what you had dreamed of as a kid but its getting there.

'National Lampoon Goes to the Movies (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made surpassing even the witless Plan 9 from Outer Space. The Lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes each featuring different performers. The only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Well maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice and hes right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets prettily in part one and part two respectively. But their glamorous displays are alas wasted. The directors seem to have forgotten that even T&A needs a credible story to surround it and theres none in sight.<br /><br />The third segment starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark is the most disgusting of the three and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this film. Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman brightly reporting for his first day of duty ready to rid the streets of evil. He is paired with an old cynical cop played by Widmark and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together we sense a possible redemption of the films earlier failures. Maybe just maybe the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partners stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. Maybe all will end happily after all. But alas this movie heads straight for the toilet with no redemption no happy ending no coherent story of any kind.<br /><br />Before National Lampoon Goes to the Movies I thought I had already seen the worst schlock that Hollywood could possibly turn out. Unfortunately I hadnt seen the half of it.<br /><br />',neg
'This film is a fine example of why the Shaw Brothers are among the finest directors (probably the best in the Kung Fu category). The movie is well paced the story is excellent and intriguing and while the humor may not be in your face it is nested within the character interactions. Once the story builds up and the characters begin to assess the situation does the whole tower come crashing down in one of the best fight scenes (tiger crane and crab Hung Gar are very present). There is even a scene that mocks 18th century Western social events and ends with clever and entertaining fighting. The movie ends with a sudden cheesy moment but if you are a fan of the Shaw Brothers youll understand that the cheese is just a topping and not the main course of the movie.',pos
'After his earlier movie Videodrome which definitely shows similarities to this movie director David Cronenberg again ventures himself in the world of virtual reality in which truth and fiction mix. Its virtual reality taken to a whole other level.<br /><br />eXistenZ is an highly original movie that is well directed and acted out but above all very well written. The movie features a fascination and well thought out concept which gets greatly executed by director David Cronenberg.<br /><br />eXistenZ is a movie that knows to constantly fool you. Just when you thought you figured things out another surprise awaits around the corner. Things are never like how you think they are especially when the line between truth and fiction gets explored. You just never really know what is the reality and what is the game-world right till the ending. It makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and also provides the movie with a great ending that will leave you thinking even more.<br /><br />The movie has a perfect kind of game-play storytelling mostly with its character appearances and its puzzling events. They have to complete a certain step or task first before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is.<br /><br />The movie knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism without ever going over-the-top with either one. The storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible though of course the movie isnt always that simple to follow because of its events dialogs and unusual environments.<br /><br />The movie is not only just weird though. I was actually surprised to see that Videodrome has an higher rating on here thought its a far more inaccessible and odd movie. The movie is also still made entertaining and has a good fast pace. It doesnt ever allow the movie to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this movie perfectly watchable for people who normally dont watch this sort of movies.<br /><br />The movie is good looking with subtle effective special effects a great visual look that also provides the movie with a certain required gaming feeling.<br /><br />The movie is well cast with Jude Law in a role you dont too often see him in that of a shy insecure person. It once more shows how actually versatile Law as an actor is and that he is way more than just another pretty face from Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Leigh also was a great female lead. She hasnt really played ever that many big parts in big productions but with this movie she shows why she nevertheless always have been regarded as a big movie star. The movie also features some other well known actors in much smaller roles such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe.<br /><br />An highly original movie that is well worth watching especially if you have seen Videodrome previously.<br /><br />8/10',pos

'I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it moved along well. The director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one coming out today obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. The acting was pretty good the F/X and stunts were well done. A couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that turned out OK.',pos
'I too had waited a long time to see this film. As far as I know it has never been released in Australia so in the end I found a copy on the net and ordered it through there. Weeks after my order confirmation it finally arrived and I was extremely excited to finally be sitting in front of my TV ready to watch a film that sounded so interesting and controversial and filmed in an area of the world where so many good movies are. What a disappointment. Within the first few minutes I realised Id ordered a B Grader but was still full of expectation. I convinced my son (18) to watch it with me as I love sharing when I find a movie of value with good underlying statements and/or story lines. About half way through he got up and said he couldnt stand watching it any longer it was so predictable and amateurish. I agreed but watched to the end. The acting was atrocious even for B Grade standards. The stereotyping also predictable and I feel for the good folks of Lake Arthur Louisianna who mustve cringed after seeing the film depicting them in such a way. No doubt some racial prejudices still exist in many parts of the world not just the States but really in this day and age I doubt theyd get away with all the ridiculous alibis presented in this. I had to double check the date the film was made as their attempts at gimmicky filming of the more gruesome scenes was something Id expect from a high school students first attempt at making a film indy like. Id like to see this film put into the hands of experienced scriptwriters and film makers its an old tale but one that could still pack a punch if dealt with professionally. So disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations. The soundtrack was probably the only thing I enjoyed.',neg
'Did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads. Like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes. I can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work.<br /><br />I also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie. I think that if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie. If however you find his work/not funny then I would recommend staying away from this one.',neg
'Definitely one of funny man Eddie Murphys lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child three hundred year old dragons and a Chosen One.<br /><br />Murphy is the Chosen One in question and as the opening song suggests he is the best man in the world. A finder of lost and missing children he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him he is The Chosen One and that it is his destiny to find and rescue The Golden Child. For if the child were to die compassion would die with him as he is the bearer of compassion.<br /><br />If all this hocus pocus rubbish hasnt ruined it for you now it surely will once the movie begins. Suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film. Meant to be another vehicle for Murphys egotistical brand of humour (the comedy isnt so great mind you) the movie fails on many levels. Even Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa cant do much for proceedings. Very silly and disappointing.<br /><br />Sunday December 12 1993 - T.V.',neg
'Deranged and graphically gory Japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg-zombie like machines- which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected.<br /><br />Technically superb horror comedy(?) is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying. Good taste prevents me from describing what happens here but lets just say its pretty gruesome. If you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film. Personally Im not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level. Here I was intrigued enough that I can suggest it to people I know who like really gory movies.. Its also a film with enough going on in the details that I want to see it again since now that I know what was going on-as revealed in the end-I want to go back and see what it was I didnt catch on to. There is an internal logic rare in these films.<br /><br />7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else.',pos

'I pulled down a VHS box from my vast collection - many unseen - and picked out a movie based on the box art I thought would be fun and yes bad. Prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box. I sat down and watched and lo! and behold! found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind. Fortunately I reversed mine quickly and soon realized I was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total. Prison tells the story of an old dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns. It looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners. The prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film. The story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair. We see Lane Smith as a guard - tearing away a Crucifix before sending the man to his Maker. We then go to present day first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she campaigned vigorously against re-opening the old prison. Then we see the new warden Lane Smith haunted by a nightmare in bed - and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years. Well the rest follows suit: prisoners and guards arrive with plenty of stereotypes abounding. We are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters. The acting is better than one might expect with Lane Smith doing as always a workmanlike job. Viggo Mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid. Tom Everett Tiny Lister and Ivan Kane really exploring the boundaries of their stereotypical characters. Chelsea Field is okay as the female lead. The best performance is by Lincoln Kilpatrick an underrated character actor as Cresus - a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the man had been executed with some kind of terrible secret. Prison is not the next best thing to sliced bread or anything like that but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it. I was pleasantly surprised at the way director Renny Harlin created a story so visually atmospheric. The film has a tense taut pace and Harlin knows how to build his scenes. There are a few excessively shot gore scenes - the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes. But these scenes are visually creative and interesting. The acting is uniformly decent. The script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these. That may in part be credited to Irwin Yablans who wrote the story. You may remember he came up with the idea of making Halloween scary as a holiday. Here he makes incarceration a hell of a lot more scarier than it already is. Give Prison a break(get it).',pos

'When I went to the video rental store back in the days when DVD was yet next to unknown to me I had seen all the movies at the store that I was interested in. Or so I thought! The man behind the counter told me he had something for me that I definitely would like. He gave me Plunkett and MacLeane. At first I doubted it to be any good but I trusted his advise and... man I sure am happy I did take this jewel along! This is one of the best adventure movies in years if you ask me! Of course with Robert Carlyle as a major part how bad can a movie get? Surely Liv Tyler does once more what shes good at and nothing much more: being pretty.

'Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely.<br /><br />The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. The 13th Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. Existenz is not an action movie at all and is not (as many seem to believe) about reality or any such deep concept. Its about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe.<br /><br />The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats her scripted line. Its at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story. This is made even more frightening at the end when DArcy Nader (or rather his player) comments on the possibility of spending ones life in the game. I sympathize completely with the realist philosophy that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence. Living in the game is not living at all but is a tempting way to spend ones time on earth. As Allegra comments about the real world theres nothing going on here. Might as well jack into someone elses imagination and pretend to be doing something interesting. (Although I have to ask whether Cronenberg considers this a self-indictment considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in 90 minute snippets.)<br /><br />Upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended. But having seen it a couple more times (thank you SciFi Channel) Ive realized how much deeper it goes. Seriously if youve only seen it once it deserves another viewing.',pos

'This is the first time I feel the need to comment on IMDb to write some sort of a review and as it so often happens its not because of a really excellent film but a truly appalling one.<br /><br />Take the narrating style the youngest might relate to the Max Payne video game series a cast of virtually unkonwns (which is not a bad thing in itself) poor dialogs some dark scenes but not many enough and make a film out of it. Dont worry about the bad acting the length (way too long) the lack of immersion (the lead character has to be one of the lest interesting Ive seen in a long time - couldnt care less if he died) or the often ridiculous solutions they find to certain problems the lead character finds himself in.<br /><br />I wouldnt have written anything if it hadnt been for another review here giving it 10 stars. I gave it four but maybe three is closer to what I feel about it. Not only do I not wish to see it again but the mere thought of it takes me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself. Oh and a so called noir film is nothing without a good soundtrack - not the case here. The ending song sounds like it was more suitable to a western movie.<br /><br />Its not romance its not action its not noir its not good.

'I love Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />And I enjoy 99\% of all movies I see.<br /><br />And I walked out of this one.<br /><br />Now I admit it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing (Oh no Jamies knocking on a door! HEE HEE HEE!) but... this was just so incredibly annoying. There could be no sustained camera shot and no camera shot from a conventional angle... everything had to be in-your-face loud and annoying.<br /><br />The bad guy tried to be smooth and Malkovich-like but at this point its just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. From all the characters too many lines you saw coming too many youve heard before and too many tough guy lines... and I dont mind that sort of thing really as long as theres a bit of originality to it. In fact pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked.<br /><br />I love Jamie Foxx and I think hes really funny and I thought he was funny in this movie... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else. <br /><br />This movie needed less shoot-em-up less annoying camera shots more emotion more feeling and more Jamie Foxx.

'(SPOILERS IN FIRST PARAGRAPH) This movies anti-German sentiment seems painfully dated now but its a brilliant example of great war-time propaganda. It was made back when Cecil B. DeMille was still a great director. (Ignore all his later Best Picture Academy Awards; he never made a very good sound film.) This movie lacks the comedy of most of Pickfords other films and really it was DeMilles movie not Pickfords. The vilification of the Germans can be compared to the way The Patriot of 2000 did the same to the British. The only good German in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of Austreheim. They even had Pickford take an ill-fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a German submarine. So whatll get the Americans more stirred up to war? The sinking of the Lusitania or watching Americas favorite Canadian import sinking in it? All throughout the film DeMille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another barely escaping death hypothermia depravity rape execution and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed. The way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in Jurassic Park were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors. If I was any more gullible to such propaganda I would punish myself for having a part-German ancestry. <br /><br />Was it a good film? Aside from a humorous running gag about Americans abroad thinking theyre untouchable  that was apparently a joke even back then  you might not be entertained. Youll find it more than a little melodramatic and obviously one-sided but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before Potemkins false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movies potential for propaganda. It made me wonder: what became of Cecil B. DeMille? Somewhere between the advent of sound and The Greatest Show on Earth he seemed to lose his ambition. Ben Hur looked expensive but not ambitious. In a sentence this movie is for 1) Film historians 2) Silent Film Buffs 3) Mary Pickford fans or 4) DeMille fans if such a person exists.',pos
'Ive seen Directors Cut version and can be nothing but content. Excellent acting (esp. Cole Hauser I was sad about little space for Claudia Black though) subtle visual effects and photography in overall believable plot (considering the genre) without a lot of logical holes really non-predictable twists build-up characters. These are the greatest assets of the movie. Combined with style - some may consider this movie a B-grade effort but I would disagree with that. The whole thing really is very original and stylish.<br /><br />And even though Im not a fan of Vin Diesel this tough guy role of Riddick suited him well.

The breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in Breakin but I have to say that Breakin 1&2 carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better.

'I was attracted to this movie when I looked at cast list but after I watched it I must admit that I felt a bit disappointed. The main problem of this movie is that actors arent capable of holding this movie on their back. Why? Because of bad script. Although Dillon Lane and Jones try very hard to take this movie on another level there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. So for Matt Dillon fans this is watchable movie just like for admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great but this is not movie for him; far below his level. So if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but dont expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing that youll remember about this flick is Diane Lane scenes; rest of it is very forgettable.',neg
'I saw this movie on the film festival of Rotterdam (jan 06) and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards. Many people reacted shocked and protesting. He will get a lot of negative critics. But: the world is cruel like this and its not funny. People dont like it. That itself doesnt mean that the movie is bad. I can see that difference. Dont shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our hubble! Nevertheless I think this a bad movie. Film-technically its a good one. Nice shots and script most good fitting music great actors. The director pretends to make a psychological movie - the psychology however is of poor quality. Describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art. The art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence. How does a shy boy come to such a cruelty? The director pretends to describe that - but is not good in that.<br /><br />The director used several times the word the selfishness of people mentioning for instance the teacher. Only: this teacher wasnt selfish- just someone in several roles caring for his pupils ánd worried about his script. I think its a simplification to call him selfish. The atmosphere in the village is creepy and the mother made awful mistakes (you terribly let me down) but it doesnt become believable for me that there is caused súch a lot of pain that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things. In fact reality is far more complex than the way this film describes  and it needs far better descriptions. The interesting thing would be: how does it work? Describe that process for me please so that we understand.<br /><br />With the written phrase on the end the director said to point to an alternative way of life. It was the other extreme and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists promoting black/white-thinking. The connection between violence in films and in society has been proved. Use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right. There are enough black/white-thinkers in the world causing lots of war and misery. I hope this movie wont be successful.',neg
'First let me be honest. I did not watch all this movie. I watched the first five minutes and when i realized that I had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that I may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on... It didnt. This film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become: a decent horror movie. Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made. This film isnt and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it. Lastly I feel it is important to say that I think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you wont need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung.',neg
'Far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30s and 50s. George C. Scott was born to be Scrooge just as he was born to be Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. The character of Scrooge as played by Mr. Scott seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought an richer more robust yet a more deeply moving Scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century London. Mr. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal understandable yet highly conflicted level; his role was acted with the great authority Scott always bring to the screen: yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper almost as a soliloquy as he would berate the Christmas holiday in one breath yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line.

'This movie was on the pay channels today and I had nothing to do so I had it on. This has to be the worst football movie ever made. This has to be one of the worst movies period. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system and they gave 2 stars out of 4. This movie isnt even a half a star. Bad acting Scott Bakula sinks as usual Larry Miller?? Sinbad couldnt act if he tried. Rob Schneiders one liners completely stunk. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie. The only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see Kathy Ireland nude in the shower not even close. A complete waste of time and of film. If we could give a negative number minus 9.',neg
'The second of the Why We Fight Series concentrates on Hitlers grab of the Sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of Neville Chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of Europe. <br /><br />Clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the Allied bias turning out to be historical fact. The Fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves East. The Czechs and Austrians quickly capitulate but the Poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds. <br /><br />The disparity between Hitlers military might and Chamberlain waving the Munich treaty like a white flag declaring Peace in our time to this day has durable propaganda qualities. Here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of World War ll sets in on Europe leaving the American viewer with two options freedom or slavery. In 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and The Nazis Strike makes its point effectively.',pos
'The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work. In fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.<br /><br />At least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning. Black gore is hardly frightening nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp Lugosi style.<br /><br />The narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine Naked Lunch directed by Russ Meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque. Otherwise give this film a wide girth. Bava and Argento fans - once again - are bitterly disappointed.',neg

'I dont know where to begin so Ill begin with a snippet from the back of the cover of this movie. Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natalis Cube with Kitamuras own Versus. I have not seen Versus so I cant comment on that but I think Cube was an excellent movie which I recommend to everyone. However in this case someone has clearly confused tension with boredom.<br /><br />Ill just go ahead and spoil the entire plot because besides being one holy Swiss cheese of a plot its also moldy cheese and the movie is not worth spending any time on even if you dont know the plot beforehand so it doesnt matter. If I have misunderstood the plot dont hit me - its probably because I had to struggle to keep my eyelids open.<br /><br />So the American military in Nevada once lost a UFO i the Nambi desert. This apparently makes sense because theyre both deserts so surely theyre practically the same place. Different continents or not. A monkey broke into the UFO and acquired an alien something which was passed on to a Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert. What ever. The alien thing is now passed on to anyone whos bloodthirsty enough to kill the current host. The Japanese military wants to use it for military stuff so they decide to make it pass from the current host (the researchers daughter) to some other dude. But instead of just picking someone out of the military which is full of people who are bloodthirsty AND already on the militarys side they decide that its probably a good idea to pick some criminal out of death row instead. Oh and the reason they pick this particular criminal from death row is because he was the first person in history to not die from the non-lethal electric shock which is the standard execution method because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they get electrocuted. I dont know if they do this so they can giggle in the staff room at how everyone dies even though its not deadly or if they just want to cut down the electricity bill.<br /><br />Then the movie turns into what The Matrix would have been if it had been really lame and superfluous fighting bores us to tears for what feels like an hour. And oh wait now they remember that they already had a dude who was infected with the alien thing so the entire movie up to this point was actually a totally waste of time and also human lives. Then everyone dies. The end.<br /><br />The only one moment in the movie where I didnt want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich instead was when a dude was pinned to a wall by a pipe through his chest and hes hanging around up there and another dude walks by. The dude hanging on the wall says Im in pain shoot me. And the living dude looks at him and its not like hes a mean dude or anything so he really looks sorrowful and doesnt want the guy on the wall to suffer. So he shoots him.<br /><br />(Rhetorical pause.)<br /><br />In the stomach. Gee THANKS A FREAKIN HEAP.',neg
'I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga compelling storyline cool soundtrack directing (Kitamura rocks!) editing and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2 but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket:( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off however these are completely 2 different movies. The pace is a lot slower the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if that is possible!). I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment. There is however some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. Even the real bad guys get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam!! Azumis rampage at the end was unconvincing but Aya still does an okay job. She looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from? I dont think i will be watching this one over and over again! ...what a pity.',neg
'Indian Summer is a warm multi-character film that would make a fine afternoon film (with a bit of editing).<br /><br />The film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present when a group of adults from the golden age of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp Uncle Lou. The film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp and form new memories in their latest stay.<br /><br />The film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments. Watching these people reminisce and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well. It never goes to over the top and melodramatic always keeping its warmth charm and realism. Ive never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself.<br /><br />For a warm nostalgic character movie I sincerely recommend.',pos
'This movie has recieved horrible ratings from just about everyone who has voted here but i am here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres my Car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you.

'How does this movie suck? As a fan of Michael Imperiolis work on The Sopranos I picked this up at Blockbuster based on his name and a story that sounded like it had promise. It still does but this movie doesnt fulfill it.<br /><br />Every turn of the story is entirely predictable; I kept looking for the Lifetime bug on the bottom right corner of the screen. Its all there: the noble woman coming out of hard times the guy failing to live up to his potential despite her best efforts the kid who gets stuck in the middle etc. etc. etc. The mysterious strangers identity is what really made me want to throw stuff at the TV -- I would have been more satisfied with little Stuey waking up and realizing it was all a dream.<br /><br />The filmmakers may as well have had a The moral of the story is... bit before the credits since as another reviewer pointed out this thing really does roll like an afterschool special. Dont gamble dont drink dont do drugs stay with your wife spend time with your kids...come on how about a little nuance? How about some interesting bad guys? Writer/director A.W. Vidmer should be singled out for special notice: not only is the dialogue leaden the pacing (within dialogue and at either end of many scenes) makes this movie at least 45 minutes longer than it needs to be (and believe me it feels like longer). The talents of Imperioli Renee Faia and some of the supporting cast (Steve Schirripa natch) are the only things that keep this from a 1 rating. All of their good work is nearly offset though by the atrocious job of portraying the boy Stuey. Not sure if it was a casting mistake (hey -- its a mob movie so lets cast someone from Blues Clues who cant do anything but over-overact with a big fake grin...next lets cast the sullen brooding kid in the Disney flick) or just awful directing but those scenes are really painful to watch.<br /><br />Id be interested in another filmmakers take on this character and his story; its a shame Imperioli has already been used up by this flick. Awful awful awful.',neg

'Utterly pretentious nonsense. The material is dull dull dull and most of the cast wouldnt even have made understudies in Allens earlier films. And to have to listen to the unfunny Will Ferrell do his Woody Allen imitation makes me loathe the second-rate (though mysteriously popular) Ferrell even more. It appears that the morose 70-year old Allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new century.<br /><br />I truly tried to get involved in the film but it was just impossible; my snyapses couldnt fire that slowly. So rather than doze off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position I got up left my wife and daughter in the theater and went out to the car where I had a really good book to re-read (George Baileys great tome of 30 years ago Germans.) The day turned out pretty well after all no thanks to Woody.',neg
'Simply put I was amazingly disappointed. Im a huge fan of Asian Horror and I can watch unoriginality (I myself enjoyed The Red Shoes and Phone) but this was just poor.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of elements that are very high-quality: the photography is eye-catching the visuals are cool the directing is inspired the acting is pretty good the music is easy on the ears and the CGI is incredible. But since this is a horror film we are expected to be scared which just wont happen with this film. As with most South Korean horrors this is unoriginal almost from beginning to end: theres the trademark long-haired vengeful female ghost ominous clumps of thick black hair and puddles of water and near the end a twist that *almost* but not quite makes sense out of the whole thing (the twist is easily one of the best qualities). And to the viewers irritation when the film isnt recycling (at times so exact that it could easily be dubbed plagiarized) imagery from other movies its making you jump. A lot. And by jumps I dont mean things jumping out or anything just VERY loud noises and screeches in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air (theres even a few made-you-jump moments that are simply infuriating). And when it is not ripping-off other movies its boring and hard to sit through.<br /><br />And its a shame because Ryeong could have easily been really good and it has everything to make it good but its the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and jump scares that eventually ruin the movie. A perfect example of how good it could have been: theres a moment when one of out characters is looking at a corpse and without a sound the corpse looks back. Its wholly predictable but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant. And unfortunately thats as scary as the movie got for me.<br /><br />Admittedly Ryeong has a few good features and even a couple jumps that arent as predictable and do work. Theres a very good and sad back-story used to explain the events and the twist is pretty unpredictable. Those are the only things that separate the film from any other Asian ghost/horror film. But the problem with these is even though they do work they have been used before (J-Horror fans will easily realize the big reveal was inspired by A Tale of Two Sisters) and it takes the back-story a good fifty minutes to get going.<br /><br />So in the end Ryong really seems like a truly wasted opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features act as diversions so the audience wont notice the huge flaws. But he failed and well... We noticed everything.<br /><br />My rating: 4/10.',neg
'I have really nothing to add to all the other comments save this: To me the film looked like a silent film slowly being adapted to sound. The text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression I suppose. Along the way the actors were allowed to leave the stilted theatre-like acting; Marguerite Churchill very much looks like a typical early silent movie heroine at the beginning of the film but at the end is allowed finer expressions. Gus the Swede? reminded me of the comic characters of Shakespeare plays and Windy sounded to me like an early Donald Duck.<br /><br />It truly amazed me that it was all filmed outdoors on location and even though the dust of all the wagons horses and cattle obscured the view it must actually have been like that for the real settlers! It also was clear to me that many of those Indians must have been real and I didnt detect any overt racism towards them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a real Wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy by John Ford and thought that Stage Coach was Waynes first as a leading star this film was a revelation. The plot is very simple again reminding me of a silent film but the grit is very real indeed! An amazing film to have been made with that technique and under those conditions in 1930.',pos

'When I first watched this we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times. Weve just watched it again and I liked it MORE than I did the last time Id watched it!! :) :()<br /><br />The film is mainly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!) . Charlie is half a gangster and half a goodie which I like. Itchy is his sidekick. Charlie is killed by his friend (NOT) and sent to heaven. When Charlie comes back to life it is the start of an amazing adventure.<br /><br />The five main reasons why Im absolutely CRAZY about this film: One: I love the characters (except Carface). My favourite three are Charlie Itchy and a little girl called Anne-Marie who comes slightly later. Two: I love the period of history in which this film is set. It is set during the prohibition in the United States. Three: The Don Bluth animation (as usual) is superb. The backgrounds are good too. Four: There is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: The songs in this are lovely. My favourite song starts with I need Brazil the throb the thrill...<br /><br />So watch this lovely film when you can you wont be disappointed! :) ;) :()',pos
'This film is a very beautiful and slow film. There is nothing Hollywood about it. It is very danish and the characters are very real. It is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme. It is really about love that has no gender. I would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters (the transsexual veronika and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It is a story about love and life.<br /><br />The story pretty much takes place in the two apartments. There is almost no background music which makes it seem more real and intense. The two actors playing the main characters are great. They really make them seem real. They are not archetypes but real people you could meet in the street. I think it is the first time I have seen a transsexual portrayed this well. Very well done.',pos
'SWING! is an important film because its one of the remaining Black-produced and acted films from the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable but this one is in fairly good shape. Its also a nice chance to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old Cotton Club--a time all but forgotten today.<br /><br />Unfortunately while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances its also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. However the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit demeaning. This is because before the plot really gets going you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who by the way totally overplays this role) they have a fight which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! Later in the film when the prima donna is behaving abominably her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems like the film at times wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS they cant even do this well--with some of the worst acting Ive seen in a very long time.<br /><br />Still if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters bad acting and direction and poor writing) this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten Black culture. Just dont say I didnt warn you about the acting--its really really bad!',neg

'I agree with the Aussies comments for the most part. However there id seem to be a fairly decent plot if unoriginal. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge. She gets reacquainted with Chip (Bobby Johnston) whom she had known when she was growing up in there. The plot thickens when James (Paul Logan) arrives with his new stripper friend Shene (Devinn Lane) because Christina had been James stripper friend in years gone by and the implication is that James had done her wrong somehow. To add interest to the movie Sophia Linn (Monique Parent) a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the lodge as do Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (Flower) pair of lawyers from the city. James sicks the local building codes inspector on Christinas business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down. So the question is How far will James go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed?<br /><br />Watch for Devinn Lane here and in Beauty Betrayed.

'This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew a narrative depth superior to most novels wonderful music philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations including the Edgar Reitz office. From then on I vowed to improve my German skills - after Die Zweite Heimat I feel almost German as if I am in the head of the characters. I also try to match the piano playing of Henry Arnold (Hermann) but this is the one thing that will always elude me ! This drama is unparalleled and I have been fortunate to see it on BBC2 in the UK and SBS in Australia. The sequel Heimat 3 is currently being filmed in Germany.',pos
'Have you ever watched a film when after its conclusion your left pondering what in the world it was all about? Well say hello to Scream Baby Scream. Its not that the storys complex or anything like that its just that it plays out in three completely different modes...1. A fun 60s drug movie...2. A much overplayed soap opera...and 3. a horror flick (with very little to Scream about). Much to my surprise Ive found out that it was written by one of my all-time favorites Larry Cohen. Well I guess even the best have to learn through trial and error.<br /><br />Playing out much like something from H.G. Lewis(only with lesser fx) this bad film does have its perks. For most of its short running time theres a pretty cool jazz score to be heard and there are a couple of memorable scenes...one of those being where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice long motor bike ride to the zoo. The camera tricks the director uses to indicate their hallucinatory state is just plain retarded but amusing. Trust me when I tell you theres no need to run out of the house to catch this one!',neg
'Especially if you love horrible movies. When I first started watching it all I could say was I hope theres a dance sequence in it. Imagine my delight when not ONLY did the two main characters dance but the main ghost began break dancing as well. AND on top of THAT Sherman Hemsley sings the break dance song (not to mention the theme song). It makes me a little sad that he went broke because of this movie but Ive never liked him as an actor and he really should have known better. Not even the director would take credit for this movie (and you should check out some of the other films he directed!).<br /><br />One note of warning though the writer seemed to really like jokes about the um male lower regions. For example one of the characters discovers a book called Groins of the Darker Species. I am not kidding. And that to me is the most disturbing part of the film. Other than that find the most obscure video rental store in your town get the movie invite all your friends over and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.',neg

Why would you ever consider giving this pile of horse **** a 10. You can say its worth a 10 for the sheer comedy of it but when you vote on a movie thats not supposed to be a comedy you cant give it a 10 for comedy. You have to rate it on what it was supposed to actually be like and not for something the director wasnt intending. Maybe some of you voted 10 cause you thought it would be funny to have this crappy movie have a high rating so that people would go out and rent or buy it cause you think its fun to mislead people. Youre playing with peoples time and money which you have no right to do. If the movie sucked give it a bad rating if it was good give it a good rating but dont lie.

'Well I have to admit that this movie brought some occasional laughs to my face. OK but that does not make it a good movie. Most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and truly unconvincing. Not all of them give great acting performances but some really try but fail because their characters are badly written. The perfect example is Julia Koschitz: She changes her eating habits from one talk to the other on one talk she does not drink alcohol on the next she is allergic to champagne she feels too beautiful for most people (in fact she is) but still ends up with the perfect fit concerning the looks and refuses to give some more realistic guys a chance and so on... The end is very cheesy although I like one of the final scenes when everybody finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath again. Shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughters (mostly because it is about sex and relationships I assume) and maybe some short entertainment. Still the whole picture is one big stereotype and nothing is really special about it.',neg

The trouble with this is Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing Friends had (and Im being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons.<br /><br />It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that werent that good so start with then got worse at the 100th time you saw them.

'This is an excellent film. No its not Mel Gibson in Braveheart but then its not trying to be. Actually The Emperor and the Assassin probably has (thankfully) more in common with a Shakespearean production than a Hollywood blockbuster.<br /><br />In the third century BC the King of Qin is attempting to unite (in other words conquer) the seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the Kingdom of Han. Now he needs an excuse to invade the Kingdom of Yan.<br /><br />This is where the Lady Zhao comes in. She and the King have been friends since childhood. They are obviously very much in love but cannot marry for political reasons. Together they devise a plot. She will pretend to have fallen into disfavor with the King and escape to Yan. Once there she will convince the Prince of Yan to send an assassin back to kill the King. When the assassination fails the King will have his excuse to invade Yan.<br /><br />Once in Yan however Lady Zhao begins to reconsider. Hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friends ruthlessness she begins to wonder if the King may need to be assassinated for real.<br /><br />One sure sign that youre not watching a Hollywood production is the final encounter between the King and the assassin. Unlike a Hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined this is a fight that could truly go either way.<br /><br />This is a well crafted and well acted story of a tumultuous time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. Most beautiful of all however is Gong Li as the Lady Zhao. I grow more and more convinced every time I see her that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world.<br /><br />I must say however that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film. Early on Gong Li asks one of her servants Do I have a beautiful face?<br /><br />Duh!!!',pos
'When one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white B films that were parodied on the old Mystery Science Theater 3000 television show. Yet while there were far more films like Plan 9 From Outer Space and Robot Monster than good films the 1950s did have some very good if not great science fiction films like The Day The Earth Stood Still The Incredible Shrinking Man Invasion Of The Body Snatchers War Of The Worlds and The Thing From Another World. Yet the best of the bunch for its literacy and production values was undoubtedly MGMs first big foray into A level science fiction Forbidden Planet released in 1956. It was a 98 minute color film directed by Fred M. Wilcox that featured then state of the art special effects and was endowed with a very good screenplay by Cyril Hume from a screen treatment called Fatal Planet by Irving Block and Allen Adler who adapted aspects of William Shakespeares The Tempest into it.<br /><br />The film drew raves when it was released for its Oscar nominated special effects its all electronic music score by Louis and Bebe Barron (although credited as Electronic Tonalities to avoid music guild fees) vivid matte paintings- inspired by Chesley Bonestell and the famed Monster Of The Id (MOTI) which was animated by an animator Joshua Meador on loan from the Walt Disney studio. Even more famous was the appearance of Robby The Robot in his first role in either film or television. Later he would appear in the film The Invisible Boy- included in this DVD as a bonus as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi TV shows The Twilight Zone Night Gallery and Lost In Space- with whose own robot he is often confused and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film Gremlins.<br /><br />The tale is simple but elegantly constructed and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced love story aspect in the film. In the 23rd Century the United Planets Cruiser C-57D- a flying saucer led by Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen- yes he was once a leading man type before his Police Squad days) is en route to the planet Altair IV to investigate what happened to the crew of the Bellerophon sent to the planet twenty years earlier. After a years journey there they encounter the lone survivor of the party Doctor Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) the Prospero stand-in- a philologist his gorgeous blond daughter Altaira (Anne Francis)- the Miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt and Robby the Robot the domestic servant who is the Calibanian counterpart. Morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the Bellerophon party in their first year yet he was immune to it. All in all its a technically good film- especially with some rear projections and matte paintings and the absurdity of the adult reactions to Timmys and Robbys exploits borders an Dalian surreal absurdity. Yet its manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures for its played straight thus making it even funnier. As for the main feature? Forbidden Planet deserves all its kudos. Its not a perfect film but its a great way to spend a couple of hours and far better than Star Wars which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated and juvenile. Only such films like 2001: A Space Odyssey Solaris Alien and Aliens and the first two Terminator films have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects.<br /><br />Its worth knowing that despite Forbidden Planets happy ending there is the possibility that the MOTI is still dormant within Alta as well. After all she is her fathers daughter and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the MOTI attacked the ship a second time. Also the film wisely only shows the MOTI once and never shows the Krel for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects. The film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale something that far more realistic art films often fail to do. Forbidden Planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious Cold War allegories. Watch it and you will agree as well as sleep a little less easy. But even if you dont theres still the scene of Anne Francis skinnydipping. That alone is timeless.',pos
'Yet another recent comedy that shows that Hollywood cant even do the basics when it comes to film-making that it used to do in its sleep for decades. If the writer/director had any brains they would have based the film around Stamps character of tyrant boss Jack Taylor. When hes in the film early on its nothing special but it is mildly promising and occasionally amusing. Once he departs for the majority of the film and Kutcher has his hilarious adventures house-sitting with guest after boring guest dropping in the film totally disintegrates.<br /><br />As a result what should have been a passable timewaster turns into an inept stinker.',neg
'I am surprised that so many viewers didnt find all the symbolism in the movie.....its what made the movie an incredible work of art! The story deals with some of the saddest content a movie could hold yet it is one of the best movies Ive ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the storyline.<br /><br />If you will pay close attention the message is there. The younger brother is killed by the stepfather. The older brother made up the story about the wagon flying as a way to deal with the pain of his brothers death. There are those that would argue why would he lie to his own children with the story. To me the answer is because he doesnt want to share such ugliness with his own children or that he has blocked it out and replaced his memory of the horrific event with the thought of his brother flying away to safety. Ive read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered. Although this is an interesting idea - I love the imagination used to come up with that. I dont think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother. But I do find it plausible that he would have lied about his little brothers death. However I like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at all.<br /><br />There are many different takes you can have on the movie but if you take the movie at face value.....two brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather - youve missed the brilliance. The fact that I was able to see the subtle messages in the script were what made the movie so incredible to me. It requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work......dig deep when you watch it. Youll be amazed at the genius contained in the film. The only other movie Ive seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is Pleasantville.....but thats a comment for another movie!',pos

'With a special telescope Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully proves that years ago a meteorite landed in Africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet(Bela Lugosi) form an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element. Unexpectedly Rukh discovers Radium X even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and Karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them. The sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science-fiction film during the post-World War II era. Director Hillyer used a few standing sets from FLASH GORDON series which was being filmed at the same time and also inserted some footage of electrical machines from Frankenstein. Universal kept the public unaware of the special effects being used in this great classic film. Karloff and Lugosi were at their very best and they both enjoyed working together and will be enjoyed by future generations.',pos

'Just had the misfortune to see this truly awful film.<br /><br />Think of that scene in Magnolia at the end with the slow pan in on that woman. Now remove the pan add breathing and unshaven men to the mix and you have what the entire 2 and a half hours of Humanity was<br /><br />The Inspector is a true dolt not even a dolt just a dim witted slow moving simpleton. How they ever solved a crime is beyond me.<br /><br />Obligatory sex scenes are awful and gratitious.<br /><br />Eventual villain of the piece (he raped and killed an 11 year old girl) is signposted very early and no surprise unless your are similarly dimwitted.<br /><br />Uninspiring camera work.<br /><br />The director was there saying that it is up to the audience to provide their own interpretation on the proceedings. I assume he also meant provide their own dialogue (there is bugger all - adding to its boredom level) inventive camera work (just static shots totally stripping away the obvious beauty of the landscape the film is being shot in) and plot!<br /><br />Truly awful.<br /><br />0 out of 10.',neg
'I have just watched this latest version of Macbeth and was pleasantly surprised with the solid acting and obvious effort that had to turn a low budget historical piece into a fully fledged watchable movie.<br /><br />One note however the music was very lame and added nothing to the intensity of the film and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a bunch of samplers as opposed to a full orchestral score.

'OH MY GOD.. THE WORST SH*T IVE EVER SEEN -this is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie. And I really do not understand anybody with opposite myth. Though maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable. I especially mean the role of H. Graham. What was that??? In my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers. The character was played in affected and annoying way. Every time she appears it reminds that you re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion.

'So Im at home flipping channels one night and I come across this man wearing heels and makeup standing in front of a colored background on HBO. Naturally I did a double-take and decided Id watch for a little while. I didnt change the channel until he was finished it was so incredibly hilarious. The next time it was on I made sure to tape it so I could watch it over and over again and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch. During the first couple of minutes you can tell that the audience isnt quite sure what to think but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit. While many stand-up comedians mesh together in my brain Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events. His show stayed with me afterwards. I went to Italy over the summer and all I could think about while I was there was how Italians are always on scooters going CIAO... 10 out of 10. See it. You wont regret it.',pos

Its a bit slow but the immersion was complete. The directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of Joey and his life behind bars. The music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes. The ending was unexpected with a twist I didnt see coming. Its not the kind of movie we see often.',pos

'There are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall its not very good. Limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal. The character design looks like a cross between the original Star Wars Clone Wars and Disneys Kim Possible (Brendan the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to Ron Stoppable in Kim Possible) Background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark yet by todays standards overall it is still poor and cheap looking. Many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern European or Nordic animation from the mid 80s nice in its own way but for modern child audiences used to CG slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind is sure to disappoint. The story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors arent overly impressive noticeably the usually brilliant Brendan Gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part. There are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly cliché and stereotypically racist. However some of the characters are good the Viking villains although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound. There is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by Wolves from a Viking attack that is very nicely put together. The look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film Watership Down including a blatant rip off/homage to the Ghost Rabbit of Inlay. The look is also clearly and obviously inspired by Gaelic/Celtic/Anglo Saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look. The film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner including a pretty match cut and a large scale Viking attack that is very moody and impressive. Best of all though is the music much of the background music is melodic and moving specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers. If the whole film was as poetic as this moment (and it tries) then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience but instead it isnt a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesnt stand up to modern animation standards. Overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment. Oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time not sure how that was possible.',neg

It could be set in any town in the UK. <br /><br />I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can relate to this film very well.<br /><br />Sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable.<br /><br />The actors are scarily believable I felt as if I was spying on my neighbours. It was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes.<br /><br />I loved the way this film was shot.<br /><br />Overall this film IS a must see.',pos
'Dahmer is an interesting film although I wouldnt use horror or thriller do describe it. Its more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner portrays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer who drugged murdered and dismembered his male victims. The film centers on the relationship between Dahmer and Rodney well-played by Artel Kayàru. <br /><br />Rodney is almost the more interesting character: enamored of Dahmer and having once escaped an attack he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives a second attack.<br /><br />I think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray Dahmers formative years how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into Dahmers belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims.<br /><br />The roles are well played but the story is thin.',neg

'These kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually eliminate altogether) some naive person in order to take over their life. Fatal Attraction Pacific Heights The Hand that Rocks the Cradle Single White Female and a thousand made-for-TV movies are some examples of this. But while a few especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid suspenseful characters or a few plot twists Unlawful Entry plays everything by the book. And were it not for the notoriety of its stars (Kurt Russel Ray Liota and Madeline Stowe) this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a Danielle Steele miniseries.<br /><br />Russel plays Michael Carr an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately he quietly vents his anger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop (Ray Liotta) a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for his power. At first empathizing with Carr (probably only pretending to do so) the cop befriends the couple. But soon enough the cops wants Carr out of the way so destroying the guys life nearly any way he can (which is pretty easy when youre a cop and when youre the cop who has installed the guys security system in his house) in order to take over and presumably get his wife. It seems less ends-oriented and more like the cop just wants to prove his power. The wife is more like a trophy in other words than an end. And the story plays out entirely by the book you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if youve seen enough of these movies. From the shocking moment our main naive character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the psychopathic villain) to the turn-around-hes-not-really-dead finale.',neg

'A quick paced and entertaining noir set in Vienna just after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who cant find legal work because he does not have any papers. No papers means no work permit which means no way to get a passport. He survives by driving a friends cab at night. If he gets caught it means three months in jail. One night he picks up a fare at a big hotel and drives the man to an airline office. Buka takes the mans luggage in and returns to the car. There he finds his customer has acquired an unneeded hole in the back of his head. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit they will put the grab on him real quick. No he needs time to think this out. He drives to a secluded spot empties the mans pockets and hides the body. He now has an American passport and plenty of cash! He drops by an underworld contact to have the passport photo changed. Now he just needs to go to the mans hotel and collect the mans plane ticket. His ticket to freedom! Needless to say that would be too simple. Waiting at the hotel is the dead mans mistress Joan Camden. Camden is on the run from her rather nasty husband Francis Lederer Lederer is of course the swine who had bumped off the man in Bukas cab. Camden calls the police since she believes Buka has robbed her lover. Buka shows his new passport and manages to talk his way out of the mess. Camden breaks down when hubby Lederer shows up at the police station. Lederer convinces the police Camden has suffered a mental breakdown and she is released to him. She escapes again finds Buka and the two decide to flee the country together. Lederer again puts in an appearance and Buka must decide if helping Camden is worth his freedom.

'I have to preface this by saying that I LOVE watching bad movies that are entertaining. This movie delivers 100\%. It is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. It is full of crappy stock footage of random stuff in a city (people walking traffic the skyline etc.) that doesnt tie into anything. Then there are the overly long sex scenes. These involve lots of petting and frequent rubbing of socks on each others bodies. These are in no way erotic and are the closest thing to horror you will find in this movie. This is especially true for the shower scene where two of the so called barely legal girls who couldnt be a day over 40 are spraying each other with blood but there is also a crew member squirting blood in the from the outside while one of the girls keeps smiling at him. No one had to memorize any lines for this movie if they arent clearly reading cards then they have a magazine in front of them they keep glancing at while they struggle through awkward dialogue. Then theres Mr Creepo. He throws Ed Woods name around like he can somehow compare but he is far far from anything of that quality. He walks around a cemetery babbling about random things that went wrong in the movie which really helps the complete lack of flow the movie already had going on. We couldnt stop laughing during this movie (except during the sex scenes where we were grossed out and occasionally horrified)<br /><br />I give this movie a 1/10 for going so far above and beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie.',neg
'House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels. It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller. It is blessed with marvelous performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna and a strong strong cast of supporting players and it introduces Ricky Jay card sharp extraordinaire prestidigitator and historian of magic. Its dialogue written by David Mamet is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie (in which reality is often in question) an extra dimension of unrealness.<br /><br />On the face of it House of Games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men diametrically different from The Sting which was played merely for glamour and yuks. At this level it does succeed admirably.<br /><br />However you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization. The only movie I know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated Private Benjamin. That thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of Goldie Hawn to chase after some easy laughs. House of Games sticks to its business. As Poe once said of a good short story it drives relentlessly to its conclusion.<br /><br />There is another strain of movies-about-women epitomized by Thelma and Louise a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed whether or not they realize their inner strengths. What tripe.<br /><br />As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater. It should be a natural for film festivals. Nominate it for one near you if you get the chance.<br /><br />I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter. Better she should see it on a TV than not at all.',pos
'Well i could nt get into the plot but thats just me maybe. Listless camera-movements at times nevertheless this movie has got a charming vintage quality.The acting is genuine at times and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence involving scantily clad ladies which was nice. The climax is confused and disjointed but still ...err riveting thanx to Stella Stevens.<br /><br />The stunts are interesting specially because of the 70s las vegas backdrop. There are a few jerky hand-held camera-movements at the end which keep me guessing for a while. But i dont think I ll b chasing the DVD just yet.',neg
'This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in 17th-century Brazil. The story is interesting and edifying. However this film -- as a film -- is terrible.<br /><br />The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It is Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. Battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cops dramas. Admittedly the lyrics are folk-ish tales of the slaves heroism. The special effects are absurd. Rather than invoke the mysticism of African religion and atavistic beliefs they merely make the film look cheap. They are completely unbelievable and I dont mean merely in a sense of verisimilitude.<br /><br />Life within the commune of Palmares could not have been the way it is portrayed in the film. For this society as shown in the film is one-part kibbutz one-part Afro-pop festival. Moreover it is almost embarrassing to watch the director play upon the clichés of blacks as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy. He portrays daily life as a series of dance parties in which the freed slaves paint themselves bright colors and whirl around to the strains of 80s pop music. On the other hand they have an abundance of beautiful food but the viewer hardly sees any work being done. The king inveighs against private property in a hackneyed and clichéd way. When a man complains that people are taking the vegetables that he has grown over many months the king says What comes from the earth belongs to everyone as the earth belongs to no one. If they need food they have a right to take yours.<br /><br />I am glad that I learned about this episode in history but I am relieved that a film with such low production values and that trades upon such worn stereotypes would likely not be made today.',neg
'I thought it was an excellent movie. Gary Cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who fakes his death fabulously! Over all I thought the movie was great definitely not a boring plot line! Its sad to say but I think lots of men might feel this way. I think he should have just gotten a divorce and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went to but he felt there was no other way out so he faked his death.

'In a series chock-full of brilliant episodes this one stands out as one of my very favorites. Its not the most profound episode theres no great meaning or message. But its a lot of fun and there are some fine performances.<br /><br />But what makes it really stand out for me is that it is to my knowledge the *only* Twilight Zone episode with a *double* snapper ending. The Zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story. But this time you get a surprise and think thats that but it turns out theres *another* surprise waiting. I just like that so much that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other being a deeper more message-oriented one).',pos

'Director and co-writer Alejandro Amenabar didnt make things easy for viewers of his taut a bit overlong but very disturbing story accurately based on a Spanish mans struggle to obtain assisted suicide. Mar Adentro (The Sea Inside) is gripping and its impact far exceeds the time spent in the theater.<br /><br />With the award-winning Canadian movie The Barbarian Invasions folks got to see a family along with a coterie of devoted friends address the wish of a beloved albeit irascible man to end his life. In that movie the center of attention suffered from progressive incurable cancer and his descent into a terminal stage was fast. Emotional as the scenes were death was inevitable - the question was how gentle could it be made through solicited intervention.<br /><br />Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly played by Javier Bardem) is a different story. For well over two decades hes been a quadriplegic because of a diving accident. (Very sharp viewers may detect a terrible irony as to why he ended in that condition because of his improvident dive.) Once a world traveler and lover of beautiful women he now lies trapped in an immobile body his every need attended to by a truly devoted family who willingly surrender much of their privacy and time to sustain their beloved relation.<br /><br />Rosa (Lola Duenas) a single mom of two small boys enters the Sampedro household out of what might have been mere curiosity to learn about the paralyzed mans plight but she becomes both an emotionally supportive centerpiece for Ramon as well as an amusing but occasionally aggravating presence. A nice performance by Duenas.<br /><br />The problem of course is that Sampedro isnt sick in the normal sense. He may well live for decades more with proper care. So his softly but persistently voiced desire to end his life with dignity creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who not surprisingly react from different ethical and religious perspectives.<br /><br />Ramon is the poster quad of a group dedicated to changing Spains laws concerning assisted suicide. Death with Dignity is their watchword. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who enlists the aid of pro bono publico counsel Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health issues which carry an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. Happily married to a devoted spouse she bonds emotionally with her client.<br /><br />What follows is an acutely sensitive interplay of values and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and wife their technophile teenage son not the intellectual Ramon is and his aged dad who cant stop grieving over his sons cataclysmic descent into absolute helplessness.<br /><br />The moral and legal issues are played out through excellent acting and short vignettes including a courtroom scene in which formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that might take into account Ramons feelings and views. It may be Spain but the issues are alive in most countries including the U.S.<br /><br />Especially amusing is a shouted first floor to bedroom debate between Ramon with a drop-in lecturing Jesuit priest also a quadriplegic but one whose hidebound dogma casually masks the absence of a soul.<br /><br />Special kudos to Mabel Rivera Ramons sister-in-law-Manuela for a wrenchingly authentic portrayal of a strong woman who holds the family together. And the same compliment fulsomely extends to Belen Rueda Julia who segues from objective advocate to close friend to a woman hurtling towards a dark fate.<br /><br />The director imposes no value judgments allowing each character full range to express his or her feelings effectively and at times movingly. Like Dead Man Walking this movie can support any view about its deadly subject.<br /><br />No one can stop a person from committing suicide if he/she is determined but the universal tragedy of the worlds Ramons is that without assistance life in a body in which only the heart beats and only the head can move is a sentence no court could pronounce on the most depraved of criminals.<br /><br />The cinematography is well-matched to the story and the beautiful Galician scenes are an intended contrast to the limited views the once globe-trotting Ramon experiences from his special bed.<br /><br />9/10',pos
'As I write this in November 2005 Ive become aware that the great British boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the British government not giving film makers tax breaks I think the cause is much simpler - A lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years . Lets have a look at what the Brits were producing 1995-2005:<br /><br />Funky gangster thrillers . LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape Guy Ritchies style with usually disappointing results <br /><br />Romantic comedies . Yeah okay I do realise FOUR WEDDINGS  NOTTING HILL etc were produced by American studios but theyre still vaguely  British films  . Unfortunately because theyre guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula which usually involved Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant for the umpteenth time <br /><br />Black Comedies . Can anyone explain what a black comedy actually is ? In the British context its usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resembles Mike Leighs NAKED <br /><br />Jasmin Disdars BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE is a good example of the third type of British movie . Filmed in 1999 but set in 1993 it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and its later revealed that ones a Serb and ones a Croat so we get a bite sized rundown of what was happening in the Balkans at that time  though whats the odds of two former enemies in the Balkans bumping into each other on a London bus ? This sums up one of the major flaws of the movie - Irony takes precedence over likely situations  you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the outcome likely ? Perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film . Its called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE but certainly this audience member found them clichéd stereotypical people that I couldnt believe in as three dimensional characters',neg
'Christopher Guest is the master of the mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of many documentary greats out there. Zak Penn isnt good at either but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two. Guest often plays around with reality and fiction but the line between the two is always clear in his films sort of an essential with a mockumentary. Penn could also take a lesson from the The Blair Witch Project. Even though you knew it was a fake documentary going in you totally bought into the world the filmmakers created. It seems to the audience as if the whole thing is real even though you know deep down youre watching fiction. In other words it was fiction successfully disguised as truth. In fact many early audiences watching it at Sundance and other premiere audiences thought it was real. Penn whose forte by his own admission is screen writing should probably stick to that. Documentary or mockumentary film-making (and its hard to tell where one begins and the other ends with this film) is obviously not. <br /><br />Penn sets the stage for what he tries to sell as a legit documentary on the filming of a documentary sort of a meta-documentary. Penn however confuses the audience and loses their trust from the get-go as he enters Herzogs house before the filming of Herzogs film Enigma of Loch Ness about the myth of the Loch Ness monster (a film which apparently was never finished  probably because of Penns interference). Even though Penn is apparently the director of the film were watching he starts it by looking at the cameras and saying What is the film crew doing here? and starts shying away from them. He does this on a couple other occasions as well. He will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming thus forcing the camera guy to hide in the shadows to pick up snippets of dialogue between Herzog and Penn. It seems to be a gimmick but that is never made clear and Penn is apparently keeping us in the dark intentionally. This leaves the audience scratching its head wondering Who is in charge here? If Penn is working against his own film crew what kind of a world are we a part of? This is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction. <br /><br />Penn seems to only fully enter the fictional world (I think) when the crew has sightings of what appears to be the Loch Ness monster. But by the time the monster makes its first appearance we have totally exited the fictional world Penn has attempted to create so it all just seems silly and pointless. <br /><br />This is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity in that Penn has a chance to document a master at work but completely loses focus and it becomes a movie about Penn and his antics instead of the filming of a documentary. Penns presence begins to pervade and overshadow everything else in the movie. <br /><br />The Herzog interviews are convincing and we actually believe he isnt acting. We even start to wonder if he and others on his crew are being duped by Penn much the way the audience is but youre never sure of even that. Penn in his interviews to the camera attempts to be quirky and unintentionally funny like the characters interviewed in a Guest mockumentary but he only succeeds in being annoying. In a Guest film this effect is hilarious while here it falls flat because youre never sure what Penn is about. As a result we the audience start to dislike him as much as the crew apparently does. Aside from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous appearance out of nowhere of a beautiful model thrown in to give the movie spice there is little to recommend here. Perhaps its only redeeming quality (an unintentional one at that) is that its a great example of why the audience is important; and by completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling your doing them a disservice. For that reason alone I think this would be a good film to show to film students  sort of a what not to do kind of movie. I have nothing against a movie told in an unconventional way as long its done skillfully with a thematic base to give it substance. This film is completely lacking in that.<br /><br />Id like to call it a valiant effort at something but Im not sure what it is other than a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time. <br /><br />(As a side note: It seems like bad art always calls to mind good. This film made me think of the book Picture by Lillian Ross. Ross followed John Huston around during the filming of The Red Badge of Courage and brilliantly documented it for the New Yorker. It would make a great movie in fact. If you want a great example of meta-art read it.)',neg
'I always feel strange and guilty saying it (because Im a fairly well-educated non-teenager) but I actually sort of like the Olsen twins and I respect the movies they make even though Ive never really been their target audience. When in Rome was a traditional Mary-Kate and Ashley movie complete with the foreign travel accents motorbikes adult romance as a B storyline fashion orientation and even the gag reel over the credits. I enjoyed myself. When in Rome and the other Olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything theyre not; most of the time they only premiere on video and they never claim to be the next Citizen Kane or even An Affair to Remember. My point is people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another Olsen twin movie will be disappointed.<br /><br />That said those who ARE fans of the Olsen twins will really enjoy themselves. For those of us whove watched them since the first episodes of Full House its really great to see them growing into more mature roles. This movie provides important historical and geographical information just like many of their other movies (remember 10 Downing Street from Winning London and the visit to the Louvre from Passport to Paris?) as well as providing good clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family.<br /><br />As long as I still feel like Im on my soapbox and as long as I can make it relevant to the movie let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the Olsen twins: in order to be a fan of the Olsen twins you dont have to be some pre-teen valley girl from California. In fact thats not really the target audience. If it were the MK&A fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through Gap or some store like that not Wal-Mart. When in Rome while it does feature high fashion and globe-trotting and two girls from a valley in Cali isnt really ABOUT that... its more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places. If that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes so be it. Thats called marketing--you take an idea and sell it by making it appealing. At least theyre sending a good message even if the means seem a little superficial. <br /><br />Basically dont knock the film until youve seen it and then dont knock it until youve tried to understand what the Olsen twins do: they encourage young girls to be creative intuitive and driven young women. This movie does that I think just like their others. Kids - enjoy. Parents - do the same. If you like the Olsen twins you wont be disappointed.',pos

'Cosimo (Luis Guzman) ends up in prison for car burglary and there hes given the plan for the perfect heist from a lifer in prison; so he has to get out of jail fast. He tells his girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson) to find a man who will do his time in prison for some money. But no one wants to do the time for Cosimos crime and yet everybody seems to know a guy who will do that. Soon bad boxer Pero Mahalovic (Sam Rockwell) founds out the details of this so called perfect job.<br /><br />First of all I think this movie was very funny and from my point of view I would recommend it to everyone. This movie is remake of Italian comedy I Soliti Ignoti. I didnt watch the Italian original so I cannot judge or compare those two movies. But Welcome to Collinwood is great comedy for itself about four people trying to rob the money from the vault in one house. Everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast. Really excellent movie for these actors: Sam Rockwell William H. Macy (great) Isaiah Washington Michael Jeter (great) Luis Guzmán Patricia Clarkson Jennifer Esposito and finally George Clooney gave their share in this project. <br /><br />Maybe to say that this movie is only comedy isnt fair. This is more then that. Because of one difference. All of thieves in this movie have very small wishes when they are asked: what will they do with their money? It is mostly securing their future in very humble way. This fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals. And not only them but also cop Babitch who is presented like corrupted one; so here directors Russo presents us fact that criminals and cop are the same. Actually all in Collinwood are; and not only in Collinwood cause all people chase money on legal or illegal way. I dont like all movies were audience eventually likes and cheers for thieves. But this one is exception. You have to love them all. Riley with his little baby and wife in jail. Toto with his pants. Cosimo with his line: Your mothers a whore! and all others. They are just like characters in my favorite comic Alan Ford. They all trying to make some money but simply they are out of luck. But they all did one good deed: they gave money to Riley so he can get his wife out of prison. They are all heroes in my eyes cause lots of honest people wouldnt do that.',pos
'***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />This movie The Divers is really interesting. All I roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking Danish. But I decided to check it out for one reason the fact that the story evolves around a sunken WWII German submarine. Ive got a fetish for German subs especially wrecks that can be dived upon. So I was a bit sceptical about the Danish part but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part. Knowing that Nordic films arent always that good and not sure of the budget size I was to say the least very sceptical.<br /><br />Upon viewing I was ... surprised.<br /><br />I had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate seeing how some are very young the two main actors in particular. This was not an issue they both perform very well. As do the other actors who mostly consist of people in their 50s and beyond. This makes for some interesting interaction between young and old not often seen on the screen. Not unique in anyway but somewhat rare. And its all good.<br /><br />As for the Danish language it is nearly impossible to understand. But this was no problem it had subtitles.<br /><br />Another issue was the submarine itself I suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine. Having decided their budget was slim I thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at its worst. Again I was surprised the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. Having a fetish for German subs I knew what the sub should look like especially inside and was not let down. The team has done some serious research. Its all good.<br /><br />I suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so I feel I must issue a warning. The submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war. Its a special purpose sub. But to give you a hint of what to expect its a crossing between a Type VII Type IX and a Japanese transport sub similar to I-52. Its god a good design and makes a nice wreck.<br /><br />The setting is on a Danish island or peninsula I cant remember. Its summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year. Their grandfather is a mariner of sorts. The cinematography is quite nice a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks some newfound teenage love nice diving weather and a general feeling of perfect. Once again its all good.<br /><br />Plot-wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind a gathering of men hire one of the boats an old minesweeper and its crew. One of the visitors a man in his 50s has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back. The islands senior citizens all remember when a german u-boat was sunk towards the end of world war II and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths. The grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u-boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945. No submarine was ever found.<br /><br />WHAT TO EXPECT<br /><br />Key elements are nazi experiments nazi history treasure hunting secrecy competition teen love conspiracy and ...a surprise.<br /><br />*** WARNING - SPOILER ***<br /><br />I had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard. Not being a big fan of supernatural events it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem. Its not like From dusk til dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end. This is a bit more subtle.<br /><br />OVERALL : Really good movie I gave it an 8. Some due to the fact that it isnt a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. I later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned Danish veterans. But even if this had been a Hollywood production I would give it a 7 or 8. Definately worth your while. Yes a childs story in a way but then again a mature tale. It has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure which I found very appealing. And again the cinematography is really nice.<br /><br />/Medusa 2001<br /><br />',pos
'Boston legal has turned its tail and is headed for the barn door and th pig slop it has created! When this show first aired almost four season back it was a humorous slap at the legal system which all actors seem to take pride in portraying. It was funny diversified and to some extent factual. The characters portrayed were acceptable and to an extent real in their portrayals. The sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series she participated but is now dragged to the lower depths of Media programming of sex and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this production. Rene Adjurdubois Is an excellent actor who has from the days of Benson to this production held his own in the field of entertainment always showing the humor and respectful acting of the production. Captain Kirk is. Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and is to be admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress. James Spader there is no doubt in his acting ability however he should go back to his XXX origins such as Crash as it appears he has much talent and inclination in that direction.

I was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman! The characters did not represent any women that I know they were boring bitter and melodramatic.

'Alone in the Dark is Uwe Bolls kick in the nuts to Hollywood after House of the Deads punch in the face.<br /><br />If anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator Boll is. After forcing Artisan out of business over the flop that was House of the Dead one can only assume the normally credible Lions Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisans assets. Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film-making ability plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movies framework.<br /><br />But then thats the point isnt it. Boll isnt trying to make a coherent film because he isnt trying to direct Alone in the Dark. Hes just trying to manipulate Hollywood.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark like House of the Dead Dungeon Siege Far Cry Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are announced or in pre-production.<br /><br />These arent movies to be directed but investment portfolios. Every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects he can release within that time-frame the more money he and his investors can gain. Why bother making a good movie when a bad movies making you a mint anyway? The result is movies like the awfulness of Alone in the Dark.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywoods current trend for lazy film-making.<br /><br />And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood congratulations by making a cult figure out of the man youre just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety.<br /><br />For more information read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=21699 As an aside just dont ask me how hes getting his cast-lists together.

'The Assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character rather than star turns the need to stage special effects obligatory romance and endless car chases. However there is a car chase in here and a dandy it is. Aidan Quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer recruited to eliminate him. It is rare that a second or third tier actor such as Quinn is given an important starring role like this that carries a film. Usually such a role is given to an A-list actor with box office draw which is probably why I never heard of this film before I saw it. Donald Sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous somewhat creepy at times agent that recruits Quinn. Ben Kingsley is fine also as the Israeli agent. The plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines which converge in gradual fashion toward the end and not all at once as were used to seeing. The paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. The locations are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is nothing special but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days without dumb and/or meaningless plot developments; unconvincing star turns; loud annoying music video type soundtracks; a villain that hams it up; and repeatedly a cast costumes and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25. This is an outstanding thriller which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release. ***1/2 of 4 stars.',pos

'or any stories reminiscent of the Leopold and Loeb case you may find this movie entertaining. The cast includes Robert Culpwith Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as the college students.<br /><br />Peter Falk is his usual self pretending to be tricked by the precocious students. Caffrey (Longtime Companion Buried Alive) is excellent and should do more of these menacing roles. Basically the two frat buddies become tired of their demanding parents who expect nothing less than academic perfection attendance at the best schools will only be financed if they conform. There is an excellent scene wherein Culp rakes Caffrey over the coals after he gets a low grade threatens to cut off his trust funds and Caffrey later says to his friend: I hate him I want him dead...<br /><br />All is not well in Beverly Hills.

'One of the worst movie I have seen in 2009 so far: The story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy.<br /><br />As nothings happens the void is filled with long boring dialogs that dont make any sense! <br /><br />The cast is famous but doesnt bring any emotions except to fast-forward the play! <br /><br />And it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. In comparison the one of the Shining is funfair! <br /><br />NB: a lot of users think that it is located in the French Riviera! They are wrong! It isnt the south of France (Nice Cannes) but totally the opposite: Cabourg & Normandy to be simple the beaches of the D-Day! Thats why the sea is as grey as the sky and there isnt sun!',neg
'This is the first American film I have seen at this year and I think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling . As a teenage singer in AmericaAaron is not as pop as beforemost Americans I met said his song is fake and that he even didnt know how to rap.But attentioneveryonehe is a kidhow many people can understand him.Being a pop fan is difficultand being a pop star is more difficult.I think this time Aaron(JD) has shows something real to us.And I think people should learn to understand each other. At another handI like the music in the film very much.I remember the first song appeared in the film is Saturday Night and it also include some Aarons real live showAnd the second one is One Betterso I think if you enjoy this filmmaybe youll be a pop fantoo. At lastI hope you will have a great time^^ A voice from a Chinese boy.',pos
'I watched this film for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. Thats a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously though this film is living proof that formula works. If it aint broke it dont need fixin. A streetwise-yet-vulnerable heroine a hardened ex-cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with issues. Pure magic.',neg
'This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing pratt falls 75\% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards poor editing horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise) and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didnt think Id ever say this but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasnt dead inside. Even Bogdanovichs kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. Theres a reason Bogdanovich couldnt get another project until 4 years later. Please dont watch it. If you see it in your television listings cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it youre better off finding another soulmate. Id rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum this film up in one word that word would be: Suckotrocity',neg
'Woeful and unnecessary sequel to a bonafide classic. An American Werewolf in London was indisputably a gem of a movie: humorous demented with just a dash of romance and so very very British it made me want to stand up and sing God Save the Queen every time the movie ended. Then came this abomination. You know you are in real trouble when the leads are so utterly unlikeable you are glad when they are slaughtered and actually start cheering for the lycanthropes. Tell you the truth folks I only got about half way through this CGIed travesty before losing the will to live and turning it off. Absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyones time.',neg
'I had a feeling that after Submerged this one wouldnt be any better... I was right. He must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product... his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish. Its nothing more than a B or C-grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an OK sound designer.<br /><br />Like the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post-production (...voice dubbing etc.) Too bad cause the plots actually OK for a SG flick.<br /><br />Ill never rent another SG flick unless he emails me asking for forgiveness.<br /><br />Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock...<br /><br />--jimbo',neg
'Each guy Liv Tyler meets loses their head over her not of course without some small encouragement from Liv. Liv is at her beautiful best with Matt Dillon tops among the paramours. Interesting initial premise to tell story from perspective of each dupe degenerates into sitcom-style finale (not unlike Blame It On Rio with which it has more than a few similarities). Worth watching nonetheless.',pos
'I have not read the other comments on the film but judging from the average rating I can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary.<br /><br />I watched it for the second time with my children. They absolutely loved it. True it did not have the adults rolling around the floor but the sound of the childrens enjoyment made it seem so.<br /><br />It is a true Mel Brooks farce with plenty of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money not for whom we are and how fickle are our friends and associates. There are many other films on a similar subject matter no doubt many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults. Its hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family however.<br /><br />Hence for the children a 9/10 from me.',pos
'this is one of the funnier films ive seen. it had its crude moments but they were full of charm. its Altmanesque screenplay brilliant physical humour and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for Steve Carells nipple..i truly was. surprisingly this is a good-natured unabashed comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way. Catherine Keener was terrific as Trish and all of Steve Carells friends were flawed but amiable and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original charming and very funny. highly recommended.',pos
'Visually speaking this film is stunning. It has some delightful black comedic moments. But on the whole the plot is very clichéd as is its seeming message. If youre a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw youll love it. If youre looking for something at all high-brow steer away. I saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06 and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing. Ultimately it isnt disturbing. Just grinding and unpleasant to sit through. If you genuinely want to be challenged go see something like The Lost. If you want to be grossed out or tell your friends about a really messed up film then this is for you.',neg
'The film isnt perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isnt really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes dont work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again so what? Its got lovable characters its well shot the acting is mostly good it never becomes too maudlin or dramatic its quirky. Look at how many people love I Dream of Jeannie. Is it perfect? Heck no! And while this is very different I say check it out and youll be in a good mood after you see it.',pos
'This film was different. It took a sort of typical thriller story and reached for a more interesting in-depth look at an individual characters struggle with faith. Of course it helped that the main performance by Andrew McCarthy was quite excellent. The other performances were also quite interesting although not as consistent. The ending was a bit of a let down but there were lots of good moments. The film-makers tried something different here -- they didnt just go for the obvious chills and scares. This is a dark film (not for everyone) but if you want to be entertained and not talked down to try this one.',pos
'I want to add to the praise for the production of this film especially the luminous cinematography. Firelight glistening off of smooth and muscled skin creates stunningly beautiful imagery. The film was nominated for (and won) a single Oscar - the first given for editing. Malas performance is moody penetrating and powerful.',pos
'Im assuming the filmmakers heart was in the right place but frankly this movie is truly unconscionable. I was offended by the tone and the total cop out ending. You cannot take issues like this so lightly! Without knowing the final caveat of the movie... we watch as a guy guns down his 9 month pregnant wife and two sons and are supposed to follow him for the next 2+ hours as he tries to establish a new life?? You cannot have sympathy for a character who does this. Cannot! Not to mention were given nothing until the last say 1/2 hour of this unnecessarily long movie as to why this guy is suffering so much. No flashbacks no sudden reactions to noise or movement - stuff that real vets are suffering from. All we know is he has a pain in the ass wife and cant financially take care of her and his 3 kids. There really didnt seem to be any research whatsoever into what current Iraq vets are going through.<br /><br />Additionally the movie suffers tremendously from a heavy handed and totally inappropriate score. Its a catastrophe. It is truly harmful to some actually good acting on the part of the male lead and at times Joe Morton. It foreshadows EVERYTHING youre supposed to feel and sometimes gives you the wrong clues entirely! Again this was a brutal thing this guy did and so seeing him get a new job meet a new blonde struggle behind the counter making toast is NOT appropriate! And really the ending? What a freakin cop out! How dare you.<br /><br />There are far richer films dealing with the affects of war on returning soldiers please dont bother with this one.',neg
'I wont be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season but then things got worse. The concept is nothing special just about a girl named Casey who is trying to cope with a new step-brother Derek and his loud crude family while she gradually forces her princess standards onto each of them.<br /><br />In season 1 the story was actually interesting. I liked Casey back then because she was smart strong independent and conservative. She was well-mannered and deep. I felt bad when she was being harassed at her new school by her new step-brother. She was a perfectionist but not as annoying as the later episodes. Oh and she dated a nice guy who is now currently portrayed as one of Dereks idiot friends. The season grasped the true tension the title of the show was trying to capture.<br /><br />Now I cant say the show has really gone downhill because the story is sometimes interesting but I root for Derek now instead of Casey. Now there is little if any interaction between the two siblings. If they interact its only briefly. Oh and I dont want any Dasey fans in my face. People thats called INCEST even if they are step-siblings. My tolerance can only go so far but thats not the point.<br /><br />Its strange. Derek as the antagonist has gotten more sensitive over time while Casey the supposed protagonist is more neurotic and unlikeable than before. I like how the younger kids get more airtime but the parents are even more clueless than before. But thats not the biggest problem...<br /><br />Unfortunately we are forced to see everything from Caseys point of view with lame nauseating background music. She has gotten stupider and more shallow over time. In one episode she got whiny and wanted her boyfriend to be more chivalrous so she purposely dumped food on herself and blamed Derek. Now what happened to being a strong independent feminist? I havent watched much of the fourth season but I hear she is dating a guy named Truman who is a jackass and is arrogant. Oh I remember that fencing episode. She constantly reminds him she doesnt like him freaks out over being goosed by a sword and in the end hooks up with him because she can handle him? What the hell? Why go with a guy like that in the first place. The 1st season Casey would have just punched him in his...never mind. Or maybe that would have been my reaction. Oh and shes a cheerleader. Not that thats a bad thing but I think she fell on her head at one of her practices. And in a prom episode she cried because she couldnt find the dress in her dreams and wasnt completely satisfied until she became prom queen. One thing Ive noticed is that no matter how bad Casey tries to tell us her life is things almost always go her way in the end (she gets the guy she wants Derek gets some kind of revenge people all love her etc.) Derek is still quite immature but I see that he really has matured. I dont see why many people hate Sally. She seems nice and its good to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about rather than playing the field. He is also treating Edwin slightly better and is a good brother to Marti.<br /><br />Really the show is so-so and I rated it low because despite some character development the character I once admired has now become like any fashionable teen queen you can see anywhere on TV. But it was good while it lasted.',neg
'Barbra Streisands debut television special is still a pinnacle moment in entertainment history - in any media. Cleverly divided into three separate acts (to minimize the interruption of commercial breaks) Streisand made the bold-yet-masterful decision to drop the typical variety show format of the time (which is why there is no guest stars nor forced banter) and carry the entire show on her shoulders alone. The risky move paid off enormously as MY NAME IS BARBRA set a new standard for musical programming on television.<br /><br />Filmed in glorious black-and-white (which actually adds to the effectiveness of the show) MY NAME IS BARBRA is flawlessly-conceived and impressively shot. However what makes the show truly transcendent is Streisand herself. Watching the then-23 year old performer navigate herself through the shows 55 minute runtime is nothing less than thrilling. She is in fantastic voice (and even performs the entire first and third acts live) and gives first evidence of the immense star power that would soon follow her to the big screen.<br /><br />The specials biggest asset is its boldness in allowing Streisand to simply stand on stage and sing some great songs. After the powerful opening performance of Much More (with a brief opening snippet from Leonard Bernsteins My Name Is Barbara) Barbra proceeds to wander through a multi-level studio set performing a frantic version of the Disney classic Im Late. In between verses of Im Late Streisand stops at various levels of the set to sing some terrific numbers such as the haunting Make Believe and the thundering How Does the Wine Taste? Halfway through the Act I Barbra re-enters her own childhood to the strains of A Kid Again and then gives highly energetic performances of Im Five and Sweet Zoo while romping among an over-sized set. The illusion is eventually shattered however as Streisand finds herself out of the fantasy and back in the real world. She then sings about this lost childhood innocence in the lovely Where Is the Wonder? Streisand then dashes out onto a platform stage surrounded by an entire room-full of musicians and performs a rousing rendition of People before the thunderous applause of a live studio audience.<br /><br />Act II of the special begins with Streisand hamming it up for the studio audience with a campy rendition of Ive Got the Blues before delivering a comedy monologue about Pearl from Istanbul. Streisand then heads off to Bergdorf Goodmans department store which allows her to sing a medley of poverty songs while parading around in some of the stores elegant fashions. This segment is the brightest highlight of the special for many fans and critics. Some high points of the Act II medley include Streisand singing a restrained version of Second Hand Rose to the audience appearing as a Latin bullfighter to the tune of Nobody Knows You When Youre Down and Out and portraying a frustrated paperboy while mugging to Brother Can You Spare a Dime. The third Act of the special is a straight concert with no set pieces or concepts. Streisand is a performer who really thrives on the concert stage and this segment is the most thrilling moment of the special. Streisand enters belting out an almost gravity-defying rendition of When the Sun Comes Out and continues to amaze the viewer with a lovely version of THE YEARLING ballad Why Did I Choose You a scorching performance of Lover Come Back to Me and an impassioned medley of three songs form FUNNY GIRL. Streisand really outdoes herself however with a phenomenal rendition of the Fanny Brice/Billie Holiday standard My Man which instantly became on of the singers best-loved signature songs.<br /><br />Streisand performs her immortal ballad version of Happy Days Are Here Again as the closing credits roll by on the left-hand side of the screen. The iconic finish to the number reaffirms to the viewer that he or she has indeed seen something truly special. MY NAME IS BARBRA was a huge rating triumph when first aired and it eventually picked up five Emmy awards in addition to spawning two Top-Five Gold-selling soundtrack albums. Watching it all again its absolutely no surprise.',pos
'I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasnt terribly motivating and didnt even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one. In fact there was almost zero technical information at all. I didnt expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video but when that info was near zero then the film just wasnt balanced and wasnt particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run.<br /><br />There were other problems. Some of the very first images were people collapsing near death while trying to run a race. Yeah real inspiring. The timing was also hard to follow because it was semi chronological but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at. And they withheld information. You see that Kantor has an injury and you just assume its from all her training but then several scenes later they finally clue you in that its because she tripped over a pine cone in her yard.<br /><br />Some parts were very good though like the bit about a woman defying race officials who wanted the run to be men-only and the coverage of a Chicago race where two of the runners portrayed earlier were vying for first place.<br /><br />Off the top of my head Im thinking of other chronological documentaries like Supersize Me and Grass where you always know where you are and you feel like they told you everything you wanted to know.<br /><br />In short it wouldnt have been hard to make a better marathon film and as it stands I cant recommend this to non-marathoners to educate and motivate them to try one because I dont think it will have that effect.',neg
'Ladies and Gentlemenplease dont get fooled by A Stanley Kubrick film tag.This is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made.Horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film.In Shiningthere is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naivefoolish attempt made to create chilling horror.Everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality.All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too.A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lostlazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.There is not much to be said of a baldcolored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor.No need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.It cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.',neg
'MABEL AT THE WHEEL is one of those movies with a behind-the-scenes story thats more interesting than the movie itself. This was Chaplins tenth comedy for Keystone during his year of apprenticeship and his first two-reeler. Here he played one of his last out-and-out villain roles (although the feature-length TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE was yet to come) and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself. In fact Chaplins conflicts with director and co-star Mabel Normand almost got him fired from the studio.<br /><br />Chaplin hadnt gotten along with his earlier directors Henry Lehrman and George Nichols but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere girl was the last straw. Charlie and Mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film. Chaplin was still a newcomer at Keystone and his colleagues didnt know what to make of him but everyone loved Mabel. Producer Mack Sennett was on the verge of firing Chaplin when he learned that the newcomers films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them A.S.A.P. so Chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way Mabel wanted it.<br /><br />Unfortunately none of that drama is visible on screen in MABEL AT THE WHEEL which looks like typical Keystone chaos. The story concerns an auto race in which Mabels beau (Harry McCoy) is scheduled to compete but wicked Charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad and Mabel must take the wheel in his place. For all the racing around brick hurling and finger-biting the film is frankly short on laughs but there are a few points of interest. Theres some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence though there arent really any gags just lots of frantic activity. Chaplin himself looks odd sporting a goat-like beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance MAKING A LIVING but the outfit suits the old-fashioned villainy he displays throughout. At least its novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role. Visible in the stands at the race track are such Keystone stalwarts as Chester Conklin Edgar Kennedy in a strangely dandified get-up and a more characteristic Mack Sennett spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine. As a performer Sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced but you have to give the guy credit: he knew what people liked. These films were hugely popular in their day. Macks performance doesnt add much to MABEL AT THE WHEEL but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didnt kill each other.',neg
'Nell Shipman must have been paid a hefty sum of money to promote the Maxwell automobiles off-road capabilities. The plot of the movie is pretty simple Nell plays a writer who has a bad case of writers block and needs inspiration so she goes to visit Mexico to absorb the atmosphere. There she meets the hero (Bert Van Tuyle) a cowboy who chooses to drive a car rather than ride a horse. While Nell is visiting with her fathers partner at his mining camp a gang of local bandits kidnap her and bring her to their camp deep in the wilderness. The hero needs to get to her quickly so he decides to drive there in his car. This is where the film takes a weird twist. Bert proceeds to drive over every terrain imaginable huge rocks small streams heavy brush scraggly tree stumps steep inclines etc etc for the greater part of the film we get to see this car struggling to crawl over obstacles. Now mind you this isnt a modern-day ATV its a 1920 Maxwell automobile so it looks very out-of-place as an off-road vehicle. And it clearly has limitations for some of the terrain it encounters we get to see it stuck more than once in this film. But the filmmakers made an effort to show it beating the odds and eventually passing all the obstacles. Once the hero gets to the hidden camp and rescues the girl he jumps in the car with her and drives off with the bandits in hot pursuit (on horseback) and at this point it became hysterically funny to me. Watching this car slowly rolling over huge rocks getting stuck in gravel and mountain brush going forward and back to get momentum enough to pass over fallen tree limbs the bandits should have had ample time to catch up. But they never do even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout the night. And in a silly climax the car climbs a mountainside and helps Nell and the hero push a huge boulder down the side to crush the pursuing bandits.<br /><br />After seeing this film you would think the army should invest in 1920 Maxwell automobiles because they clearly have better off-road capabilities than Hummers and Bradley tanks combined. Watch this film just for laughs its worth it just to see Nell cuddling up to the car grill and saying You did your best brave little car',neg
'This is one great sweeping movie you will remember for a long time. It is about history America the change of times Teddy Roosevelt Morocco a kidnapped American and her children and the leader of the Berbers with the blood of the Prophet in his veins.<br /><br />This movie is based on a true story--like Jesse James was a banker. An American WAS kidnapped in Morocco and the Marines went part-way to the shores of Tripoli to rescue him. So much for that. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is the Berber chieftain and Muslim leader. Candice Bergan is the guy who was kidnapped along with her two kids; the son is Rex Harrisons grandson Simon no less. John Huston is Secretary of State with a great John-Huston-style straight line at a State Dinner watch out for it. Brian Kieth IS Teddy Roosevelt all-American all-male a character that is an interesting commentary as modern as today.<br /><br />The sweep and beauty of the desert and Morocco are shown beautifully in the cinematography in this film which will stay with you a haunting and compelling memory. The score is as sweeping and exotic as the images.<br /><br />This is a story about two cultures both with grand ideas and historic pasts struggling for the future without an idea at all about one another. In any event the struggle comes down to might versus ingenuity.<br /><br />Then at the last there is the little boy--remember the little boy? What do you think HE thinks?',pos
'This movie is more like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies he feels like making music and when he is making music he feels like making movies. The best thing in Promise me this is the music written by Stribor Kusturica.<br /><br />Kusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise. Promise me this has very little noise.<br /><br />I liked Life is a miracle. It was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful plot. Promise me this has no plot. I was awaiting this movie with big expectations because Ive read that the script has been written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favourite scriptwriters who participated also in Life is a miracle. Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues but for Kusturica they are noise and much to my regret I saw only two dialogues which I could identify as written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor.<br /><br />Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the scripts for Time of the gypsies and Black cat white cat) said in an interview that Kusturica never follows the script. Black cat white cat was the only script for which Kusturica said that he will not touch it. According to Gordan Mihic after all Kusturica comes back to the script and if he doesnt he doesnt make a good movie. And I think this is the case with Promise me this. He should have followed the script of Ranko Bozic.<br /><br />Promise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few moments which made me laugh. The comedic moments are in the same style as Black cat white cat but are not that funny at all. I think the difference comes from the fact that Black cat white cat was written by Gordan Mihic.<br /><br />However I know some people who liked Promise me this they find it very positive movie.',neg
'Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of worn out VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name written on top. I think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties was because of Sandra Bullocks name. Bullocks fans dont have to disappoint. Sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting. Rest of the movie Its fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because its bad but after that its going worse. Much worse. Directing is awful. Acting is awful. Script is awful. Dialog is awful. Action is awful. Music is quite good actually. Typical score for eighties action movies. This movie is so bad that it goes close to anything Andy Sidaris has ever produced. Its so bad that there isnt proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie. But still there was Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /><br />I think they can now bring the film out on DVD. It could be cool!

'I tend to like character-driven films. I also think Hope Davis turns in consistently good work so I had high hopes for this movie. Those hopes were soon dashed.<br /><br />The main flaw with this movie is the direction. There are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences. The movie makes frequent use of the Denis Leary character as the alter ego of the Campbell Scott character. It doesnt work for me at all. This would have worked better as a play than a movie.<br /><br />There are problems with the plot as well. It is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started. I didnt feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Finally the editing wasnt well done either. There was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring.<br /><br />Except for acting which I felt was consistently strong this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema.',neg
'Watched both parts twice. Enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very believable as the hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I do admit that I would have preferred seeing someone else as the Lady in Distress. Alison Doody should stick with modern and not period pieces. She didnt have the look of the woman of the 1800s. The rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well. I am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older. Age is inevitable but lets not hide from it. A man at 50+ can be much sexier (and  Patrick truly is sexy) then a green youth no matter how pretty. Hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile.',pos
'Cooley High is such a great film that even with the periods sound track urban landscape wardrobe and slang...it still doesnt feel dated. The sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itself.<br /><br />Instead it absorbs you right into it. That is a staple of a good movie. From start to finish it doesnt miss a beat and I never grow tired of watching it.<br /><br />Its ending is unique in the respect that its one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings. There may have been a few since (Backdraft comes to mind) but Cooley was the first and much more emotional.',pos
'Being a fan of the game and watching this film made me physically vomit!!<br /><br />It was an awful film though the story was similar to the games plot. the whole super human soldiers thing. Other than that Jack Carver an all American man in the game is played by a germen unless thats some sort of twisted irony that is what made me pull a middle finger at my TV screen the second it started. The fact that you can tell its filmed in a forest in the middle in what seemed like the middle of summer this is uncalled for because the game is set in the tropical rain forest whereas this looks like the director just looked out his window in the morning and went thats a good forest.<br /><br />THIS IS A NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: If you ever plan to make a film based on a game/book play it understand it and ask fans about it... dont just play it for an hour and assume you know it!!!',neg
'Well<br /><br />First of all as many reviewers have pointed out - this is a rip off of the Martin Cahill story - first represented by the BBC and by the John Boorman film The General - which is a great film and far far superior to this one.<br /><br />Speaking as a native British person the supporting cast to Kevin Spacey was really good in terms of British and Irish acting talent especially Peter Mullan - but it was totally wasted. The characters were c**p! And as for Kevin Spacey - didnt come across as a loveable rogue but as nothing really substantial or significant.<br /><br />Not a lot to redeem this film. The best bits are the gags and tricks nicked from the other films it rips off. Compare notes on this film and The General - Id be interested to see what others think.<br /><br />',neg

'Thirty years prior to THE DEER HUNTER came this movie an excellent meditation on the effects of war inflicted on the American family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives. A truly ironic title THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is anything but since those times have vanished into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved.<br /><br />Truly an ensemble cast despite the top-billing of Myrna Loy THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES focuses more on the stories of the men. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) comes back to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his doting wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry upon returning cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to Marie a happy-go-lucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him. Homer Parrish on the other hand has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world -- including the girl he loves and her family -- thinks he is a freak of nature.<br /><br />At almost three hours of length the film never seems long and drawn out. There is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot breezes by; nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing. Not a performance rings false though the standouts are those of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Even then every character has his or her moment on film and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in American films (including the ones made around World War One which did not dabble in such topics). While there is never any overt violence its all there in the haunted expressions of the three male leads faces in the lot where the planes now reside ready to be turned into junk (and therefore forgetfulness) in the cynicism of the store owners who couldnt be bothered to employ these shell-shocked men who had seen battle or even worse to goad them into wondering what was it all worth for. This is the film in which COMING HOME and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY are indebted to. At a time when America fled from war films to come up with this when the end of the Second World War was still fresh was a necessity in order to make a more honest film-making.',pos
'if you are like me then you will love this great coming of age teen movie.i think it is up there with mischief/book of love/high school USA/shout/calender girl/crybaby/ all great movies set in the lat 50s & early 60s and it has a wonderful soundtrack.not as many songs as in some of these type of movies but still great.it is all so very funny at times and has a great love interest.all the young cast are great.i wish there were more type of these wonderful movies.my favourite movie of all time is back to the future when Marty mcfly gos back to 1955 well in these wonderful movies it stays in the fab 50s(early 60s) there are some movies of this type better than this but not many.',pos
'When anyone comes into a film of this type of film its not without saying that an overdose of that great over-the-counter brain-medicine Suspension of Disbelief comes in mighty handy.<br /><br />Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna/Brigitta the woman who Nelson Eddy has ignored since the beginning of time but who also is -- an angel sent to Earth.<br /><br />My reaction when I saw this was a mute gasp of Hunh? Where have I seen this before? It turns out I have seen it before but in a movie made much later than this one. DATE WITH AN ANGEL a forgettable pile of dreck made in 1987 cashed in on the ethereal beauty of one Emmanuelle Beart who had no speaking lines also wore a blond wig and made life hell for soap-actor Michael Knight. Much worse in every conceivable angle with ultra-low 80s values but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey.<br /><br />Anyway not to elaborate this is not a memorable film and stands as a doorstop of information because it was the last time MacDonald and Eddy neither very good actors but terrific singers would be together playing up the innocence and clean-cut romance that they were known for. After that you may need a cold shower not because there are any steamy scenes here but to get rid of the memory.',neg
'I totally agree with the review by a reviewer of Variety that the film is never quite as funny lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant. Narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic. If the film is supposed to be character-driven the poor lighting doesnt enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many non-South Africans will have difficulty in following the spoken English in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. I watched the film at the Cape Town World Cinema festival last year. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past. Unfortunately Bunny Chow wont be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history. Not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in Durban and Gauteng. It has clearly limited appeal among South African audiences.',neg
'Although unusually in colour for a second string oater the vivid clothes of the lead females fails to bring any life to the flatly directed screenplay. The plot revolves around the Youngers newly released on parole attempting to go straight but being pursued by a vengeful ex-Pinkerton man (a scenery chewing Fred Clark) and a femme fatale determined to involve them in her bank robbery schemes whether they want to or not. As Cole Younger Wayne Morris is big and hunky enough but his  cool demeanour and wooden acting skills undermine things. The standard of action is frankly no better than a Gene Autry or Roy Rogers TV episode with Colt .45s that never need reloading and uncanny shooting skills that allow a horse rider to shoot from the hip and wound a man from at least 50 feet...oh dear...',neg

'The film has weird annoying characters strange unexplainable slapstick and an insurmountable amount of dialogue about smoking. The movie has a contrived plot of a bitchy empty-headed womans (Jeanne Tripplehorn) search for love. Although who would ever like Jeannes character personality or reading of the dialogue I really cannot say. Except that she likes to smoke.<br /><br />Sarah Jessica Parker gives an interesting character performance (who likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott does his best to look pretty and soulful (as he smokes). And hey what is Jennifer Aniston doing there? Oh shes not really in it enough for anyone to care about her. (But she likes to smoke).<br /><br />This is a waste of anyones time. I dont even know how I was able to sit through as much of the movie as I did. I cant even believe I spent the time to write this except to warn others of its banality. Anyone need a cigarette?',neg
'I dont hand out ten star ratings easily. A movie really has to impress me and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours.<br /><br />From the moment that the opening title appeared I knew we were in for a ride. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here once again: the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera. However for me that last one was never a problem. I think it adds to the suspense.<br /><br />I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD simply because it is genius. It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy.',pos

'A root canal without anesthesia is more amusing. This movie is disturbing and pointless. There is absolutely nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot line. What in Gods name were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie? The acting in this movie is so incredibly bad - even from actors who are usually pretty damn good. The In-Laws is a funny movie. The Birdcage is a hilarious movie. The Big Lebowski is a humorous movie. This movie is just dumb. I cannot even begin to fathom the kind of sick mind it takes to write the novel that this movie is based on. I honestly cannot think of even one nice thing to say about this movie. It just doesnt make any sense. People please - I beg of you - do not see this movie. You will regret it for the rest of your life. This movie is not the worst ever made but it is definitely right up there on the top of the list.',neg
'I never saw Doctor Who before (at least not in any focused way) so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. Its funny (it really also ought to say Comedy in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value) its well-written and its making a meager budget go a long way. The human dimension is very strong and engaging which is very rare in current TV shows.<br /><br />Ive seen the first eight episodes and #6-8 were my favorites so far. Even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up (with time-travel saving ones dead parents and that sort of stuff) works out amazingly well here.<br /><br />Christopher Eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light-hearted though occasionally morose Doctor - if they can find a good replacement for him Ill be quite surprised. But Im willing to give the new guy a chance. Theres little doubt however that the Eccleston episodes are going to go down in history as classics.<br /><br />The relationship between the Doctor and Rose is particularly refreshing. The Doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them which however is much more emotional and human than sexual.<br /><br />A good show. The biggest drawback is the low budget - a show like this ought to have better special effects. And why they dont simply use some cheaper effects I dont know. In this day and age SFX dont have to cost a bundle - just look at the Star Wars: Revelations fan film.<br /><br />8 out of 10.',pos

'David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `House of Games a character study fraught with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel Driven. Still she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; theres an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve and it primes her vulnerability. When a patient Billy Hahn (Steven Goldstein) confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers and that theyre going to kill him if he doesnt pay she decides to intervene on his behalf. This takes her to the `House of Games a seedy little dive where she meets Mike (Joe Mantegna) a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world. Instead of the `twenty-five large that Billy claimed he owed Mike shows her his book and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars. And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean if shell agree to do him one simple favor which involves a card game he has going on in the back room. In the middle of a big hand Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone her job is to watch for the `tell of one of the other players. By this time not only Margaret but the audience as well is hooked. The dialogue and Mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines is mesmerizing. As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling surreal realm of existence and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game we are swept right along with her. From that first memorable encounter when he demonstrates what a `tell is and how it works to the lessons of the `short con to the stunning climax of this film Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless. And nothing is what it seems. In the end Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature and about herself. She changes; and whether or not its for the better is open to speculation. Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows and does. Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm self-assured exterior and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated. She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does and makes you understand it as well. The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum (Joey) Lilia Skala (Dr. Littauer) J.T. Walsh (The Businessman) Ricky Jay (George) and William H. Macy (Sergeant Moran). `House of Games is the quintessential Mamet; hes written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since and will no doubt grace us with more in the future. But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up. Youll find it under `Perfection. This is one great movie you do not want to miss. I rate this one 10/10.',pos

'First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if theyre all the result of inbreeding.<br /><br />Now I will say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they werent the most amazing movies that Id ever seen they were all right (and outright masterpieces compared to the three American Pie Presents films) I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?<br /><br />I also have a few other questions too.<br /><br />Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? <br /><br />who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)? <br /><br />And lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at Blockbuster or Wal Mart?<br /><br />There is so much wrong with this movie that I cant write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so Ill just touch on the biggest things wrong with it.<br /><br />The plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that I can see wrong with this movie is the acting.<br /><br />While most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years<br /><br />the one and only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer I know this isnt funny and Im wasting my talents but hey Im getting payed for it so who cares he doesnt even try to make any of his jokes funny (he really deserves better than this garbage). <br /><br />As I mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great TV shows Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating (there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseases)that you almost wish hed die a slow and painful death on screen Christopher McDonald (NCIS Law & Order) just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film.<br /><br />Maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the MPAA and get an R rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the X rating (the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating). <br /><br />Its interesting that twenty five years ago when Wes Craven submitted A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage (I believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it) to avoid getting an X rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldnt have been released <br /><br />but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the R rating today because its all done in the name of comedy if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded X rating.<br /><br />The last thing that really annoys me is the writing this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class.<br /><br />the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive this pie is filled with road apples.',neg
'I like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies. It is filled with Super-surfer Greg Nolls home movies and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion. Nevertheless it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory. It is filled with artistic talent and athletic talent however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic. Surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots. Nor are they surgeons(perhaps) or Ph.ds(again perhaps). It believes in the quest of the surfer. It believes in the beauty of human goofiness. It believes in the great gift of peace which comes from the cessation of war. Surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeroes fifteen years before. It celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous but only slightly historical. I suspect Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received. This movie has no military heroes. It has no guns. The only beach-head surfers conquer has a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It is the joy of exhalation.',pos
'as an actor I really like independent films but this one is amateur at best.<br /><br />The boys go to Vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes - palms no. And the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees.<br /><br />When the boys are leaving VT they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is Federal Express.

Come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur.<br /><br />The Christian brother is far gayer than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo. The two should have switched roles.<br /><br />The minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible.<br /><br />Applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time',neg
'Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and it stars Rick Hill who is some kind of body builder and famous of that if I have understood right? The plot follows as Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something back from the evil lord and he has to travel to the lords cave. He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey and the settings are very close to Tolkien and of course Conan the Barbarian. This is a rip off of huge success of Conan and even though this is very stupid film it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies!<br /><br />There are no many cinematic merits in this film. Couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating but what Deathstalker concentrates to show are nude females and huge muscles of Hill. Females are usually helpless victims and very stupid too so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists! The fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull and the monsters are not either anything special. And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done but what did you expect from low budget effort like this? This tries to be as great as Conan but fails pretty miserably. As I said this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else. This belongs to the category its so bad its great!<br /><br />Deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be and as a turkey film I appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys enjoyable ones of course! If bad films are your cup of tea then try this and have fun but if you dont understand enjoyably bad films then stay away. And if somebody cant stand large amount of nudity then stay away as well. There is more nudity here than violence and due to these scenes the film has an R rating. Otherwise this could be some safe PG family film!<br /><br />4/10',neg
'I really wanted to like this film but so much of it is stolen/borrowed from other work -- some of the borrowing is painfully blatant. The New York Times review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous Warner Brothers cartoon (Hello my baby hello my darlin hello my ragtime gal...). But I challenge anyone to watch the Fox/Blue Sky animated feature Robots (2005) and not find ridiculous similarities in: storyline - A young inventor growing up and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventions.<br /><br />cityscape - Extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments.<br /><br />...robots... - The servant robot in the Robinson household has a very similar design to those in Robots and both films use a sort of retro-futuristic look.<br /><br />All of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from Disney at the end implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicity).<br /><br />The filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction as though we dont have the attention span for anything less.<br /><br />The villain is really well-designed and brilliantly animated and hes a pleasure to watch. Much of the rest of the film seems thrown-together. Some of the landscapes look like CGI from the mid-90s.<br /><br />The film actually opens with a classic Mickey Mouse short. By the end of this cartoon we are reminded that Disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling -- they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue.',neg
'The story for Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anands mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in Kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt Prem Pujaris posters. But the life of hippies re ignited a story in Devs mind to be made into a film.<br /><br />This was Dev Anands perhaps best directorial effort. The film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and Zeenat Aman as Devs sister made a tremendous impact.<br /><br />This film was Dev Anands call to the nation to keep up their moral values.<br /><br />It is about a Montereal based Indian family and the brothers role is a very affectionate one for his sister. But the parents quarrel and separate leaving Prashant(Dev) with mother and Jasbir(Zeenat) with father. She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see Prashant again.<br /><br />She is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home. Dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with certain hippies.<br /><br />To reunite with his sister Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti(Mumtaz) who was to later marry him and also Janice who in reality is Jasbir with a new name and new identity. She has forgotten her childhood and Dev too.<br /><br />Dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in Kathmandu and the people are after his life.<br /><br />This was a story well directed and acted-both by Dev Anand. We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz. But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman but Burman Da did not want Dev to do the film. He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari though was good but had been opposed in Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite peoples anger against Dev. But Dev continued with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film was indeed a success.<br /><br />R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing the award winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number.<br /><br />Overall it is a good film.',pos
'Cyclone is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value even on the so bad its entertaining front. A friend of mine took the tape from an overflowing St. Vincent DePaul clothes bin. Okay that may be a little bit dodgy but it was meant to be a clothes bin not a crappy old VHS bin something the less fortunate members of our society dont really need to make their lives better. It could be considered a mercy. Watching a movie like Cyclone would really only add to their problems. Anyway the basic premise of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle that it armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers isnt even properly exploited. The two high speed chase sequences involve vehicles travelling at less than hair raising speeds of around 40 KMPH and a super-fast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by a crappy old station wagon is not that awe inspiring when you get down to it. There is only one scene where the bikes goofy weaponry is used at the films climax and it is laughably ineffectual or just laughable when it is. This includes laser beams that look like they should be coming out of the hands of an evil wizard in a cheesy eighties sword and sorcery that produced large bursts of flame which seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly. The rest of the movie is just tedious hard to watch filler. Lots of bad actors yes even Combs and Landau suck in this most of whom seem like they have been lifted from the set of a porno movie stand around exchanging really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to pus forward the barely coherent plot. There are a few badly staged fight sequences and some excruciatingly unfunny comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of the motor cycle repair shop. Comedy of the sub Benny Hill horny old man cant stop staring at the female leads chest variety. Basically the money scenes involving the bike actually doing stuff are few and lame and the rest is clunky filler material. Skip it.',neg
'Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a director of gory horror movies who is starting to feel the effect of having filmed too many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his marbles; this proves to be a bad idea since the shrink is actually a crazy murderer responsible for a spate of grisly killings. Seizing the opportunity to make Fulci his fall guy the loopy nut doctor hypnotises the horror hack into thinking that he is responsible for the recent series of murders.<br /><br />On the surface Cat in the Brain appears to be a fantastically gory treat from spaghetti-splatter god Lucio Fulci. Chock full of chainsaw dismemberment axe attacks and various other bloody killings the film certainly spills enough claret for even the most hardened gore-hounds. But when one looks closer it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are lifted from earlier movies (mostly Fulcis own masterpieces); remove these from the equation and one is left with a nifty basic plot idea that is totally wasted some welcome nudity and dreadful performances from Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as the psycho shrink.<br /><br />As the film progresses it develops into an incomprehensible mess with the borrowed gore footage inserted randomly with no attempt at working it convincingly into the story. If youve seen Fulcis Touch of Death and Ghosts of Sodom or Mario Bianchis the Murder Secret then youve already seen the best bits of Cat In The Brain before.<br /><br />After much bloodletting the film wraps itself up rather quickly leaving the viewer feeling bewildered and somewhat cheated. Watch the film if youre a Fulci completist but I would suggest seeking out the films from which the good bits were taken.',neg
'How to take Charles Darwins fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flick. His pivotal and seminal ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are untouched except for two brief scenes in one of which it is claimed he is killing God; pure demagoguery to make the movie emotional. And the rest of the movie buckles to that purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overloud music at which one is beholden to cry. Anyone who actually read Origin Of Species would be vividly aware that there was no breach with God in any of Darwins work; to the contrary there was an increased awe and respect and a revolutionary new way of looking at things. A good movie about Darwin could be educational thoughtful and deeply inspiring even in a religious sense - but that would contradict the soap-opera intentions of this flick. This is a flick that is designed to make people wail in contrived sympathy and then feel transformed although unable to understand why; it makes fast use of Darwins great name only as marketing clout as one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression. Sad that the sets and costumes are so good: production values except for the writing were obviously high. See it if you want to weep for the loss of intelligence in American literature.',neg
'I really liked this movie. I watched it last night on the Public Broadcasting System. The part I liked about it was the fact that they dealt with issues of today not in the future or the past. They basically had some terrorists take a van or two and rent them out to be car bombs. I think what the movie could have showed was people in different countries at the same time. It did show the fact that England or any other country isnt prepared for an attack on the magnitude that they showed. I have never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie so I cant really say if they are normally their parts. After the movie they had this panel of experts talking about if something like that could happen here in the U.S. It was a thought-provoking discussion!',pos
'At times I really wonder when I look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than I have. Ive just seen it... and liked it. Not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film!<br /><br />The film needs some patience yes. And yes the main character is REALLY annoying but that Im sure is by intention.<br /><br />Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home. Most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music. This movie definitely doesnt fit as background noise.<br /><br />And no. Good directing doesnt mean having five laughs or explosions a second. Good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together. And while that doesnt work out perfectly at least I think it works quite good.<br /><br />I liked the photography and sets even if they brink on the surreal at times. The opening scene is really special.<br /><br />I also liked the acting  Guillaume Depardieu is NOT playing Pierre. He is acting the role of a Pierre who is himself playing a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be he is a presumptuous and self-righteous idiot a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect. That even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself.<br /><br />People are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff: No character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone.<br /><br />And even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen: Remember that Isabelle fled from a war zone - and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war most likely Bosnia (which was still going on when the film was produced). At least thats what is hinted at by the story Isabelle tells Pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover which is surrounded by books on Bosnia.',pos
'A true story about a true revolution 25 of April ; a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years that was imposing a colonial war on its militarys for maintaining an empire (Angola Mozambique Guine-Bissau Cabo Verde S.

'I happen to be the directors nephew. Its taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and I can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle doesnt even have a copy of it anymore (I asked). Im looking forward to bringing him a copy.<br /><br />Currently the films average rating is 1.9/10. As far as I can tell that should put it somewhere in the mid-30s in the IMDb bottom 100 however with only 206 votes it hasnt yet placed.<br /><br />Its sad that the film doesnt even get the respect of a bottom 100 title.<br /><br />Anyhow Im giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts.

'I checked this movie out when it still had 6 votes and it said like 7.2 or something but seriously this is a horrible movie. Lets break it down. The first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a hand-held digital camera owned by a freshman at a community college. the next thing youll notice is that the actors are all friends of said freshman (he probably met them at the pub the night before. Third on the list you will notice that the musical editing is horrible and they try to cram many songs into this movie at 30 second intervals... also all digital editing is done on said freshmans home PC... probably using windows movie maker. This movie was horrible... pretentious had an undeniably bad script and acting that followed suit. I wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone I know but I do sentence the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity.',neg
'Hilarious from start to finish theres got to be great courage to handle the theme of death with a smile specially when two funeral parlors are battling for control of the market: a classic parlor and a revolutionary one where every funeral is a show lead by Christopher Walken a treat in the role of the visionary american mortitian. But the rest of the cast is great also and this one is another success that only UK is capable of making. Surprising among the ensemble cast is Naomi Watts that strikes in another metamorphosis (accent included). Always sporting a smile on its face it seems like a paradox that there could be so much comedy to be taken from a movie that could be called Four Funerals and One Wedding but youll understand when you see it.',pos
'Convoluted infuriating and implausible Fay Grim is hard to sit through but Parker Posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it. Shes at once touchingfunny cunning. The supporting actors commit to it as well.<br /><br />I wont even try to tell you the plot.. It involves characters from Hartleys Henry Fool and attempts a tale of international espionage.<br /><br />The film works well if you continue along with it-understanding it is. in a sense completely ridiculous. It becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along.

In the end it offers something that defies description.',pos
'I was really looking forward to watching this documentary on what I considered to be some of the most entertaining films ever made. Growing up in L.A. during the 60s many of these old black and white films were shown on the local stations. I even remember a Friday night show called Strange Tales of Science Fiction that showcased a different Sci Fi flick every week. This documentary however spent way too much time on the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic movies of that genre and how they used them as inspiration in their filmaking.<br /><br />That is not what I was hoping for in this documentary. It really could have been a comprehensive examination of the decade instead of a brief highlighting of the most well known films of the era. Anyone who has studied or been interested in these films are pretty familiar with standouts such as War of the Worlds Forbidden Planet The Thing The Day the Earth Stood Still etc. I would have liked to see some excerpts from lesser known films and perhaps some interviews with people involved in the making of these movies. I would have to agree the documentary was way too focused on Spielbergs opinions and was a type of commercial for his new release of War of the Worlds.',pos
'There is great detail in A Bugs Life. Everything is covered. The film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping. The film isnt too terribly orignal its basically a modern take on Kurosawas Seven Samurai only with bugs.

The grasshoppers are menacing and Hopper the lead bad guy was a brillant creation. Check this one out.',pos

'Maybe if youve never read any English literature or only ever watched the Hollywood version of any book you might find merit in this awful film. It has the directorial and scripting skill of Shoreditch. The BBC 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy very well.<br /><br />The characters in this production are badly miscast Sutherland as Bennet seems a total buffoon. Bingley likewise acts the fool and it is imcomrepnsible that he my be a friend of Darcy. I cant imagine how Judi Dench could have accepted the role maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version.<br /><br />Quotes from the book are thrown in out of context. Huge chunks are missing the important episode with Wickham is glossed over.<br /><br />Mr Collins is however very good and towers above the other members of the cast.<br /><br />The only good thing is we didnt pay to see it.

'This has got to be THE worst Steven Segal movie I have ever watched (even worse than eco-piffle like On Deadly Ground & Fire Down Below). Ill start with the good points... Its got stylish direction for a DTV movie and has wonderful scenry... Thats it! The story dosent really go anywhere its just an array of well staged set pieces just so seagal go shoot bad guys (the body count can easily match Tarantino at his bloodiest!). The plot is needlessly complicated and confusing you forget who the good and bad guys are. The acting (I use the term loosely) is mediocre at best seagals usual ONE constipated expression and wooden acting I can take but the others especially the Brits were down right terrible.<br /><br />Whats in the package? Why are bad guys after it? Is seagal being set up?<br /><br />WHO GIVES A S***!<br /><br />When I rented this movie at my local Blockbuster (Once id paid) the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the shop I could have picked! (I felt like punching him till my arm went numb)<br /><br />Anyway I havent seen Half Past Dead or Out for a kill yet and i darent go back for more humiliation at my store but they cant be anyworse than this turkey<br /><br />The soundtrack is supposed to be young and hip - It just gave me a suuden urge for half a dozen asprins.<br /><br />All in all this is Seagal at his WORST! The guy whos gained about 100Ibs and looks well past it hes a guy who just doesnt no when to stop he should retire gracefully NOW! and have a go behind the camera or become a Martial arts teacher or something.<br /><br />My rating 2/10 (1 point for scenery)',neg

I discovered one small oops: in the second movie Skylark Jacob is reminiscing when he was a boy and tells Sarah my brothers and sisters and I would dream.... In Winters End those brothers and sisters dont exist in conversations between Jacob and his father. But it is a very small oops and I only caught it watching the trilogy the second time around.

'At first sight Whos Singing Over There just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy with only a kind of unusual quiet and slow motion : what a mistake ! <br /><br />Beginning with two singers on a desert landscape then a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors it hides a gem !<br /><br />The folded story and a false rhythm induces you to think yes it is comic but just lets you guess it will be a gentle kind of movie. <br /><br />Not at all : very funny by instant dark subtle cynical on others its development surprises you all along the story Very ingeniously and cleverly presented all the characters are important and the actors give them full life.<br /><br />And what is astonishing its based on deep observation great mastering of the camera work and has a great meanings and really everything the general direction and how also the details are presented that it simply makes you forget its a movie: it is like to watch a kind human society you yet dont knowshot by a friend behind a camera.<br /><br />And youre the one behind him. It is simple and simply exceptional !<br /><br />Dont misunderstand me; in no way that would means the script  the quality of picture the music score have a kind of amateurish way no no ! Its great Art ! <br /><br />Because it flows like a river From high up in the mountain down to the sea with all the different sort of grounds and peregrinations that a real river will face on its journey to the sea from a tiny thing to a main stream.<br /><br />This metaphoric image I used is the very best way I can find to explain all the charm that has Whos Singing Over There. For me again I take the hammer : simply exceptional...<br /><br />Ive seen that The Director is the one who made Chat Blanc/Chat Noir which I know is quiet famous But as I yet didnt see it I had no idea about this gentleman.<br /><br />Others reviewers wrote dithyrambical comments on that film I fully agree !<br /><br />European Eastern Cinema is not well know because seldom translated but I am lucky to have this exemplar one in original language with good English subtitles. All in all : deep delicious and exceptional...<br /><br />For fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffs avoid it at any cost it may be too subtle and good for you !<br /><br />But if youre interested in different genres and/or classics I guess you wont regret this one and in case of buying it will have good companionship in your personal DVD library with such no less than merited big names like Billy Wilder Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry among some of my preferred directors .

'Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film then changes track cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks youve ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino direction by Rodriguez two guys who have previously shown talent but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it. But it doesnt quite work that way. Youre only good while you continue doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: Just what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? Clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy  utterly ruthless and efficient  and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But of course we never do. And the Clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. Thats not clever or witty thats just bad bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout and no wonder. Did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead? Tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he as writer assume we would find the rape gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny). On every level  except the technical  this film stinks. Avoid.',neg
'This movie has Wild Bill Hickok Calamity Jane Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and you can hardly recognize him. This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time. This movie starts out with Lincolns assassination and it also deals with an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home. This movie also deals with Custers last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and i usually dont like Jean Arthur but i liked her here.',pos
'Prime Suspect 4 continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4 PS5 & PS6) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits. Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age loneliness indiscretions a host of personal and professional problems and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal. PS4 conjures two stories while PS5 & PS6 are single episodes each which find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good. In other words to prevail Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces something which makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series yet grayer and the Tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers. Very good stuff which only gets better from series to series. (B+)',pos
'Speed which I believe is direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular (I havent watched this one) gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days but then gets in a very boring draw at the end. I have watched this movie today on 12th January 2008 on rented VCD. Its release date is 19th Oct 2007. But still fortunately for me I didnt know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office. So in this situation when I watch the movie I feel that this movie could have been a very good movie but then the director again falls in the trap for Bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chance.<br /><br />Off course as a Bhatt movie it must be copied from somewhere else. But now days it doesnt matter for me if I havent seen the original movie. I just found the main theme much similar to Nick of Time and Badshah. In the movie Sanjay Suri is shown an intelligence agent but his wife thinks that he is a chef. This brings back the memory of True-Lies. The only new part was the use if the phone. But that too I found out now is taken from movie Cellular. So when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies its future is quite clear.<br /><br />The things I like about the movie is its pace. As the name suggest the things really happens fast and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes. But this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum dhishum.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is also quite interesting. Three stories going parallel one after the other. One of the kidnapping of Urmila the other of the Zayed trying to help Urmila and then the plan of murder of prime minister. These three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continues.<br /><br />But then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie. Except Sanjay Suri none other makes any impression. This goes even for Urmila who is always promising in RGVs movies. Due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesnt really convey the feelings that director wanted. E.g. the scene at the end where Urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone should have made a good impact. But instead we just wait for the end of that scene.<br /><br />Other than acting some unnecessary love for style demoralizes the movie. Showing so cool villains is good for Hollywood movies not for Bollywood The background of London is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen. Especially at the end all those dhishhum- dhishhum were utterly unnecessary. May be director has an impression that the climax in Hindi movies must have such fights. They look unrealistic increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie ends.<br /><br />Over and all I find the movie once watchable. If it is coming on TV or you can get it on rent its OK. But then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy. Next time when the movie is on TV you can safely watch other channels.',neg
'It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it. The production was good; however the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors. The good actors didnt hold their own nor did they lift up the others. <br /><br />This movie is not worthy of more words but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. <br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment I still wouldnt recommend this movie.',neg
'I gotta go with my boy Allen (who also reviewed this film)...ZOMBIE GANGBANGERS (as my copy is entitled - guess they left out the NINJA part after realizing there isnt a single ninja nor reference to ninjas anywhere in the whole f!cking film...) is a total wasted of time. Honestly one of the most boring retarded films Ive ever had the displeasure of viewing.<br /><br />A hooker is repeatedly (un-graphically) raped by two zombies and then by a cop (again un-graphically) when the cop doesnt believe her story.

'Theres so little here of the fantastic Anne Rice book that what IS here makes no sense. Some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--dont make it to the screen at all and those who do are watered down to the point that theres no reason for their existence.<br /><br />Wheres the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Wheres the continued affair between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all since her storys never explained? Wheres the rape and redemption of Marie whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end with Marcels beating at the hands of his father? We learn nothing of Aglae beyond that shes a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hatred? <br /><br />As for the performances theres not a one thats better than mediocre though thats likely due to the lousy script. Best of the lot is that of the actor playing Richard--but Richards not on screen enough to salvage the film. Worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose though again it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little shes given to work with.<br /><br />All in all this is just terrible.

( Cases in point: Mister Magoo The Avengers - awful! )<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd whom I normally enjoy was so miserably miscast in this role. His manic portrayal of our beloved Uncle Martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal. His ranting groaning grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character.<br /><br />The director must have thought that fast movements screaming dialogue and one-take slapstick had some similarity to comedy. Apparently he told EVERY ACTOR to act as if they had red ants in their pants.<br /><br />Fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script. I think the writer used Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World as an example of a fine comedy script. As manic as that 1963 classic is it is far superior to this claptrap - in fact - suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison.<br /><br />What is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children. I just am not sure whose children it was made for. Certainly no self-respecting card-carrying child I know!<br /><br />If they HAD to remake My Favorite Martian why didnt they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic? <br /><br />Unfortunately IMDB.com cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty.<br /><br />One good thing did come from this movie the actors and crew were paid - I think.',neg
'Love it or loathe it its hard to not find Warren Beattys take on Dick Tracy the 1990 film adaptation of Chester Goulds famous comic strip anything short of a genre classic. Superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years and may soon become a genre all on its own.<br /><br />Beattys film liberally uses Goulds source material to full effect shooting in all six of the strips primary colors and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger-happy mutant gangsters and loose seductive women a lush visual style and tone.<br /><br />It can be stated that the films strong visual aesthetics drastically short-change the characters and their acting abilities which I dont think can be any further from the truth.<br /><br />Dick Tracy relishes in its look and ghastly characters and Beatty himself who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs.<br /><br />Other than the visual treats and Oscar-winning makeup there is a plot and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino deliciously over-the-top in an Oscar-nominated performance) seeks to eliminate Tracy in one well-planned move but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him.<br /><br />Tracy meanwhile is juggling his relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly) who as her name would have it remains faithfully by his side and cares for The Kid (Charlie Korsmo) who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime-busting hero. Tracys fidelity to Tess is tested by the tempting advances of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) who is also Big Boys main squeeze. At the same time that all of this is going down things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town and decides to play both sides against the middle.<br /><br />The performances are good as Beattys focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects. Pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role thats truly standout from the rest.<br /><br />Dick Tracy is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre. I think that if Chester Gould was still alive he would be proud of Warren Beattys take on his beloved crime-fighting detective.<br /><br />8/10',pos

'Paul Verhoevens predecessor to his breakout hit Basic Instinct is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller. Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why. The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve (played by Jeroen Krabbé); a gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. While there he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag (Renée Soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kills him.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself and that is one of things I like best about him. This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards (and that doesnt happen very often!). I wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work...but youll see what I mean when you see the film (make sure you get the uncut version!). There is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one Ive mentioned but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions another one has a pipe sent through his skull a boat is smashed in half...lovely.<br /><br />The acting in The Fourth Man isnt anything to write home about but its solid throughout. Jeroen Krabbé holds the audiences attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. It is Renée Soutendijk that impresses the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct but the original fatale did it best. Paul Verhoevens direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story. Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and its a shame that he doesnt put it to better use. Of all the Verhoeven films Ive seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me its worth the effort.',pos
'I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called. now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a little hazy I was in no way disappointed by what I saw. the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone. But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike. with a floating island a mad general a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down I would recommend this film to any one.',pos

'Of course seeing a few boom mikes doesnt mean anything does it? Lord Rudy Ray Moore and DUrville Martin really put this one together didnt they? I laughed a lot as often happens in these types of movies but I dont know what I was supposed to laugh at because I laughed at so many other things. I am not saying the movie was bad but I will say that a little more editing would have done wonders. I am a huge fan of Blaxploitation so I dont think that it was horrid but I know that The Human Tornado was several times better than this. I think that those who can make it through this movie might need a Colt 45 or two afterward. I mean it really helps you to not notice the boom mikes when you watch it again.',pos
'Like Tarzan the Ape Man (1932) only more so. Theres more of everything more animals more varied African tribes and scenes in which the thought must be if this was good with three or four lions forty would be better. Tarzan wrestles with crocodilesthe the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin around and around jaws flapping. Tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals. His friends are real chimps people wearing larger ape costumes and elephants. In fact they use Indian elephantsfar more friendly and trainable than African oneswith costume ears attached to their heads. The human story: another white man worse than the rest shows up to join with Holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard. Tarzan wont show them the way so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed. Tarzan intercedes and the bad guy shoots himbut of course he survives and returns to save Jane. Everybody else dies Holt and the bad guy and every single one of their boys. People are expendable especially Africans and there doesnt seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them. This must be the last Tarzan movie before the Hays Code made Jane wear more clothes. There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims nude and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing. Apparently one of Weismullers friends from the Olympic swim team did the nude scenes and not Maureen OSullivan. She however moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth Weismuller wears (plus a bikini top) showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip. They still dont need to talk a lot. They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities. No wonder theyre happy.',pos
'Random Hearts snuck up on me. Criticized for the implausibility of a) the premise and b) the pairing of an IA cop and a Congresswoman as well as for its slowness the film felt just fine to me  and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing. I found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between Fords and Thomass lives as they first found out about and dealt in very different ways in very different environments with their spouses deaths and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people. It could happen; two peoples philandering spouses could be on the same plane the plane could go down the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath. So what if its improbable? Improbable is not the same as far-fetched. So..what if it did happen? Why not speculate? <br /><br />Fords and Thomass performances are believable and nuanced. Instead of finding their coupling implausible (opposite sides of the tracks--give me a break) I felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew how to deal with. The script does not bring them together too soon or too easily and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally either. Where I find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the ramifications of the situation personal and professional but never seems to pursue any of them very far. And if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard Harrison Ford does seem about 10 years too old for the part.<br /><br />For five and a half bucks at Wal-Mart with full length director commentary and behind-the-scenes featurette the DVD is well worth owning. I dont think I would pay $20 for it on a bet but my wife might. OK ten...',pos
'This movie is such a piece of unbelievable crap. First let me talk about the pros: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit.<br /><br />Now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad. We have said computer programmer Angela Bennett (whos online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY!!! I bet the directors cheered over that one for an hour) who basically checks other Companys software for errors/glitches etc. So we start with her ordering pizza on the Internet and then putting on a fireplace on her monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown thus far). This is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key. This is apparently a HUGE problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file.<br /><br />Any event we move on. She gets this call from some other bloke (that works at the same company) and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret Internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected top secret data woohoo! Angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this loophole are out to get her. This of course is only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys only BEFORE he tries to kill her BEFORE she jumps in the ocean off his boat BEFORE she winds up in a random hospital.<br /><br />Problem #1: You cant create a loophole on the Internet to gain access to a bunch of top secret FBI data. Where the hell did this come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the Internet (even in 95)? Problem #2: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would release her. She could not just pack her things and go.<br /><br />Then these hackers or whatever change Angelas ID so she cant get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her ID is gone. So she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on.<br /><br />Apparently all police and FBI people are stupid and dont believe her. So then she has to utilize a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling in for her is) and get back to her old computer. She starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some BS IP address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe.<br /><br />Then she runs to some center to mail all this information to the FBI. She apparently HAS to use a mainframe to email stuff to the FBI. But then the same fool that tried to kill her BEFORE throwing her in the water catches her and easily hacks into the FBI again (wtf?). But remember that cool virus? Well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on software it now works on the entire system too. It brings down the whole mainframe which has all the fake information because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of some convention... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP! Anyway the now uber virus works and Angela (the real one now) runs away and later kills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher. He of course has a gun runs up to her so hes like 2 feet away and then decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood.<br /><br />All in all this movie is so full of BS and crap. Anyone who doesnt know a lot about computers will be wildly fooled into thinking this crap is possible but not one thing is accurate concerning computers or the net. And I honestly doubt Id see a multiplatform virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (*cough LMAO*).',neg
'First off this is an excellent series though we have sort of a James Bond effect. What I mean is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006 it is chronologically the first adventure of 007 Dr. No (1962) being the second while in Golden Eye the first film with Pierce Brosnan Judi Dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male M so how could she have been in place in the beginning before Bond became a double-0 aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older? This is more or less a poetic license to thrill. We need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained. No the new Star Trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago. In the 1960s communicators were fantasy. (now we call them cell phones) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons. OMG do you think 400 years from now they would have perfected Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? So please lets give the producers some leeway.<br /><br />But to try and make things a bit consistent let us just ponder about the Cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of Battlestar Galactica. If that is the case where did all the Cylons that populated the original earth come from? We know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. Well what happened if one of the Cyclon ships at war with the Caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship loaded with human-looking Cylons wound up not only jumping through space but through time back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Earth One. They colonized it found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves but not before they themselves sent out a ragtag fleet to search for the legendary Caprica only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet which they colonized to become the humans who eventually invented the Cylons. Time paradox? Of course. Which came first the chicken or the road? Who cares? Its fraking entertaining!',pos
'Made me wish my own happy birds could talk. Tisk tisk on the reviewer who dissed the movie. A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. Paulie is a lovable little treasure. He has quite a few clever lines that truly made me laugh. I especially loved the dance sequences during his showbiz stint. You can forgive the obvious clichés as you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with Marie. A charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner. Would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey. I liked her artistic and poetic inspirations a shame she could not share Paulies reunion. Bless Paulie in his new home at last with Marie perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.',pos
'This is a semi fictional memoir of an international man who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent 30 years.<br /><br />I was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war. I was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting. However I was disappointed by this film. Chico seemed fragmentary with the main character Ricardo staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. As could be expected no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. The excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in various countries.',neg
'Gentleman Jim not really a boxing film. It is a vehicle for Errol Flynn as Jim Corbett. But having said that the boxing scenes are a real eye-opener to the modern viewer. There are no 12 round points decisions here.<br /><br />Errol Flynn plays the Irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title. Flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable Corbett. His opponent John Sullivan is still better however a bruiser of the old school played by Ward Bond.<br /><br />The theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance. Corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new persona as Gentleman Jim. Jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egotist. Sullivan the heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character.<br /><br />There is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all. And Errol Flynn gets the girl.',pos
'Looking for a movie for your Turkey Film Festival? THE ROLLER BLADE SEVEN is on my list of the ten worst films of all-time. The plot the story of a post-Apocalyptic roller blading samurai warrior is a convoluted hodge-podge of film references of everything from STAR WARS to THE SEVEN SAMAURI. The acting fluctuates from bland to abysmal. The scene where the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to the point of jeering laughter. Frank Stalones Black Knight reminds one too much of John Cleeses Black Knight in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL. (Word of Advice Frank: When you stoop to doing a movie like this one your career is over.) I chanced upon this little stink-bomb on a low-end cable channel and I could not stop watching. It is like watching a train wreck you just cant look away.',neg
'Michelle Rodrigez was made for this movie when I first saw her in Fast and the Furious. You could tell that she was a tough woman. With this movie she has not only proven her acting but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie. She is more a bad girl and thats what I like about her. This movie is about a troubled girl living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family. As she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers trainer to train her. Even though they dont think she has the potential they get to be shown proven wrong.<br /><br /> I think this movie was a little slow at the ending but was well done. It shows that people can do anything even if they dont think you have the potential. I recommend it to be seen.',pos
'I just saw If I can remember the advertisements for the movie from 1968 so I was interested in finally seeing it. It may be the perspective of an American who never went to a British public school and misses some of the social references but I thought the movie was awful. For one thing as others have pointed out it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooed-at-the-time revolt to break out. For another whether the last scene is real or imagined what occurs isnt a revolt but a shooting rampage. Theres quite a difference.<br /><br />I know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events but one cannot avoid doing it here. One person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the end of movie to the incidents at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if theres a scintilla of difference between Klebold Harris and Cho on the one hand and Travis (Malcom McDowell) on the other I simply cant see it. All four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a f___-ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for.<br /><br />Which brings me to: why the hell are Travis and his chums even in a school they so despise? They are adults or close to it. Theyre not in a military prison like the inmates in The Hill a much better British film from about the same time. No one is forcing them to go to College and take beatings from the the whips except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake-up about the nature of their sons. I had the opportunity in college to join a frat except I couldnt stand to be given silly cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective brothers. I took the consequences of not having the in with the Establishment that frats provide and I cant say I regretted it.<br /><br />If Travis fancies himself the second coming of Lenin (whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in his room) hes free to go out and organize a fitters union or work for Michael Foot in the next election. If he wants to be Jack Kerouac then get on the road and start writing. What possible benefit is he giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in his room?<br /><br />Sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in Last Tango In Paris where Brando mopes about having had to go on a date with cow manure on his shoes. In the real world the person said a listener would say Why didnt you scrape it off? Change your shoes? --Dont allow fictional characters to lay a self-pity trip on you because you dont dare point out an common-sense alternative course of action for them. So it is here.',neg

The storytelling doesnt follow a comprehensive intelligibly way everything is a mess. The action and the dialogs appear at jumps. The thing that disappointed me most was to see Dominique Pinon one of my French favorite actors involved in this uh I dont even know how to describe it without being polite The rest of the actors where at the most poor. Susan Paterno made a terrible interpretation of her character making a flat inexpressive performance. Poor special effects.

'The opening shot was the best thing about this movie because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate well-crafted independent film. Damn that opening shot for filling me hope. As the film progressed in a slow plodding manner my thoughts were varied in relation to this film: Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors have to PAY the director to be in this film? Did I get my ticket validated at the Box Office? Yes dear reader. I saw this film in the Theatre! This would be the only exception I will make about seeing a film at home over a Movie Theatre because at home you can TURN IT OFF. Were there any redeeming values? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college nerd had his moments especially in a dog collar. Other than that this film went from trying to be a comedy to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter. It succeeded on none of these fronts. Oh and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.',neg
'Some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the steps in the Odessa staircase sequence. These men are not Cossacks but regular army troops.<br /><br />The Cossacks arrive at the scene a little later and they are the men on horses slashing at the crowd with their sabers.<br /><br />To experts on Russian history: Correct me on this if Im wrong.<br /><br />But there are a couple of lines in the movie that apparently no one has commented on. After the takeover of the Potemkin someone in the crowd on shore says Kill the Jews! This is on screen for only a couple of seconds but it is there.<br /><br />How cruelly typical of history not just in Russia but in so many other countries to immediately unthinkingly and instinctively blame Jews for any domestic trouble!<br /><br />Perhaps other parts of the movie are not historically factual but the outcry against the Jews is all too real. Comments anyone?<br /><br />Also why cant speakers of English learn to pronounce the name as Potyomkin instead of as Potemkin? Theres a need in Russian to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of e: as either ye or as yo. Sometimes two dots are used to distinguish these two pronunciations but usually the difference simply has to be memorized.',pos
'Time spent watching this film was time wasted. I do not dislike science fiction. I do not reject any genre per se since good work can be done in any genre. This film however is not good work. I cannot fault the visuals (when not involving alien makeups) and the special effects are impressive. The story was not out-and-out BAD for a trekkish comic book. But the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers interest/attention/money went. The direction alternated between sluggish and confusing (one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture). The acting was mostly very bad indeed. There was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of It was that way on the page and the director told me I was supposed to be mad/sad/scared/whatever. Okay so it was a SF series pilot. Since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium. Im astonished the pilot sold the series. Or is the money also in the hands of technerds?',neg
'Its hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a Norwegian immigrant and would be chemist had on the American public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was viewed. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary individual who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure Catholic college on the map.<br /><br />Ive heard clips of Rocknes famous pep talks and it is uncanny how Pat OBrien got the voice and the inflection perfectly. In what turned out to be his career role Pat OBrien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was Rockne. Rockne is assisted by well by Gale Page as Bonnie Stiles Rockne who complained about her home being a training camp for Notre Dame but never threw anyone out of her house.<br /><br />Rocknes first impact on football was as a player with Notre Dame not a coach. One fine day in the second half of a losing football game against heavily favored Army Rockne and team mate Gus Dorais played by Owen Davis used the forward pass as an offensive weapon. Before that football was simply a game where you just got bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense. Rockne didnt invent the forward pass but he popularized and football became a game of strategy as well as brawn after that. <br /><br />Rockne knew how to work the media also. Those well publicized pep talks of his were not just to inspire his players. They were well publicized and it was in a lot due to him that college football became a major sport in that Golden Age of Sports in the Roaring Twenties. <br /><br />Playing a small but key role is Ronald Reagan. As George Gipp the first player Rockne coached to achieve greatness Reagan not only got a good performance but forever after a name that was handy in his subsequent political career. That deathbed scene which Rockne swore was accurate became a Republican battle cry as many a GOP underdog went out to win one for the Gipper.<br /><br />I still remember a widely distributed photograph in 1981 that was one of the first of recovering President Ronald Reagan at Notre Dames graduation with his old friend Pat OBrien. Reagan always credited OBrien and Dick Powell of all the Warner Brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the kindest and most encouraging to a young player on the lot trying to make good.<br /><br />Notre Dame itself owes its prestige to Rockne. Its quite possible that Notre Dame would be an obscure small Catholic College without the reputation that football brought to it.<br /><br />Though George Gipp and the later famous backfield of the Four Horsemen certainly had their place in the sun it was Rockne who had the reputation. Its no accident that Warner Brothers was able to get Amos Alonzo Stagg Glenn Pop Warner Howard Jones and William Spaulding Rocknes contemporaries and coaches with great reputations in their own right to appear in Knute Rockne All American. It was there way of honoring the guy who was number one in their profession.<br /><br />I think more than football fans will enjoy Knute Rockne All American. Though you might become one after seeing the film.',pos
'Heres the good news first. Spirit is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release. The artwork and effects are revolutionary and I recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone.<br /><br />And now for the bad news. I really mean it when I say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it. You may remember that Spirit got badly trounced by Lilo and Stitch last summer. The first person who argues that it was because Disney is more well-established and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled Why Lilo and Stitchs Script Didnt Stink.<br /><br />For all the incredible new animation technology on display in Spirit the story is almost *astonishingly* dull. There is a lesson here and (needless to say) it doesnt just apply to animated movies. You can have the most mind-blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal but if your story is boring and more importantly we dont care about your characters its bad film-making. Simple as that. The animation is still mind-blowing; I just cant wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it.',neg

All kidding aside a friend and I were awake in the middle of the night watching movies on the Encore: Action channel when we came across a series of sci-fi-esquire flicks. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad...not bad at all) ... then Judge Dredd (Stalone almost ruins his career) then a movie called Lethal Target. One would think the title Lethal Target could only be awarded to a really cool and really cheesy Rambo knock-off.

I get it ... in space it MUST have been a fashion statement.... well then... WHYOH WHY does the main character pull out a 3.5 floppy disk at one point in the film so that she can upload some bullshit ?! wtf !? ...weve progressed so far that we have space travel but we still havent progressed past 1.44megabytes of space..?<br /><br />I guess Im just asking for too much.<br /><br />Question two Lets just say...that yes... this is a softcore porn.

'Nick Cage is Gates a treasure hunter (oh excuse me... treasure protector whatever that means) who is descended from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors had been given a clue to the whereabouts of a huge treasure that our Founding Fathers most if not all Freemasons had decided to hide because they just didnt want to finance their Independence all that badly.<br /><br />The first clue turns out to be in a long-lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew consisting of financier Ian (Sean Bean) Movie Dork Riley (Justin Bartha of the immortal Gigli) and a couple of faceless lackeys enter the cargo hold of the ship. They immediately spill out tons of gunpowder all over the floor not that this is significant in any way. At last they find the clue (a skeleton is hovering over it) and it turns out to be a pipe with writing... on it. Sort of. Dont ask me to explain.<br /><br />Its a riddle and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly miffed at not finding the actual treasure Gates wanders around yammering to himself about the meaning of the riddle in this frozen cargo hold while the crew just stands around slack-jawed. I mean come on. Someone should have been a little vocal in their disappointment of coming all the way to the freaking Arctic and not finding anything interesting but they just stand there as Gates enters his own world solving the riddle.<br /><br />The next clue turns out to be on the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is appalled. Various characters deliver gratingly obvious exposition (get used to it). All this leads to Ians lackey pulling a gun on Gates and the gunpowder going off in a big explosion. (oh thats why they spilled all the gunpowder! Huh!!) Ian and his henchmen make their escape and Gates and Movie Dork Riley walk nine miles in subzero temperatures to an Inuit village in order to stop them.<br /><br />To stop them Gates concludes after trying the FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) Gates and Riley must steal it themselves. Riley then tells Gates in excruciating detail why they can not steal the Declaration because its so protected with metal and laser eyes and high tech security blah blah. Gates then tells Riley that theres an opportunity to steal it from the Preservation Room. Does Riley know what the Preservation Room is Gates asks? A place where they make jams and jellies? I am not kidding; thats the actual line. Bartha doesnt deliver it like a joke either. So Riley does all this research about the Library of Congress and the Archives and water and sewage fercryinoutloud but doesnt know what the Preservation Room is. This pretty much indicates what level this script is on.<br /><br />To make the rest of this short Gates does in fact make off with the D of I in a ridiculous break-in that could only happen in a movie. (I also hate the way they depict computer monitor technology in movies -- full of improbable and impractical graphics and fonts.) Abigail Chase ends up tagging along for conveniences sake and as an obvious love interest angle. At one point the three of them on the run from the law discuss all their plans really loudly in a clothing store surrounded by people.<br /><br />A series of clues and the kidnapping of Gates father played by a dyspeptic Jon Voight leads good guys and bad guys alike to a huge Indiana Jones fun-house located underneath New York City. Odd that the subway builders never found this thing. Gates and Gates Senior lead Ian off on a wild goose chase. Ian believes theyre trapped in a cul-de-sac and leaves them there. However after theyre gone Riley asks how theyre going to get out. Gates...<br /><br />... oh boy ...<br /><br />... presses a button and a door opens. No Im serious. A button like they might have on a vacu-flush lavatory in an office building. Good thing he knew where that was. Anyway after some more knob-twiddling they find this immense treasure room (remember this is all underneath Manhattan!) full of all sorts of historyish golden things. Riley gets to deliver a really stupid line. Again. And FBI officer Harvey Keitel forgives them arrests Sean Bean and allows the two chemistry-less leads to get married.<br /><br />For any viewer I think it would be hard to ignore all the exposition the leaps of logic and the stereotyped characters for very long. Though some of its exposition involves nice history lessons inserted into conversation at random moments. Id like more conversations like that in my life.',neg
'I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen.<br /><br />Even if you ignore the dodgy accents low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it. I only went to see it as I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film.<br /><br />The simple answer is - they didnt. Characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative. Even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches its climax you dont care what happens to any of them.<br /><br />I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from. But after my friends and I came out of the cinema I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened.<br /><br />They even change the true meaning of the books title Rancid Aluminium by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title.<br /><br />A real mess of a film from start to finish.',neg
'The premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now. Weve all heard or read about it in some kind of con-text. What would you do if you were all alone in the world? What would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes? In fact the last part is actually what happens to Dave and Andrew two room-mates living in a run-down house in the middle of a freeway system. Andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and Dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society. That alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed. Just until...<br /><br />Straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them. Both of them get involved with crime Andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesnt dare going out of the house. Dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues dont treat him very well and with the respect he deserves. The amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it. This is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away... And of course that is exactly what happens.<br /><br />The rest of the story places Dave and Andrew in this world of nothingness. At first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left.<br /><br />Nothing features an incredibly small cast - in fact besides the first couple of shots from the film we only see Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) in the entire film. It is clear that in order to pull this off the cast has to be more than up for the task because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way. Vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close-up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well. Director of Photography Derek Rogers also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it but we dont see it right away.<br /><br />Obviously this cant be an event driven film and its not. Much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void. And thats where some of the most hilarious scenes take place especially in the case of when Andrew discovers a candy bar.<br /><br />Now one could be thinking: How does nothing look like? Well it looks like nothing indeed. The entire world of nothing is white... white no matter in what direction you look. This is the weakness of this film... After an hour or less its getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure its more interesting to look at. Thank God there are some. For example at times when the two lads due to the properties of nothing are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of... tofu (as Andrew claims). Its fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society.<br /><br />One of the best parts of the film is the set... Production designer Jasna Stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this. All in all the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching...<br /><br />However the very best part of the film is the acting. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like the professional actors they both are. The camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said there are just about no props in the film they are really on a bare stage. With plenty of character development and some decent one-liners clever dialogue (at times hilariously stupid) it all works to that end - and this really moves the movie away from the low-budget area to well-crafted handwork.<br /><br />Lets talk a little about the visual effects because they are definitely worth mentioning. Nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film. Theres a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film and although The Drews have milked that scene completely its still fun to watch. One of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment - they have the abilities to wish everything away so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear?<br /><br />Nothing is a bright and well-lit movie it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead (this is in fact one of their theories) but Nothing is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory. We dont know where they are or what has happened to them. We dont know if they will ever get out because the movie ends before we see anything like that. The ending by the way is not as good as it couldve been. Its rather easy to predict what is going to happen still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end its a reasonably satisfactory one.<br /><br />Take Hollow Man Kill Bill Cube Epoch and lots of other films and you have Nothing. It really is an amalgam of different styles still there is no other film (at least that I know of) Nothing is really like. For the people remembering the original Cube Production Commentary on its DVD may remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he came up with the story of Cube. He talks about him and André Bijelic having been room-mates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out Nothing could very well be the screened version of the origin of the Cube story and to that end its almost like one of the Cube prequels.<br /><br />What can I say? I enjoyed Nothing it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well-made with tons of intelligent ideas still I feel the movie is missing something and I have problems finding out precisely what it is... Maybe if we have a Nothing 2 I can answer that question. Nothing is a great film but not as good as I expected it to be.<br /><br />Final rating: 7.5 / 10',pos
'This stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all. James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized Winchester in a shootout only to lose it in a robbery. The story details Stewarts pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film. The rifle changes hands time after time as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence. The picture has plenty of action and suspense as Stewart closes in on his quarry. A great cast supports Stewart here namely Stephen McNally Dan Duryea Millard Mitchell John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson teen heartthrobs in later years have brief but good roles.',pos
'The funniest performance was by Shalom Harlow as Matt Dillons supermodel girlfriend. She was more interesting to me than all the lead actors. This movie got it all wrong; even the most dependable actress of the century Joan Cusask was not able to rise about the ridiculousness of the plot. I did enjoy hearing Macho Man by the Village People over the closing credits. The rest of the movie might have been tolerable if it were to rise to that level of energy.',pos
'I have seen nearly all the films of Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films as well. Compared to these other films this is a rather average to poor film. The plot features two warring brothers--neither one of which I cared much for--and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who. The music and cinematography is pretty good but the special effects at times are terrible--rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play! On top of these complaints the ending of the movie completely DESTROYS and UNDERMINES the entire picture. It turns out that the end isnt true but was completely fudged. Whats the point of this then? If you HAVE seen this film understand that there are MANY better films out there so dont give up!',neg

'I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo. The characters were all very well planned out and all added their own little quirks to the movie. I highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!',pos
'This film Blade Master may be cheap clumsy in appearance and it is sometimes but it shares thoughts on problems that are way beyond the era this film is set in. Ator is the chosen one that has to protect the earth against a terrible weapon that is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon. He goes through obstacles as a witful character who is just more than muscle power although he has quite is lot. I would say this aspect of the movie makes it surpass a film like Conan the barbarian which is the least I can say quite brainless. It doesnt diminish in any ways the great adventure movie that is Conan but it gives Ator his wholesomeness that he shares not with the barbarian. For a lower budget movie this film does good in terms of setting and the fights are most of the time believable. Zor the villain has with is prisoner throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontation that gives tension to the movie even if Ator seems way too fit for the task to loose. <br /><br />What gives this movie that little extra are those scenes that may look quirky but worth of mention. The fight with the serpent god even though he is a gigantic puppet is well handled as the snake with good lightnings remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. The movie climaxes in a most unusual way quite anachronic but breathtaking : the deltaplane sequence. The scene itself is not introduced properly read not at all where did Ator get that machine its pretty unconvincing but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful midair sequence that standalone is the culminating point in the movie elevating Ator in a place where few human fantasy heroes have been. <br /><br />If Blade Master is not among the great fantastic movies of all time is no surprise due to its lacks its a bigger surprise considering the philosophical way it chooses on the confrontation between good and evil the truth it speaks and the heart it shows that this movie is so unwlecomed. I suggest it for every fan of the genre and try take it seriously as an intelligent movie thats to be taken more seriously than it seems.',pos
'The dreams of Karim Hussain are to be feared. When the right hemisphere of his characters overpowers the left shocking images of blood dismemberment and various abominations are released. Religion wont save you nor will mother nature or your own family. Hussains dark poetry because thats what this film really is destabalizes all institutions of sanctuary.<br /><br />`Subconcious Cruelty is a current crowd pleaser on the horrorantasy festival circuit. The films opening meditation on madness is both well written and profound. The protagonists desire to profane the birthing process which brought him into the hell he inhabits unfolds with horrific and credible illogic. From here the film continues deeper into the subconcious and tackles mother nature. Hussain offers depictions of lusty pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness. Nature is exposed as blood-drenched and violent in Hussains frightening enlightenment.<br /><br />`Subconcious Cruelty is disturbing to all and rewarding to those who see past the shock into the mature themes of life lust and madness this very worthy film explores. CJ Goldman deserves kudos for his special make-up as do David Kristian for unnerving sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for score.',pos
'Theodore Rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture civilization and artistic expression!! In this compelling intellectual masterpiece Jonathan R. Betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century such as Francis Ford Copola Martin Scorcese Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking and make any work by Spielberg look trite and elementary. At the time of its release Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film-making to levels never anticipated by film makers. The concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur but adapting an action packed thrilling detective novel co-staring a talking dinosaur with a post-modern name such as Theodore and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it. The world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty. Watching Theodore Rex is much akin to looking into the face of God and hearing Him say you are my most beloved creation. This is one of the few films that is simply TO DIE FOR!!!',pos
'This is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen. I saw it at the premiere at SXSW and was extremely disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even said as much at the premiere. This is a drama but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was. Thats never a good sign. The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Liviens roommates/bandmates. They were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously. The cheesy dropping of Beatles lyrics was just absurd. The soundtrack was excellent however and was probably the best part of the movie. Unless youre one of those crazy rabid Dominic Monaghan fans dont bother with this one.',neg
'I was expecting a lot better from the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring prequel to the main series. After the first 30 minutes I was waiting for it to end. The characters do a lot of talking about religion computers programming retribution etc... There are gangsters mafia types who carry out hits. However Caprica doesnt have the action of the original series to offset the slower parts.<br /><br />Let me give you some helpful advice when viewing movies: As a general rule if there is a lot of excessive exploitive titillation then you know the movie will be a dud. Caprica has lots of this. The director/writer usually attempts to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing in a few naked bodies. It never works and all it does is demean the (very) young actresses involved and I feel sorry for them. Directors/writers who do this should be banned from the business.<br /><br />If you want to be bored for an hour and a half by all means rent Caprica. Theres (free) porn on the Net if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise move along nothing to see here.',neg
'The wife of a stage producer in London hopes to fix up the American song-and-dance man starring in her husbands latest show with an acquaintance an American girl who makes her living modeling fashions in society circles. Unfortunately the couple has already met on their own with the girl thinking the guy is actually the show producer married to her friend (the fact hes not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstandings!). Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical is eventually dragged back down to the earth by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scotts idiotic script which is full of juvenile behavior. Astaire and Rogers dont just meet cute--they meet ridiculously (hes tap-dancing like a madman in the hotel suite above hers and she complains). Audiences of 1935 probably didnt care how these two were going to get together--as long as they did so and happily. Seen today the central characters appear to have no motivation to end up in each others arms: he plies her with flowers (after telling his friend he wants to remain fancy free in the love department) and she gives him the brush-off. Nothing that a little dancing couldnt cure! This glamorous twosome are as deliberately unreal as are the London and Venice settings but we watch simply because the leads are Fred and Ginger. Its a fantasy for have-nots...ones who dont mind the dumbed-down plot. The musical moments do break up the monotony of the contrived scenario yet fail to transcend the surrounding silliness. ** from ****',neg
'I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Luckily for me no one knows it because I didnt make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theaters I was glad! My agents were driven nuts by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. They later told me that once back in California (we shot in Atlanta) these professionals had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! Even edited down to 90 minutes its at least twice as long as it needs to be. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming but otherwise -- what a waste of film!',neg
'This is one of the rare movies that I did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it. This wasnt because it had particularly entranced or impressed me. The contrary it had given me nothing at all.<br /><br />Why? Because somehow everything was so much overdone that I couldnt take this film seriously anymore. There was so much sex and violence that I got the strong impression that the film was trying very very hard to be offensive as if it was aiming at superlatives in ugliness rather than in telling a convincing tale about two women caught in a spiral of crime.<br /><br />Baise-moi had been described as Thelma & Louise with actual sex to me. Well it is true that the main idea is similar. There are two women traveling through the country because theyve committed crimes and know that their lives are finished now that the police are going to catch them and they decide that now that everythings over anyway there is no way to hold back.<br /><br />Baise-moi had been described as a feminist film where women who had suffered from male dominance in the past exact revenge upon the men that they encounter.<br /><br />This is something that I had never interpreted into this film simply because none of these women had ever been innocent and because they do not just kill irresponsible violent men but also men that they seduce themselves men that show the sense of wanting to do protected sex. And they kill women. No they are in no way better than the characters that they encounter and murder in hideous brutal ways.<br /><br />How easily the heroines decide to murder and how much pleasure they take in it made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way or even take them seriously. It was just all too much. Too much sex too much violence. I got the feeling that sex and violence were only there in order to create a superlative in ugliness rather than in conveying a story or making a point.<br /><br />Baise-moi left me with no impression hadnt set me thinking because it was so far removed from any real world. So constructed unrealistic and over the top.<br /><br />There was nothing that I could do with this film there was simply nothing about it to think about other than Why did they make this terrible film? Had the intense unpleasantness going on in this film served a purpose Id easily accepted it. But since I found nothing since the films story appeared to be not more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one film... I filed it away under unnecessary torture decided to never ever EVER watch this film again and I now consider this to be the worst film Ive ever seen. <br /><br />Worst not just because it really isnt my cup of tea to watch people get raped rape have sex in other forms and kill one another... but because whatever it was that the makers wanted to tell the world with their film... if they wanted to say anything at all... it just didnt work. And theres nothing else that could save this film because its also filmed in such an ugly style.',neg

Its one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks at PI.<br /><br />At some later date I got to actually see it in a theater.

'The unthinkable has happened. Having first witnessed it a few years ago I have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called McCinseys Island. A family adventure movie with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (Im not making this up) it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film Ive seen that made me wonder what else the films budget could have been spent on. Like new schools or cancer-treating drugs. However for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump Guest House Paradiso to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies Ive ever had to watch.<br /><br />Based loosely around the puerile but amusing TV show Bottom this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action. His buddy Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together they try to run Britains worst hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. Between them they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. The plot such as it is involves the arrival of fabled Italian screen goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the Guest House Paradiso much to the astonishment of Richie and Eddie. And... thats it.<br /><br />I used to think that the Carry On films represented everything bad about the UK film industry and God knows weve spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy. Weve had films like Trainspotting 28 Days Later Four Weddings And A Funeral and the brilliant Shaun Of The Dead (also starring Simon Pegg) but this... this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of Sid James and Barbara Windsors top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. Guest House Paradiso is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it. I kept watching waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came. Just an endless stream of trapped knob gags unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk. Come the first ad break (it was on TV you see) and I was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you my readers kept me going. Im watching this so they dont have to became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force-fed dog food.<br /><br />Trust me I used to love the Bottom TV show. The combination of suitably grubby acting from Mayall and Edmondson with OTT juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. Certainly not for an hour and a half as Edmondson and Mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. Honestly this makes Mayalls Drop Dead Fred seem like The Godfather and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie) feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region. Theyd probably enjoy it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so lucky. The movie equivalent of Chernobyl and should be avoided as such.',neg
'This program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy I cant get it out of my head.

Some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our PC world wed never be able to do it in real life. I always learn something from the shows.

'Homicide: The Movie proved to be a good wrap-up to a well-written well-directed and well-acted series. Loose ends were tied up that werent properly addressed at the end of the final season. The entire series and especially the movie provided a life-like look at life (and death) in Baltimore a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. My attraction to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore but once I experienced life here for myself I realized how realistic it was. And the movie certainly retained that spirit. I will certainly miss new original episodes of the series but am very grateful to NBC and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of Charm City.',pos
'Dont be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story on this seems rather interesting with speculative hints.

At first I thought it was going to be a Kung Fu movie so I started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and I had to finish it.<br /><br />The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble. She was such a great actor for being so little. Maybe the fact it was in Chinese so the English was dubbed made it harder for me to tell...but she really seemed to be in character perfectly. I felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten. lol. Even when she brings him another grandson just so he can pass on his art...it turns out that kid was kidnapped so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live. lol...whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa just backfires.<br /><br />In the end he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks...which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie.<br /><br />Definitely a gem and totally original.<br /><br />Scott',pos
'I saw this movie in the middle of the night when I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch. Its one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just cant turn it off no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad its good and so bad its well just plain BAD its worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that its both! Great middle-of-the-night fare if only for the fabulous tennis drag. Dont even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that Chad Lowe is so obviously male because logic does not apply.',neg
'This remarkable film can be summed up very easily. First of all while the comparisons to Princess Bride are inevitable its almost futile to do so. While both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop Stardust is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film Ive ever seen. Its such a hybrid of those genres but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances special effects cinematography and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. Thirdly I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way. In fact the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch. Wonderfully casted and superbly acted across the board. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one Ive seen since Return of the King (not that I am comparing the two at all). OK so its not that easy to sum up but dont let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the films pathetic PR prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!',pos
'This is one of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments. Theres the usual blond vamp dancer (what is up with Serlings fondness for that kind of character such that she keeps showing up in various episodes?) and other assorted characters but its Jack Elams old man who totally steals the show. I consider this the funny light-hearted version of The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street -- or perhaps a 20-minute Twilight Zone parody of The Thing. On another note: I thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually went on to other things -- he looked familiar -- but it seems that Ron Kipling disappeared after just two TV credits to his name.',pos

'Back when musicals werent showcases for choreographers we had wonderful movies such as this one.<br /><br />Being a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire I was delighted to finally see this movie. Not quite a blend of Wodehouse and Hollywood but close enough. Some of the American vaudeville humour the slapstick not the witty banter clash with Wodehouses British sense of humour. But on the whole the American style banter makes the American characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures.<br /><br />Some inventive staging for the dance numbers including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors more than make up for the lack of a Busby Berkley over the top dance number. They seem a lot more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic.<br /><br />The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore dont hurt the movie instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge. Its also nice not to have a wise cracking headstrong love interest. Instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest far more in keeping with Wodehouses young aristocratic females.',pos
'How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy I never did see the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake that was made with humans the cartoon was just perfect enough whats the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean hes a great comedic actor but him as the Grinch? It just didnt make any sense to me. His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over done and wasnt needed. They actually just destroyed the story period.<br /><br />All the whos in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that hes not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other whos. He kicks her out and decides that he doesnt want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show the whos what his version of Christmas is all about. But soon he realizes that the whos may know that its a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas.<br /><br />How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasnt needed and was a bit over the top. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version at least in my opinion. The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas.<br /><br />1/10',neg

Other than Olivier the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories; whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper.<br /><br />Im going to go watch it right now (again my... 11th time).',pos
'Forgive me but this work of director Peter Hall is horrendous. If you cant get to us with the plot why not kill someones cat or dog. That surely reaches the audiences. This viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie. And believe me I saw it coming before she opened the package. How predictable can you get. Take a cute animal then kill it in a gruesome way. I have never been a fan of De Mornay and this performance tells me why. Overacted and somewhat stagnant in interpretation I found her rather silly and definitely boring. I did like Banderas but felt bad that he had to play opposite De Mornay. He has done much better in other films namely Philadelphia where he had some honesty in his dialogue. In this chestnut he did his best to keep his character real. But the writers Green & Rush did a good job in preventing this with their trite storyline and insipid dialogue. Please let us not be subjected to this kind of entertainment. Some of us arent fooled by corny plots bludgeoning animals and generally long winded dialogue. Seeing her get away with it made me furious.',neg
'From the acting direction scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims.

'A crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) who is desperately urged by two FBI agents Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use her therapy on Carl Stargher (Vincent DOfornio) a serial killer who (uses strange and horrifying torture tactics) is found in a coma by the feds. What Novak wants in return from Deane is whereabouts of Starghers latest victim is and if shes alive. Once Deane gets into Starghers mind which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of David Lynchs Dune or Blue Velvet and Wes Cravens A Nightmare on Elm Street the adventure begins. Deane sees a variety of odd people ranging from Carl as a youngster (an adorable Jake Thomas) to a Freddy Krueger-like man minus the razor claws. I dont want to give away the ending but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances Howard Shores creepy musical score and directing (by Tarsem who shows here that he can direct).',pos

'Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the New Yorks longest- established floating craps game and he needs $1000 to secure a new location. Confident of his odds he bets the citys highest-roller Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that he cant woo uptight missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). Guys and Dolls (1955) is such a great musical because it deftly blends the contrasting styles of film and stage. During a dazzling opening sequence crowds of pedestrians move in rhythm stopping and starting as though responding to backstage cues. Even the walking movements themselves are stylised and angular halfway between a walk and a dance. Mankiewiczs New York City is a glittering flurry of art deco colour and movement a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal thuggery seems perfectly genial. <br /><br />As I write this review Ive just received word that Jean Simmons has passed away age 80. This unbelievably was the first time Id seen her in a film yet she dazzled me from the beginning. Her idealistic and sexually-repressed Sarah comes out of her shell following an alcohol binge in Havana letting loose with an adorably playful rendition of If I Were A Bell. Even though both Simmons and Brando were non-singers producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to dub their vocals contending that maybe you dont sound so good but at least its you. Despite Goldwyns backhanded confidence the pair both do well to carry entire musical numbers themselves. Simmons suggests the same child-like liveliness that Audrey Hepburn might have brought to the role and Brando exudes such self-assurance and charisma that it doesnt matter that his singing voice isnt quite there.',pos
'This movie was a waste of the celluloid it was printed on. It is a disastrous scene much like a particularly gruesome train wreck.<br /><br />Watching this is like trying to explain the meaning of life. The main plot point is that the character played by Steve Guttenberg is a party animal whos not supposed to gamble because that would violate his parole. The kids he befriends refuse to play with him as coach for a while because he gambles. BUT... a few minutes later after theyve won the championship a large sum of money saves their shelter. And where did they get the money? GAMBLING!!! Add this to the creepy scenes at the funeral home (why exactly are there BEDROOMS in a funeral home?) and the useless peripheral character',neg
'Yumiko (Wakana Sakai) the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased Japanese businessman inherits control of her fathers company; her uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata) miffed that he wasnt left the business to run orders a hit on his niece. When jug-eared chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks out hit-man Invincible (Jung Yuen) he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill Yumiko. Instead he falls for the pretty heiress and ends up vowing to protect her. However she is kidnapped by Kazuos men while Kensuke is preoccupied playing an arcade game with cop Daniel (Sam Lee).<br /><br />Uncle Kazuo keeps Yumiko in a hypnotic trance and takes control of the business but runs into a spot of bother himself when his gangster pals threaten to reveal his illegal activities unless he allows them total control.<br /><br />Meanwhile Kensuke teams up with two martial arts experts Lam Kau (Yuen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo) who are hunting Invincible. He learns Kung Fu and attempts to free Yumiko.<br /><br />A mixture of broad slapstick humour spoofery and fight scenes No Problem 2 is a disappointing film considering the talent involved: 80s kung fu superstar Yuen Baio manages a few fight scenes but is getting a little old for acrobatics these days; director Kar Lok Chin delivers the kind of dumb parody schtick Id expect from a Scary Movie film; Jung Yuen resorts to mocking his character in Operation Scorpio; and Sam Lee well Sam Lee is as annoying as always!<br /><br />On the other hand Collin Chou as gangster Ben impressed me; he has an obviously strong screen presence which has not gone unnoticed by Hollywoodhe has since starred in two of the Matrix movies and is soon to appear in D.O.A. directed by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed by Wakana Sakai but for an entirely different reason: this beauty is easy on the eye and should go much further in the film business.<br /><br />There is some fun to be had from working out what movies are being parodied but at 104 minutes I found this film a real chore to sit through. If people pulling funny faces accompanied by silly sound effects makes you burst your sides laughing then No Problem 2 might appeal to you. Otherwise I would leave well alone.',neg
'A clever script from the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and smart performances from the two male leads - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or should it be the other way around) result in an engaging and entertaining thriller.<br /><br />Add to the above the competent direction from veteran JEAN HERMAN and a sparse but effective score by FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX it becomes easy why this film has an odd timeless quality.<br /><br />This is a buddy buddy or bonding story with two loners both disillusioned and world weary returning presumably from Algiers. Like the other colonial powers of this time (post WW II leading into the 60s) France had struggled to keep up appearances overseas. Losing Algiers was a bitter blow.<br /><br />ADIEU LAMI (the original title) chronicles the actions of our two (anti) heroes as they struggle to make a go of it after their discharge.<br /><br />One thing happens after another and the viewer really has to pay attention because JAPRISOT is lean and economical with his script: if it is there then there must be a reason.<br /><br />Suffice to say these two men battle it out physically and psychologically one long weekend. Their motivation is quite different their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on each other. That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are outwardly so different - the former arguably a pretty boy and the latter an ugly thug adds to the chemistry.<br /><br />That quest makes for a great story which in turn makes for a great film.<br /><br />Lest I forget there are women in this film and true to the Japrisot method they too are memorable though not nearly as fleshed out; to say much more would be to spoil ones delight in discovering their true nature.<br /><br />FAREWELL FRIEND HAS BEEN RELEASED IN THE UK; AN ANAMORPHIC IMAGE 16.9 ENHANCED; IN English ONLY (not even subtitles for the hard of hearing); A RUNNING TIME OF 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK but the DE ROUBAIX music has lots of punch! <br /><br />Highly recommended.',pos

While an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive (at best) special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years) Severed ranks among the worst Ive ever seen. Im never sure who the protagonists are all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen in the dance floor murder scene.

'This is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama. My all-time favourite actor Robert Culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime and homicidal psychosis. The teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of Dragnet look evenhanded by comparison. But what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie building the fear and paranoia by degrees as well as the feel of the whole California setting. The cars are really great as well as I recall. I give this film a 10 and I defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute. Remember just because its made-for-television doesnt mean it isnt great art.',pos
'Okay if youve seen The Ring youve basically seen The Grudge. Its trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds but it fails miserably. The plot if you can call it that is weak and rather full of holes for instance how would the care center have known that Yoko didnt show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there? And its not really clear what Bill Pullmans character had to do with anything. He just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot. It didnt make a lot of sense what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room the little boy or the dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it more.',neg
'This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. Id recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord! It approaches the idea of the afterlife in a contemporary way - without cheaply capitalizing on all the gohst and supernatural themes that have become staples in Hollywood and the TV networks.',pos

'Directed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People Out of the Past Night of the Demon) and written by Phillip Dunne (How Green was My Valley) Anne of the Indies is a quite interesting adventure pirate movie. Its main character of captain Anne Providence is based on a real woman-pirate Anne Boney who actually lived and sailed through 18th centurys Atlantic.<br /><br />The film begins with the sea battle where Annes (Jean Peters) pirate ship attacks a trade ship that was on its way to Europe from the South America. As a result a treasure of great value is captured along with a handsome French officer Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan) who is taken prisoner. Anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocated but its only till she sets him free when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife Molly (Debra Paget) with whom he pretty much in love with. Anne begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead. The pirate movie cliché figure of `Black Beard also makes his appearance here this time played by Thomas Gomez.<br /><br />Though Anne of the Indies probably appears to be no more nor less than a revisiting of pirate movie clichés it still has its classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in Technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story and most of all in personal touches in directing of all of it by Jacques Tourneur. 7/10',pos

She finds Tarzan and Jane who try to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially villainous High Priest but isnt used to his full advantage.

'Princess Tam Tam is without the trappings of racism in the way we think of racism in the United States but there are more subtle (to the American viewer) assertions about ethnic identity during the time. Pay attention to Alwinas (Baker) placement within shots how she is addressed by the other characters the settings around her that all depict her as a savage African and ask yourself if Alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film. I dont want to ruin anything but at the end pay very careful attention the dichotomy between Eastern and Western culture is to say the least offensive such diction is thankfully disavowed these days. The French have a checkered past as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted (see Chris Markers Les Statues Meurent Aussi- 1953) and pay attention to the places the European travelers visit while they are in Africa and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the other. I give this film a 7 because I am a sucker for Baker much of what she did in her professional career like Princes Tam Tam that is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration her work as a freaking spy (I am gushing sorry.) However the film for me is captivating because of her performance besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities.',pos
'Welcome to Collinwood is a lot of things but it is none of the following:<br /><br />A George Clooney star vehicle Unfunny Un-Original<br /><br />And yes i know the basis for the movie is another movie.

This film went under the radar after not grossing much at the box office and isnt even a cult classic.

'Well I saw this movie yesterday and its - unfortunately - worse than you could think. First of all the plot is idiotic it has no sense at all. The screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues. The audience was laughing many times. And the suspense is very low. Actors play so-so with an exception of Sharon Stone who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like I want to *beep* you  and it looks like lets say it gently a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all. That erotic tension from BI1 is totally gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to DVD but on a far lower lever than the original movie. For instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. The script is done by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas. Theres no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and badly edited at times. Im sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was: Why heavent they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie? All to all the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in the popular cinema. It was provoking sexy and controversial. It had the best Sharon Stones performance in her career. It had this specific Paul Verhoevens style. Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie badly directed and a sure Razzie Award Winner in many categories. Its a pity that they made this film.',neg

'A thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine and here Susan Lucci performs as a siren although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one. Isabelle (Lucci) inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John OHurley) begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff) simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for Richard apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent. When Davis becomes convinced that guileful Isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent Stewart. In the wake of the hit-mans assault upon Collins a pair of police detectives performed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott become increasingly curious concerning Isabelles possible involvement in the crime while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured Richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamoratas maneuvering. Lucci and Kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds but OHurley and McDermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements. Released upon a Fremantle DVD this largely lustreless affair depicting a man neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top-flight visual and sound quality and although no extra features are provided the above-average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.',neg
'RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER in my opinion is an excellent masterpiece. I felt all warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. To me she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. However I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. In addition I thought that Lurky (voiec of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voiec of Peter Cullen) were diabolical. Before I wrap this up Id like to say that everyone was perfectly cast the direction was flawless and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who hasnt seen it especially die-hard fans of the TV series. I guarantee you youll enjoy it.',pos

'Though Im not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting I get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty. The great tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist. Cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasingly off the wall as the Taoist monk who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number. Perhaps best off all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive. The film takes in elements of fantasy horror comedy and romance all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills and fills the film with mists shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere. Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters with if Im not mistaken Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times a marvellous touch. Though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times this is a beautiful piece of entertainment with swell characters and plotting even the odd neat character arc a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere. An ethereal treasure highly recommended.',pos

Dan Schneider probably went through about 5 minutes of studying teenage interests because all I see is him saying iPod? iPhone? iHome? Aha!

No. We want you to turn it up to 60 pickles! Not only that but if you look closely nearly all the sets in the shows were used in Drake and Josh and Neds Declassified that were simply spit-and-polished with random stuff to try and make it look different.<br /><br />The scenes where the show is showing a broadcast of the iCarly network is just as terrible as the entire series itself. The dialogue in them is atrociously bad which may be accepted by some since it IS just two friends playing around in front of a camera but whats the deal with the really odd humorless antics they do like Random Dancing!? And it just gets worse from there.<br /><br />In terms of acting Miranda and Jennette arent at their best by far. Nathan Kress who played Freddie isnt believable at times but he does an okay job. The person who really steals the show is the humorous prowess of Jerry Trainor who fits in his protective older brother role very well and his wide-eyed loud-mouthed acting can make for some pretty funny segments. Too bad they arent frequent because that might have given the show an extra star in my opinion.<br /><br />Dan Schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving Miranda Cosgrove her own cable-born playground to hop around and spew unfunny jokes and pathetic cue-card lines in every direction because everyone else has exceptional talent buried underneath the poorly-done script and weightless acting. Dan Schneider did a great job with Drake and Josh so its a real disappointment that iCarly is such a failure. Jerry Trainors acting saved this show from a 1 out of 10 rating but he alone cant save iCarly from being as horrible as it is.',neg
'I saw Peter Watkins Culloden and The War Game a few months before this and was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same or at least very similar in this film detailing on the one hand a trial of dissidents in California in the (apparently) near future and on the other the attempts of a group of convicted criminals to slog through 50 miles of desert to win their freedom in a government-run punishment park as an alternative to prison. Watkins films everything in a documentary style which causes for more than a little awkwardness or required strong suspension of disbelief: how is it that the camera crew is with the group of starving and parched prisoners over 2 days without either offering help or sharing in their misery? And thats merely the most obvious example. But questionable storytelling aside this packs a punch; no question you have to be interested in political film-making to really get involved but the film really isnt like anything else of its era: it pulls no punches offers no simple solutions. The leftist political figures are certainly painted broadly at times but they arent all alike; the right-wing government functionaries seem a little more cartoonish but even they are allowed to show at least a little humanity. Overall the film gives much to think about and leaves an indelible taste.....8/10 DVD rental',pos
'Picture this. Someone makes a film about the Columbine or Virginia tech massacre only the film is directed by the guy who did home alone (i know this isnt but bare with me) and stars Sean Astin off of Goonies!! picture the terrorists being overpowered by buckets of water on top of ajar doors and marbles and this is why you need to see the film. unfortunately it doesnt go all the way by actually having the skateboard lying on the floor for the evil Mexicans to trip on but its halfway there you have to give it above 7 for that but not a 9 because it didnt go crazy enough. Pity its seemed like it would be comical cheesiness well worth a cult status',pos

'The summer of 1979 when this flick was a staple on that new movie medium called HBO was Gas Line Summer & Iranian Hostage Crisis Summer. A change of mood was about to end low-budget loner-on-a-mission car films although Smokey & the Bandit kept need-for-speed flicks going as live-action Roadrunner cartoons for a few more years. Corvette Summer is as quirky as any earlier movie like Vanishing Point or Dirty Mary Crazy Larry if lighter & sexier than most. Just-graduated high-school automotive genius Kenneth (Hamill) hitchhikes to Vegas in pursuit of the car theft ring that ripped off his Shop Class masterpiece a super-custom right-hand-drive Vette. In the spiritual limbo of the I-15 desert (see Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas) he gets into a custom van (yes this was the tail end of the van craze too) tricked out as a mobile bordello & driven by sassy aspiring hooker Vanessa (Potts) on her way to Sin City to make her well whatever it is ambitious hookers make. VANessa get it? Shy innocent Kenneth is in way over his head in Vegas with only his all-American resolve & his new friend to help him although the hard-edged young call girl is predictably less world-wise than she first seems. Why in the I am Woman age Vanessa invested her talents money & future in the worlds oldest but least dignified profession over say college or even hairdressing can be explained by young men whod like to think that all women at least consider the joys of that career path. Remember the target audience right? Hamill is a good choice for the whitebread Kenneth (the car doesnt even belong to him personally but to his school) who wont be deterred from his goal by violence money or even love--until he finds out why the car was really stolen. Potts acts with style & energy but Vanessa is too incredible for any but the most credulous testosterone machine to buy into. The bad guys are made surprisingly human especially by the always-fine Brion James. But theres not much action & this isnt the kind of movie that can be carried by dialog plot twists or Heavy Themes. You could always reach up turn the TV dial & plug in your Pong console. The similar but meaner Chris Mitchum vehicle Stingray which appeared at about the same time featured lamer acting but more skin speed & mayhem. The best features of each film might have produced a Vette movie worth remembering. Thus the Trans Am was left to rule the box-office muscle car showroom. Another forgotten car movie brought back from the dead by Speed Channels fine weekend series Lost Drive-in.',neg
'Make no mistake about High School Bigshot is a bad movie.<br /><br />High School Bigshot is about a geek who makes a plan to become rich and get the girl. However he goes about it all wrong and of course by the end of the movie ends up dead along with a few other people thankfully including the girl.<br /><br />The moral of the story is all women care about is wealth. Also for us men I guess were just supposed to accept we either have it or we dont have it! <br /><br />I could easily see how this movie could be rated a 1 however it is above that of the very worst of movies. The actings not totally horrible and production values arent ultra-terrible. Over all its a bad movie and not worth viewing for many reasons. If you insist of course at torturing yourself watch the MST version. <br /><br />2/10 (maybe a 1.5/10)',neg

'This film is awful. The CGI is the very cheap gray blob CGI. The crocodile looks like a large gray smudge. The worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive. It is mostly a photo-shopped CGI that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the CGI smudge across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever witnessed and I have seen lots of the very bad Sci-Fi Channel movies.<br /><br />Aside from the terrible lack of special effects the cast is composed of the typical low-cost actors who probably work as Waiters/Waitresses at local diners while they wait for their Big Breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the Villains Headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off Kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building (and crushing Kate) the Croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water. No laws of Physics can apply to this movie or the special effects. At least there is honor among crocodiles.',neg
'Lost 24 Carnivale Desperate Housewifes...the list goes on and on. These and a bunch of other high-quality shows proves that were in the middle of a golden age in television history. Lost is pure genius. Incredible layers of personal and psychologically viable stories underscored by sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word when describing a TV-show) a killer score great performances and editing. Anyone who isnt hooked on this are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever. It may have its problems when watching only one episode a week but the DVD format is actually an incredible way to watch this. Hope they keep it up (as Im sure they do).',pos
'I think the problem with some reactions to this film is that - with few exceptions - they dont focus on the main disconnect hence the main split in the audience.<br /><br />On the one side there are those who are taken by the visual design pretty costumes and variety of elements going into the film. Some childrens movie fans love the colour and animation and all the un-scary magical effects shapeshifting animals and so on. Some culture vultures like the complicated references the layerings of different folklore elements and the fact that they can watch Zhang Ziyi singing and quasi-miming in two different languages in what really was intended to be a childrens comedy.<br /><br />On the other side there are those who say that a childrens movie should still have a point that a blend of folktales is not a tale at all and that its easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone into the technical aspects to make it seem real.<br /><br />In other words the ideas could be lovely; but when you put them onstage they have to deliver. Here they dont.<br /><br />A good folktale - from any country - has a clear story a point and characters who interact strongly with each other. This lacks them all. A few over-sophisticated gestures to opera Western and Japanese are no replacement for a solid theme.<br /><br />As a fantasy fan I must say that Ive sat through some turkeys and loved a few but this one really tries to do too many things - cheaply. Putting in Zhang Ziyi to try to add a little glitter smacks of exotic flower syndrome. The other problem isnt that theres no plot; theres half a plot which means that you keep getting pulled in then dropped again as another none-too-sharply-executed dance number kicks off.<br /><br />The characters all seem to know that theyre starring in a movie. Unless you really like watching other peoples amateur video this aint good. Id like to test this on real children; I think theyd drop it for Uproar in Heaven after about 20 minutes.',neg
'This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in. This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. I think the reasons that the Naked Gun and the like movies is that they did not require Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny he isnt. The movie had only one good part and this may be considered a spoiler by some and that the beginning credits were animated. If the whole movie had been animated it might have been good. I had no intention of seeing this movie when I saw the ads for it and the only reason I did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. This is the first and probably only movie I have ever walked out on. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a score of -100.',neg

'I saW this film while at Birmingham Southern College in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the Red Balloon. Both films are similar in their dream-like quality. The bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner a little boy is away at school. A cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are and begins to warily stalk his prey. The boy begins his walk home from school and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend. The fish becomes agitated by the cats presence and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly walks over to the fish gently picks him up with his paws and returns him to his bowl. The boy returns happily to his fish none the wiser.<br /><br />The ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity. It is hard to imagine how the director couldve pulled the technical feat back in 1959 -- it seems more a trick for 2003.<br /><br />If you can find it watch it -- you wont be disappointed! And if you *do* find it let me know so I can get a copy too!',pos
'I think it took a lot of guts for her to come forward like that. It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that is what helps people most. But in her case what she did was remarkable. I have been in the mental health field for five years and I think it is great that mental illness is not a terrible word anymore and I believe she helped. I always thought she was great and always will. I am glad that she wrote this book and that the movie was made. She is a remarkable lady and I hope she continues to act. She has been through a lot and has faced it. I would really love to see her work more with children especially child actors. Her ordeal should not have happened and I think she would be wonderful as a mentor to young people. The movie was so moving to me that I was very touched. Suffering a TBI which brought the onset of my disorder and having PTSD it is good to know that someone has the courage enough to display her life as she did. I believe it helped this nation and people in general realize that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you Ms. Duke or Anna which ever you prefer.',pos
'Norman Wisdoms final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings  bringing his accident-prone milquetoast up-to-date this being a product of the Swinging Sixties! The end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the stars typical slapstick (and sentimentality) with mild sexuality and even milder satire; the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager Sally Geeson (who doesnt mind getting involved with him but doesnt take their relationship all that seriously either); Sarah Atkinson appears as Geesons friend who warns Norman of her fickle character.<br /><br />The film is nowhere near as bad as Leonard Maltins BOMB rating would have it and if anything is interesting for its treatment of mid-life crisis (being in many ways similar to Hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979]  both of which incidentally Ive only just watched); towards the end Norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking!

'I have seen three other movies that are worse than this one Plan 9 from Outerspace Side Hackers and the dreaded Blair Witch Project There are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just isnt believable.<br /><br />Lets start with an AMTRAK train with no skirts or handrails between cars. The killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the train.<br /><br />In one scene a killer sneaks into a womans apartment. He wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her so what does he do? He turns up her stereo! If I heard my stereo suddenly get louder Id be concerned. He kills the women by throwing an electric hair curler into the tub. I was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cord could be tossed ten feet and remain plugged in. Plus the apartment looked modern enough to have ground fault outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted.<br /><br />The Boeing 747 is one of the most well known commercial airliners on the planet so this part really amazed me. First the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and second it wasnt on the top deck of the plane. I watched in utter amazement as the pilot and co-pilot (Where was the flight engineer?) walked right past the spiral staircase and headed forward towards the nose of the airplane.<br /><br />I was also amazed that bullets wouldnt penetrate an aluminum serving cart (good thing for our hero) or bathroom doors but would penetrate the ceiling causing a fuel leak that exited through a small hole in the fuselage. Huh? Watching three guys lengthen a runway by 100 yards in less than a week was pretty amazing as well.<br /><br />I didnt check was this a movie of the week or something? It was terrible.',neg
'This is not a very good movie but its not a stinker either. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk.<br /><br />My GF and I have figured this movie out (we think) so here it is:<br /><br />***MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW***<br /><br />Firstly this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious-dream-state junk (95\% of the movie.)<br /><br />Ignoring the junk what REALLY happened is this: A group of school friends go to a rave one night. They leave and get into a car accident where everyone but Cassie and Sean die. Thats the simple cut down version. (Thats right I said Sean bear with me)<br /><br />Right after the accident Cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life & death right up until the very end of the movie. This is where the dream part starts.<br /><br />The movie is called SOUL Survivors right? Cassies mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls (Annie Matt Raven the 2 weirdos and Jude) along with images conjured up by her mind (Sean school and everything else around her). The souls continue doing what they were defined as: Annie the rave-going chick the 2 weirdo-killers (from opening scene) Father Jude still helping people etc.<br /><br />We are then taken on a very long ride shown lots of images (many of which my GF and I still cant tie in) but it all boils down to it not being Cassies time to die.<br /><br />At the end Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being dead for a while. Her family and Sean are there. This is reality again. Shes OK.<br /><br />Then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled. But this part is really just a nightmare and she wakes up beside Sean obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience.<br /><br />Due to space restrictions we didnt cover every little thing but feel free to drop us an e-mail if you want to.<br /><br />',neg
'From very long we are seeing movies on Gandhi. And mostly the light is always on portrayal of Gandhi as freedom fighter or man with principles. But when I heard that a movie is being made which will highlight Gandhi as Father and stress on his relationship with his Son it instantly hit my attention as this is one territory which is least being explored as it has his own dark side and less people shown courage to dwell into it. Fortunetly Anil Kapoor (Producer) and Feroz Abbad Khan (Director) did.<br /><br />The story start with Gandhi working in South Africa and his relationship with white people and his wife. Latter Akshay (Harilal) joined his father for becoming a barrister but his dream took overturn when his father (Gandhi) pushed (Or motivate) him to become freedom fighter. It showcase that Gandhi believes more on practical study rather then formal education. Harilal too try to walk on his father footstep but soon failed as its infatuation towards his wife children and his own dream of becoming big success altered his path and then start the repulsion between son and father. He finally defeated his father in terms of pursuing his dream and to left him on his own terms. He written back to India but then start his unsuccessful stories which become bigger and bigger with time. I am leaving reader to see movie to catch further story...<br /><br />Performance. First Akshay. He has given best performance of his tenure so far and is absolutely convincing in his portrayal as Harilal Gandhi. The scene in which he reach the room where his wife dead body is placed is one where you can see a fine actor which is hidden/developing in Akshay. Darshan jariwala is also good as MK Gandhi and able to live up such a larger then life character. He performed well and with quite an ease. Shefali Chaya (Now Shah) as Kasturba is brilliant actress and already proved her metal in TV serials. Bhumika chawla too performed well but actress of her candidature is waste in these kinds of role. Other actor have also justifies their performances.<br /><br />Technique and Make up is also good and cinematography especially that Duo tone color picturisation was too good. Costume looks and match with context.<br /><br />Overall a worth seeing movie which is defiantly slow in progress and impatient people may find it boring but give you an insight of area which is not brought to silver screen till date. Also the way story progress and connection of scene may look worn to some people and to critics especially but for an average movie watcher like me it still enough to make me occupied on my seat till end.',pos
'This one grew on me. I love the R.D. Burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story I found much to be moved by as I kept re-watching the movie. The brother-sister plot line is powerful I thought; theres also more probably obligatory stuff like bar fights a loony crime story etc. that are just distracting. (Though not unfunny from a certain point of view.) Also the English translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch and as loony as it is I am grateful to him for doing it.<br /><br />Like many of the Bollywood movies Ive seen this one is melodramatic and opera-like including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has travelled to Kathmandu seeking to re-connect with this girl grown up and troubled (she had been told her brother and mother were dead) numbing her pain with drugs.<br /><br />A super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement which brought hordes of seekers to India from an Indian point of view that sees them as people driven to India by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies but nonetheless in India living only for the pleasures of the moment. The hippie singing-dancing-drugging scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their tone (Im old enough to remember) and I feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zoned-out kids are actual hippie extras as I remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the East getting this kind of work in Bollywood.<br /><br />(It is not about the actual Hare Krishna movement though the movie hippies sing a Krishna/Rama chant as do a group of actual Indian devotees unrelated to the hippies in the opening scene of the movie.)<br /><br />~Virginia',pos
'Now Ive always been a fan of Full Moons puppet work. But I have to say that Robot Jox is one of there better projects. Yes you heard me. The story works wonderful the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job. Gary Graham who really makes his mark on TV in shows like ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name. The stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better. The color was wrong they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be. But that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the Robot Jox if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies then you will like this movie. 9 STARS OUT OF 10.',pos
'Where do I begin? Walt Disneys happiest motion picture Lady and the Tramp is one of if not possibly my favourite in the theatrical canon of Disney animation. The sequel however is... to say the very least enjoyable. I enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie. It was (flame-shield up!) adorable! The Broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked and I was humming the songs for the rest of the night. I can if you asked me to still sing all of the songs.<br /><br />But where the movie was (really) good for me it was bad in a lot of other places. The animation was kind of scary at times. Every time there was a close up shot of someones face I dont know... it just seemed scary to me. Also where the hell was Lady? She gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs Scamp at the end. She gets 0\% interaction with the plot and her only son!<br /><br />But all in all I liked it. Compared to the original does it hold up? No. The songs arent as good (still kind of catchy though) the plot was a lot less involved Lady had almost nothing to do with it and its not as cute as the first one. But if you go in with an open mind youll have fun and maybe gasp! Like it?',pos
'I cant add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here - great acting balanced writing multi-faceted characters a great anti-hero in Tony great commentary on millennial American life. The integral use of psychiatry coupled with Tonys mother issues are especially fresh and humorous. Several other characters add a lot of depth - Heshs interesting history as an outsider muscling in Ralphies total irredeemable viciousness Chris dual desires in life and so on.<br /><br />I have to dig into some of the criticisms however especially the it glorifies violence/belittles Italian-Americans one.Most of the writers and actors are Italian-American would they attack themselves? There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco the chef Dr. Melfi and her family and the Cusamanos next door to the Sopranos. Indeed Dr Melfis ex-husband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of Italian-Americans have ever had Mob connections (certainly smaller than the proportion of African-Americans involved in crime dare I say it. In both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes).<br /><br />Most of the characters dont really choose the life they have; family background or circumstances largely corner them into it. Outsiders (even of Italian stock) who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends - Matthew and his friend in season 2 for example. If you criticise this show I assume Frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist or Will & Grace made you want to go homosexual? Presumably you wont listen to rap music that discusses gangs or rnb which discusses promiscuity or rock music which discusses drugs (or any other combination)? People arent as stupid as some of you make out....<br /><br />Not everything is perfect however. A lot of characters have only appeared once when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee the dancer Meadows friend Ally Uncle Juniors ladyfriend (supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1).',pos
'Uhhh ... so did they even have writers for this? Maybe Im picky but I like a little dialog with my movies. And as far as slasher films go just a sliver of character development will suffice.<br /><br />Unfortunately The Prey provides neitherand if you think Im being hyperbolic youll just have to see it for yourself. Scene after scene we just get actors standing around looking forlorn and awkward abandoned by any sense of a script. Outside of calling out each others names when they get separated in the woods (natch) the only instances where these people say something substantive is when one character explains the constellation Orion (clearly plagiarized from Funk & Wagnalls; scintillating slasher fare no?) and another rehashes an old campfire tale that doesnt even have anything to do with the plot (wait what IS the plot?) At other times The Prey actually has the gall to film its characters with the boom mic just far away enough so that we cant exactly hear what theyre saying. So we get entire scenes wherein the actors are murmuring! Deliberately! Seriously Ive seen more dialog in a silent film. Its as if the filmmakers sat down at a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga in the heyday of the 80s slasher craze and one looked at the other and said Hey I gotta really sweet idea for a gory decapitation gag. Lets somehow pad an entire feature around it. And ... well they did. <br /><br />To be fair The Prey probably had some sort of writer on board. I mean somebody had to jot down the scene sequence and label the dailies. However I am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind whatsoever. There are glaring pauses boring tableaux and zero sense of pacing throughout. The filmmakers dont have anything else in the script to film so they fill out the running time with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teens are getting sliced and diced. These critters are all filmed in straightforward noontime daylight in a completely reserved fashion and with no attempt at atmospheric photography. If it feels like a science film thats because it is. Im pretty sure this is all nature show stock footageall thats missing is a stuffy narration from some National Geographic alderman.<br /><br />More exciting footage that was graciously spared from the cutting room floor: a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches and another scene wherein a supporting character strums away on a banjo for what feels like an entire minute-and-a- half! A minute-and-a-half! Thats a lot of banjoing to commit to celluloid to begin with let alone insert into the final cut of the film! Way to go guys! Brevity and concision are the real victims of this slaughterfest.<br /><br />Admittedly the film picks up quite a bit of steam (comparatively) in the last 25 minutes into which much of the carnage is condensed and where a rip-off of Béla Bartóks Music for Strings Percussion and Celesta cuts in. Vaudeville great Jackie Coogan makes a fun appearance as a tubby bumbly park ranger (this was his last role if you can believe it). And there are some nice gory moments including a splattery neck tearing and the aforementioned decapitation. The make-up used for the killer (Carel Struycken aka Lurch from the Addams Family movies) is also quite effective and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Plus if you love wacky straight-outta-left-field endings you need to check out how they wrap this puppy up. Youll do a spit take I promise.<br /><br />Usually I love films that are on this level of ineptitude but the first three-quarters of The Prey are just so interminably boring that they pretty much spoil the rest. Overall this is a largely pallid and tedious affair and while it aint all bad it should really only be seen by debilitated slasher completists. Why do we do this to ourselves anyway?',neg
'Why take a perfectly good original drama based on a perfectly good novel and remake it as a quasi-musical? And cast it with actors exclusively lacking in singing or dancing talent?

'I was just a bit young for this one but I had to see it. Theres some excellent music which many folks have mentioned but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by Angel a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit. Wearing their trademark white outfits they grind through 20th Century Foxes and apparently all try to cram into the cameras field of vision. Keyboardist Gregg Giuffria remains the bands highlight and has apparently never gotten much of a haircut ever! Cherie Currie (ex-Runaways singer) begins a brief but notable acting career here and is quite memorable alongside Jodie Foster and the rest. (Her topless 3-D scenes in Parasite and her UFO sighting in Wavelength kept us all watching her for a time). <br /><br />Its not a masterpiece but it preserves a chunk of its period for all to gaze upon and wonder.',pos
'Highly enjoyable very imaginative and filmic fairytale all rolled into one Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive young and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young. These three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting dazzling special effects and some solid sentiment and humour as well. Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the star(I could gaze at her for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer(I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox as the lead Tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other. Mark Strong Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well). Peter OToole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.',pos
'Watching the first few moments you realize its going to be a parody - and certainly it *is* a parody but Im not sure of what (a fairy tale? an opera? a Hollywoodian C-movie? - if there was something like that) and I can assure you its not worth watching. Its simply a pointless film (cf. a good parody is everything but pointless) with pretentious shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters. Its like a commedia dellarte. Or better its like a botched commedia dellarte. And the score... sung in an intentionally incompetent way (something Greenaway will use much more efficiently) it *is* painful to listen to (unless one wears some sate-of-the-art earplugs haha). Go for quality movies (e.g. A. Mittas How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor 1976) and steer clear of this mistake.',neg
'I had only written one review on IMDb prior to this as I consider most games as unworthy of the time and effort...Curse of Monkey Island is different.<br /><br />Having played and been impressed by Monkey 1 and 2 I had great expectations for the third release...and was not disappointed. The first thing that hit me was the substantially improved graphics. Dont get me wrong for games made in 1990 and 1991 respectively Monkey 1 and 2 were ground-breaking and provided the goods well but CMI steps up and delivers a superb cartoon-style game-play which is both fun and satisfying. All scenes and settings have been carefully crafted and well thought out and suit this type of game perfectly. The animation/CGI is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; a fantastic combination in this case. <br /><br />For me the script has been crucial in the success of the previous two games. The CMI script is clever appropriate and above all absolutely hilarious. Added to this the script is now audio unlike the previous two where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. Dominic Armatos voice is perfect for Guybrush: witty clear and slightly naive. All other voice talents fit their characters perfectly especially Earl Boen who is the voice behind LeChuck. I loved every single character throughout the game: not just their personalities and wit but the way each character is animated superbly and distinctively. Whilst on the subject of audio effects the soundtrack is worth a mention. The soundtracks for Monkey 1 and 2 were both monotone and despite this were very effective at giving atmosphere and representing a change in mood. CMIs soundtrack is once again a step up. Each scene is complemented by a catchy subtle playful and piratey (if thats a word) tune. With a change in setting or mood the music also adapts adding to the entertainment and amusement that the game offers.<br /><br />The whole idea behind Monkey Island is to solve puzzles and problems in order to progress. This might sound easy but is actually devilishly tricky in many places. Some may be put off by the level of logic and amount of thinking that goes into Monkey Island but in reality this makes the game even more entertaining and fun and also adds to the replay value. The option of The Curse of Monkey Island or The Curse of Monkey Island: Mega-Monkey (which involves trickier and more abundant puzzles) suits players of all abilities and also gives good cause to play the game at least twice. Whatever difficulty level you choose you are guaranteed a different game each time you replay with numerous speech options and other puzzles to solve that dont affect the outcome of the game but are just there for fun. The most entertaining section of the game is Ship Combat and the sword fights that follow. These were particularly well thought out and make the game completely worthwhile. Add to this a stupendous story that is non-violent and suitable for all ages which will keep you hooked and wanting more until the very end.<br /><br />Finally in conclusion a uniquely special mention must go to the designers of this game. The way each complex puzzle and problem is thought out is simply astonishing. Whilst gathering up items and objects during game-play you cant see how each one is going to help you progress but with a little thought and perseverance solutions present themselves and for that the designers of CMI must be highly commended.<br /><br />10/10 for the best game I have ever played (not an exaggeration)',pos
'This pictures following will only grow as time goes by. Better than any of the best picture nominees in 97 and it rewards repeated viewings. Ive seen it three times now so I know. Anderson was compared to some of the great American directors (Altman Scorcese Tarantino) and he may have those influences but chances are after a few more films hell be considered part of that short list himself.<br /><br />One last note: Julianne Moores Amber Waves will resonate in the memory long after other 90s movie characters have faded. THE best performance of the year -in any of the four categories.',pos
'Who are these They- the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldnt be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. Its the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun nobody is getting any actual work done and that almost always makes for a movie thats no fun to watch.<br /><br />Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his characters status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet but have an embarrassing look-guys-Im-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cats-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime the budding couples respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovichs daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on love while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn drawing on her dignity manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself ostensibly.) Everybody looks great but so what? Its a movie and we can expect that much if thats what youre looking for youd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.<br /><br />Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys even apart from her singing which while competent is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movies title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20s may have been slight but at least they were long on charm. They All Laughed tries to coast on its good intentions but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didnt prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories so theres no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Strattens scenes. But Laughed is a faint echo of The Last Picture Show Paper Moon or Whats Up Doc- following Daisy Miller and At Long Last Love it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged.<br /><br />All in all though the movie is harmless only a waste of rental. I want to watch people having a good time Ill go to the park on a sunny day. For filmic expressions of joy and love Ill stick to Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy...',neg
'I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoons portrayal of Dani Trant a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister Maureen (a now rarely seen Emily Warfield) and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen year old Court Foster (Jason London) the son of her mothers close friend (Gail Strickland) moves in next door Dani experiences her first crush while Court enjoys her company and willful spirit. Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him but as soon as he sees Maureen he falls head over heels for her leaving Dani behind. The sisters close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other.<br /><br />Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents trying to balance their daughters individuality at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the films atmosphere of a simpler time.<br /><br />A touching coming-of-age film with a timeless message.',pos
'Home Alone 3 is the first of the Home Alone movies not to feature Culkin in the main role and the same villains. However the plot is very similar to the original Home Alone film. Instead of two comical villains we get three or four of them. This film involves some traps but it also has a long scene with a remote-control car. The slapstick humour is consistent as well but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film. (No pun intended.) This film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did and there really is not the warm holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had. Its more of a pure comedy but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me. I would not recommend this film; its pretty boring. If you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy then watch the original Home Alone movie.',neg
'I first saw this film during and International Film Studies course. I am a non-traditional student and perhaps for reasons of years-lived or wisdom-accrued appreciated the slow reflective pacing of the films narrative. Languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime the story is deeply psychological replete with multi-layered symbolism and an articulate inversion of the theme of being the Other in a land that one does not understand. the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Made nearly 20 years ago it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered. Much more lavishly filmed---and heavily financed--- works that have been made since reflect the same themes: Indochine Nowhere in Africa are two that in comparison perhaps make Chocolat seem pale and boring. It has no adrenaline-pumping action or extreme violence. The struggles are mental emotional and subtle. But that being said it is a fine film worth a viewing.',pos
'I think this film has to be one of the most moving and heartbreaking films of recent times.<br /><br />The film basically starts off with a suicide in a school toilet. U dont see who it is then from there it goes to the beginning of the day and we get to know 6 characters and they are going through some pretty heavy things anyway eventually one of them will commit suicide.<br /><br />Ive been teaching Physical Education in schools for 8 years now and never in a film have I seen such an accurate portrayal of what really goes on in school life.<br /><br />The film is shot beautifully and sounds incredible.<br /><br />The ending is so shocking and so what one would not expect it is something that will haunt me for days to come. <br /><br />This is Definitely one to watch.<br /><br />I think the fact that the Director/Writer was in school only a few years ago is a major contributing factor to the raw honesty expressed in the film. <br /><br />The film is shot in two separate modes if you will. Firstly there is the smooth observation style where we get to know the characters in their school environment as they go through their drama but the stunning part of the film is in the interview sections where we get to know the characters back stories and their deepest darkest thoughts.<br /><br />You keep wondering who is it going to be (who commits suicide) and as the drama unfolds you keep changing your mind until bam it hits you in the face in the final five minutes. I am all over the place in my writing but Ive just seen it at a Media screening in Australia and I am still in a bit of shock. <br /><br />Its one of the best Australian Films I have seen in recent years.',pos
'I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now Ive seen the film!! What a ride! And what a trip to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a courageous wise funny and talented spirit! And what a Crew! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in Louisiana the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon the excitement of rafting through some rapids the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi and the phone calls home and as always - boys will be boys. This film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. And the Crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility problems; they took Darius on the trip of his life; and they touched many many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research this film will help accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.',pos
'This movie was awful plain and simple. It will probably be revered by those who only see films and not movies and will therefore feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film but I am secure enough in my intellect to say that this boring self-aggrandizing and painfully drawn-out movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars.<br /><br />I was suckered into seeing this by the inexplicable good reviews it had been receiving and came out of the theater thinking that those reviews had to have been written by over-excited film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who shun regular movies perhaps for fear that they may actually enjoy one someday.<br /><br />The storyline is quite a promising one - a man is imprisoned for 15 years never knowing his captor nor his crime. He is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. However the great concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as Oh Dae-Su runs around beating people up trying to have sex with a young girl who is attempting to use the toilet and eating a live writhing squid (presumably for dramatic effect as there is absolutely no other reason for it). All the while he is trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn himself fifteen years in jail and when he finally finds out it is both ridiculous and a major letdown. His nemesis a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man looks like a Banana Republic model twenty years younger than him. Hey I know prison has been hard on Oh Dae-Su but is it too much to ask to find an actor that looks a bit closer to his age? Of all the things wrong with this movie this one seems like the easiest one to fix.<br /><br />And the big secret - the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when I could have been out doing something productive - is some joke of a plot line involving incest and a rumor started in high school. Come on! Throw us a bone here - was that really the best they could do? I sat through stupid dialogue over-acting gloomy sets and gratuitous violence for this? (By the way - Im not at all against violence in a film if it seems to fit the story but in this case it seems I was forced to watch our hero knock out someones front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of scissors in order to distract me from figuring out I was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of garbage).<br /><br />Take my advice - do something else with your time and money. Or take your nine dollars and go see a lowly movie - one that you might actually enjoy.',neg
'A great film. Every moment masterfully conducted by Toyoda and his crew. The actors give credible performances all around.The visuals are hauntingbeautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the Japanese country and city landscapes.The soundscourtesy of Japanese band Dig are never overly edgy as one would expect from band-made soundtracks. Its strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes theyre on. <br /><br />All in all they worked everything out perfectly....Well if they were to give any justice to the story perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted. <br /><br />The real greatness of 9 Souls is the compelling story. The prison break movie maybe something of a lost genre these days and road trip movie losing its appeal due to the way the world is getting smaller. But this story easily mixes something fresh to those two genres.<br /><br />9 convicts are given freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their places in society. will society accept them? will they be truly free of their dark pasts? and can they stick together long enough to stay alive and find out? <br /><br />Each convict has an interesting history. Their crimes are as varied as their apparent fates. A sense of brotherhood among them keeps the story high on drama and supplies it with hilariously comedic situations. And due to the nature of their backgrounds violence is always something waiting to happen.<br /><br />After all that all i can say is go give it a watch.',pos
'Yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award-material. But then it doesnt try to be anything it is not. A fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners a stellar and very funny performance by Peter OToole a grounding and down to earth performance from Joan Plowright. The bands performance was on the spot each one playing their role in a deft comical manner. The music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely. From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads. A good example is the comment about the strange baseball-like game well my dear American that was cricket -from which baseball is derived- and the explaining of it to the ignorant US band was very funny for those that do know cricket. Also no you were not supposed to wince when Carl broke a window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said oh yes! to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time oh no also referring to the money. Jeez it seems that every joke must be explained to some people... All-in-all I enjoyed it and had some great laughs! Well worth seeing.',pos
'The message of Hero is quite clear: the idea of Greater China is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced government-sponsored dogmatic trash.<br /><br />Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune David Edelstein of Slate Charles Taylor of Salon and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero. In so doing they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. The only critic (that I know of) who saw through the films glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice who wrote of the films sanctimonious traditionalism and its glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness. I for one sign my name under Hobermans final pronouncement: Hero is nothing more than fascinating fascism.',neg
'I had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing but I just found it annoying. Its been a while since Ive seen it (and hopefully I wont find out all my memories are wrong and Im unjustly condemning this movie) but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as victimized by an anti-gay society and that this somehow caused their horrible crime. I totally disagree with this point of view and think its unfair both to homosexuals and to Bobby Franks the real victim of the story. I cant imagine why anyone would want to claim those two as martyrs. I also thought L&L were portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they actually were--after all they were teenagers who lived at home. The film places them in a kind of fantasy world that seems like it should be scored by Morrissey.<br /><br />I just read an interview with one of the filmmakers that implied the films anachronisms such as the push-button phones that characters used were meant to add Brechtian distance. They certainly do that but I happened to find it highly irksome.<br /><br />Apparently a number of people found this movie interesting but I would have preferred a less stylish and more realistic examination of the part homosexuality may have played in the Leopold & Loeb case.',neg
'This movie rocked!!!! saw it at a screener a coupla weeks ago. Kinda a strange story where James Franco plays this jerk who marries Sienna Miller just to get out of the country and they go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. Dont wanna give it away cuz the movie isnt released yet but its totally cool and you would never expect the stuff that happens. I kinda thought I would hate it cuz its a romance but its also kinda twisted and stuff which I like a lot. The acting is really good and Sienna Miller is totally smokin and plays this really sweet girl. I think she should do more roles like this. James plays a jerk but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. I gave this movie a 10 because I came out of the movie really liking it and wanting to see it again which I didnt expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried. good date flick',pos

'This film is excellently paced you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and theres much more going on than the initial premise of the film. Throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy local-boys-done-good-overcoming-adversity genre of which this parodies. Dont let anyone tell you that theyre trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities;- sure theres plenty of that but its all contextual not gratuitous. I loved this film and it only cost me £2.99 on DVD  so in terms of entertainment value for money it has been the best film Ive seen this year.',pos
'If youre a fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern music youre in great luck. This film is a documentary of current music in Istanbul spanning the traditional to the modern. Its very good.

'Okay Ill admit that if I didnt have kids I never would have seen this film and would never see it. But considering all the rotten kids movies I have seen (such as SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY) this is a significant improvement. And it had enough in it that I wasnt totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide (something I did repeatedly in the other two movies). Sure the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly--but it IS a kids film. And compared with other films in the genre this is definitely better than average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after puberty--at least on infomercials or doing voice-overs.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a film to see with your kids you certainly could do a lot worse!',pos
'This is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what theyre thoughts are. I dont know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit. It also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities.Put humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out. For once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice-over for the first has been removed. Only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murderproving thatafter allanimals are more interesting than people',pos

'How can anyone argue the fact that Urban Cowboy was and still is the best document of Texas life for the time period. Consider the following: men beat their wives get drunk at bars nightly get married to settle a fight commit adultery and compete on mechanical bulls. Try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly. They dont make them anymore. It seems current films are always about people with lots of money they live in huge homes drive expensive cars and dont work. This movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for petes sake !<br /><br />Anyway I watch it at least once a week. No kidding. I have dissected this movie from end to end. feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary. Consider the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are split up - he amicably honks and waves she flips him the bird - he returns half the peace sign honking his horn to add impact then tears off.<br /><br />Buds mom calls him approx. 18 hours after he gets into town on a Sunday to see if he has a job yet - all he has accomplished is getting drunk and laid(x2) with help from his uncle and aunt who cover for him.<br /><br />You all live like pigs Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. Was it necessary ? Could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink ? God I love that !<br /><br />Sissy allows Wes to help her ride the bull. Only a few days (or possibly the next day) after Wes just kicked the crap out of her husband. Steve asks - Hey Sissy remember Wes ? Oh yeah didnt you beat my husband up the other night so lets get this lesson goin to make no mention of the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one Bud and Sissys many fights which by the way all take place in public - in Gilleys !<br /><br />The Wedding reception picture taking session (oh the humanity !) could they at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way. My legs are sweatin momma<br /><br />In conclusion you dont put scenes like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology.

'I tried. God knows I tried to like this Swiss Cheese of a movie but the story was too full of holes some big enough to drive a horse drawn carriage through. The acting overall was even and the characters endearing enough that you regretted they died off like recently sprayed roaches scattering off to die their own gruesome deaths. Overall however it was not really very scary. Afterall we have seen spooky quickly moving figures in the background since The Brood why back when / and it was scary then just briefly. This film just never resolved the basic plot points and thats the writers job. Naturally you would expect the director to pick up on the fact that the story did not make sense. Like whos was the secret room behind the wardrobe why did the blood hungry ghost not die when she received the nails as prescribed by the book they read earlier? Why did the computer say game over for Frankies character even though he lived? The list goes on and on. I dont really feel comfortable recommending this film as its makes you feel like you wasted your time and there was not enough payoff in truly scary moments.',neg
'Wow. So my boyfriend and I went to the movie store to rent a film. I like dumb horror movies so I browsed the variety of terrible films they had to offer while he went off in search of Michael Moores Sicko. So then I found the worst of all of them (as I would soon find out). It looked good on the cover and the description on the back seemed decent enough. The fact that there was an IMDb quote on it as a review was proof that it would be bad in a good way. So the next night we put it in the DVD player and from the first five minutes we were so incredibly confused.<br /><br />The movie is utterly incoherent with badly placed time-jumps from past to future that leave you asking a major WTF? The plot has no sort of coherent story -- other than the vague allusion to a local myth about a murder but this only actually comes into play in the movie in the last twenty minutes of it. So pretty much for the first hour you have this: random confusing time jumps; incoherent plot; parents who dont age; bad acting; bad dialogue; a boy who magically changes hair colour; and a host of obnoxious characters for you to get bored with!<br /><br />The movie moves so slow that its a chore to actually sit there and watch. Id rather be scrubbing the toilets honestly. Dont bother with it.',neg

Fortunately(or unfortunately) a couple of my buddies stayed till the end. When they woke up from their coma and after a couple of weeks of therapy they were able to fill me in on what I had missed.

'Going into the movie with the right expectations I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie I fully agree that the plot was razor thin clichéd and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But the dancing sequences were VERY well done and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good which made the drama scenes more bearable. The leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing.<br /><br />All in all a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences and this movie is MUCH MUCH MUCH better than You Got Served in terms of the plot and drama.

This is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting.<br /><br />I would prefer this movie to many A rate movies I have seen even a great number with high box office earnings.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.',pos
'Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them. As I watched this film made in 1988 in 1999 I thought I was watching the O.J. Simpson debacle (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation).<br /><br />The Australian news media if this movie is to be believed devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought. It was scary to see the scenes of invasive swarming media hordes ridiculous accounts of half-truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society.<br /><br />Equally appalling is the medias depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case. I do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case (the accused are Seven-Day Adventists).<br /><br />Today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important.<br /><br />Streep is excellent as usual and this is the best Ive ever seen Sam Neill. The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible.',pos
'The back of the DVD for this movie raves Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films. This isnt so much an insult to Quentin as it is to Christian films. This film is poorly written stiffly acted and edited with a purposeless intensity. The scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice time-lapse photography. Flashbacks fades to grey freeze frames to tell the time (unimportant in the story) are all done with out any apparent reason other than to give the movie more cinematic credibility. The camera is haphazard some nice crane shots are cut with ridiculous montages that have no significance. Poor blocking and lighting leave the viewer wondering who is talking to who in many scenes. Oh and the audio is terrible. The special effects were decent and thankfully limited. But this is all just technical. The movie fails to engage on an emotional level. The dialogue is so fake sounding and the actors seem to have only read it a moment before the camera was rolling. The story... the things that happen in sequence have no motivation behind them. The characters are struggling to take hold of one dimensionality. And the characters have to make a stance on Christianity and faith in every single scene. Take a queue from M. Night engaging Christian films dont have to have the characters saying the name of Jesus Christ in every scene for the movie to be Christian. Goodness! Please dont try to show this to your unsaved friends with any expectations other than laughter.',neg
'Falls into the film category of Way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments to be taken seriously. Whereas Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth or My Boyfriends Back know they are bad Scarecrows doesnt. Evil Dead set such a high standard for the comedic horror on a budget genre that Scarecrows is simply out of place. <br /><br />Suspicions of inexperience are immediately at play as there are no hints of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an airborne plane. The repeated display of a picture of 3 men just screams for a story arc but nothing comes. Although the men are obviously the scarecrows there is no explanation.<br /><br />Knowing this film is too serious for its own good may produce some grins. I dont recall if Joe Bob Briggs ever previewed Scarecrows but I believe that he wouldnt stoop this low. However with an IMDb rating of over 6 there are many people that disagree.',neg
'Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty easily one of the most charming off-beat and lighthearted comedies of the year.<br /><br />When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husbands murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock) she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).<br /><br />As the two oddly paired Hitmen the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona. Renee Zellweger turns in an innocent candy-coated and sometimes terribly sweet performance as Nurse Betty. She exudes goodness warmth and is irresistible. While the script sometimes feels like a sit-com is filled with sometimes unbelievable characters and contrived situations Zellweger is so likeable and so utterly disarming that it all comes together.<br /><br />With just a few splashes of black comedy to keep things interesting a winning performance from Zellweger a great supporting cast and a competent script Nurse Betty is utterly delightful.<br /><br />7 out of 10',pos
'When this was released I thought this was one of the most profane films ever made. However thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him there have been mainline films worse language-wise than this....but this is a pretty brutal assault on ones ears. Hey I can take a lot of it but this got ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone I heard a half-dozen usages of the Lords name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. I wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? I couldnt have been the only one.<br /><br />Not surprisingly some of the feature actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh Burt Young Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image at least playing the Godly Stonewall Jackson in Gods and Generals. Langs role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.<br /><br />Depressing gloomy semi-pornographic repulsive: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some Liberal critics - in describing this story which is painted even worse in the novel. Of course some of the better-known critics all extreme Libs praised the movie. However they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted as well almost all of the paying public. Its unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this.<br /><br />Trust me on this: there are no good likable characters in this entire movie. This is a mean sick film: one of the worst of the modern era. That is unless you enjoy seeing child abuse drug abuse teen prostitutes on and on - two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people. No thanks.',neg

'There is a difference between a film and a movie. A film regardless of quality is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a viewer I have seen may examples of both.<br /><br />On September 19 I attended a screening of writer/director Jon Satejowskis Donnybrook. Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the finished product) of this piece I can safely say it is a movie. And a student movie at that. It is for lack of a better word competent which is to say the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images. The visuals are for the most part static and unimpressive and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film but some visual flair would have been appreciated and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested.<br /><br />Granted there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written engrossing story and some sharp dialog. Steven Soderberghs sex lies and videotape comes immediately to mind. This movie however has neither. The main story is weak and unfocused. If the main plot is Davie trying to mend his relationship with his father then I feel this movie misses the point. What I got out of it is that Davies main aspiration is to change the face of rock n roll. However we see very little activity on his part to show this. While there is one dream sequence at the beginning and an impromptu performance of his at the end all we seem to get are scenes of Davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar. We are simply told that Davie has played a lot of gigs but we never see him in full rock out mode. Next time SHOW dont TELL the audience. Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this. Also Davie doesnt look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970s; he looks like hed be more comfortable in the early days of rock n roll posing as James Deans less talented brother. In the meantime the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather cliché characters and story threads that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency (i.e. the subplot involving Terrys father). If I want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction I will consider watching Napolean Dynamite again a film I could barely make it through the first time.<br /><br />As for the above mentioned dialog scenes I guess I should mention that they are few and extremely far between. Is it too much to ask for characters who do speak? I dont think it is. When the characters do speak it is in short choppy sentences; collections of oh so insightful questions angered grunts or wildly over-the-top outbursts. These characters simply do not behave like normal rational people. Working with material like this it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film Al Hudsons and thats just because hes doing a poor imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on screen. A good director or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them. However with Satejowski being so close to the material he simply doesnt see them or if he does he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because itll hurt his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner is the mark of a self-indulgent misguided fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. <br /><br />In the end we are left with a poor high-school-set knock-off of Zach Braffs amazing Garden State combined with the equally amazing Velvet Goldmine two films far more worthy of your time.<br /><br />Now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review allow me to offer this. The best I can do is compliment Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see. However the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur. This is a student movie nothing more nothing less. If the movie holds any promise (and lets face it at this point it isnt going to come from the acting writing or directing) it is this: If IF the people associated with this film are willing then please learn from this movie file it away and use the lessons learned on your next attempt; dont attack your critics or have friend or family do it for you. If you are able to do this maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution worthy of being called a film.<br /><br />I am your audience and I am willing to watch.',neg
'When John Wayne filmed his Alamo story he had built a complete Alamo set in the town of Brackettsville Texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction. As long as that stands we will have a set for future Alamo interpretations for the screen. One such with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was done in this century.<br /><br />But I would say The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory is the best Alamo story filmed Ive seen. John Waynes film is a good one if over-hyped but its a John Wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of John Wayne. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he was.<br /><br />Its a lot closer to Professor Lon Tinkles book on The Alamo than the Wayne film was and having read the book years ago I can attest to that. Tinkles book is listed as the source in both films but Tinkle who was alive back then when the Wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the result.<br /><br />Alec Baldwin was around the right age for young William Barrett Travis the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner. Back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that. One thing that was not explored and hasnt been was Traviss hyperactive sex drive. He was the Casanova of the Southwest he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquests.<br /><br />But the man who always gets the whitewash is Jim Bowie played here by James Arness. He was a hero at the Alamo to be sure but his career before the Alamo was that of a scoundrel. He was a smuggler a slave trader an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to. But his heroic death certainly redeemed him. No hint of that is in Arnesss portrayal nor any others Ive seen of Bowie on the screen. And of course he did design the Bowie knife done to his specifications. That man needed such a weapon.<br /><br />However the main asset that The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory has is a full blown portrayal of Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna the president of Mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the North Americans whove come to settle in Texas at Mexican invitation. Unfortunately those Americans came with some pre-conceived notions about liberty that just hadnt made it that far south at least liberty for white people. Raul Julia plays Santa Anna who remains an even more controversial figure in Mexican history. He was also quite the scoundrel but he was the best Mexico produced until a genuine reformer named Benito Juarez came along.<br /><br />This film was the farewell performance of Lorne Greene who appears briefly as General Sam Houston. Greenes not quite my conception of Houston he really was way too old for the part Houston was in his early forties in 1836 he was not yet the patriarch of Texas. But within the limits imposed on him Greene does a fine job.<br /><br />For a romantic telling of The Alamo tale by all means see John Waynes version but for historical content I recommend this film highly.',pos
'In the wake of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels the British film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late 90s-early 00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then. In one of the all-time great cases of pearls-from-swine the producers of Rancid Aluminium brazenly plastered the quote The best film of the century from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because at the time of writing it was the only film that had been released in 2000. Looking at it today its hard to imagine how it ever got made uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of Cool Britannias Lads Mags Brigade  Rhys Ifans Sadie Frost Nick Moran and Joseph Fiennes  but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused James Hawes novel. That the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no-one really knows what it is or perhaps simply dont think it matters. Something to do with Ifans businessman being set up with Steven Berkoffs homicidal Russian crime lord in a money-laundering or investment scheme (its never clear which because no-one ever asks) by Fiennes crooked Irish accountant who expects the Russians to kill off Ifans so he can take over his failing company. Things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on Ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and Tara Fitzgeralds ludicrously accented Russian temptress Berkoff keeps on saying Bizniss and Francis Drake and Fiennes does a decent Irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in Shakespeare in Love doesnt mean hes any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts.<br /><br />When the most convincing performances come from Keith Allen and Dani Behr you know a film is in deep trouble. With Poland standing in for a Russia filled with people with Polish accents and a strange score that veers from John Barry pastiche to lounge music to Ennio Morricone spaghetti Western on a stylophone budget it fails completely in the cool stakes its aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own sitting there like a joke shop dog turd.',neg

'I wish kids movies were still made this way; dark and deep. There was (get this) character development (and Charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character) plot development superb animation emotional involvement and a rational relatable and consistent theme. If not for the handful of song-and-dance routines you would never have thought this was a kids movie and this is why I give it such a high rating. This movie is an excellent film let alone for a kids movie. Which brings me to my second point: this has got to be the darkest kids movie Ive seen in quite some time this coming from a 22-year-old. Id be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across (ala Jurassic Bark for those of you who are Futurama fans) and this is what makes this movie so good. Just because the movie universally evokes emotions we dont normally like to feel and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad; in fact it means it succeeded. Good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh; good horror movies are supposed to make us scared; good sad movies are supposed to make us sad. My point is good movies are supposed to MOVE you not simply entertain; this movie moved me.<br /><br />Also this movie is incredibly violent by todays standards for a kids movie and contains subject matter that by todays standards may not be suitable for some children. Parents Id say watch it first. Im not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing but I just saw this yesterday and it came as a surprise even to me.',pos
'As a bit of a Michael Dudikoff fan I sat down to watch one of his good old-fashioned actioners - Im still waiting.<br /><br />The film is based around a group of US commandos trying to get rid of a bunch of Syrian terrorists who have taken over a nuclear reactor. Maddie Reese (Felicity Waterman) was an English member of the commando unit and of course she became romantically involved with Tom Dickson (Dudikoff). I must ask since when have the Brits had female SAS members - as far as I know if they are ever needed they are got from other sources. Even if they did I can pretty much guarantee they wouldnt be as wet as Maddie Reese. I would also think that Tom Dickson would be a little more responsible in his position - or have I lost the plot?! I know there is always the romantic angle in these films as it helps provide the feelgood factor but does it have to be throughout especially when theres more important things to be taken into consideration - like nuclear warfare!<br /><br />The signing of the treaty on the US aircraft carrier intrigued me. The sacred pen as carried by one of the supposed TV news crew - are there were no security checks to find out who or what goes on board one of these ships especially with the calibre of people that was on it. Mind you if there was I suppose there would be no story.<br /><br />I could go on but when it got to inner body bomb defusion in order to safely remove a bullet I gave up on the action drama movie bit and enjoyed it for the comedy it actually was.<br /><br />By the way would a news reporter really say Downtown Damascus??',neg

'The first film was a nice one but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is inferior but not bad at all. Sure the slapstick is too much the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are very cute here and Eric Idle is hilarious as the macaw. The film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes(especially Cruellas) and the music is pleasant. The acting is mostly very good Ioan Gruffudd is appealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruellas accomplice. But the best asset as it was with the first film is the amazing Glenn Close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as Cruella even more evil than she was previously. Overall nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox',pos
'Frankly i just enjoy watching James Caan. Wonderful actor. With such simplicity you know exactly what hes thinking. A true pro.<br /><br />I have watched the show from the very beginning and found it different - thats something that is unique in Hollywood - a new idea - not a 3rd version of a current hit show - <br /><br />I also find the show fun and exciting -I like the pacing - youre never bored - I especially like the mystery in each episode - the way it unfolds. I am a big mystery fan and have read a lot of the great mysteries but I find the stories in the show well written and the outcome is rarely obvious. Also extremely interesting to me probably because I am not a gambler is the different cons that the gamblers come up with - I was fascinated by the number of schemes that people have come up with to rob Las Vegas. The music: I like the music at the top of the show. Absolutely perfect for the show...Sets the tone and atmosphere . Just marvelous. And of course there is James Caan.',pos
'A Smile LIke Yours is a pathetic comedy that actually makes no sense. I dont mean that the story was complicated but the entire plot is based on one thing: a couples desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children. People who tried that hard mustve forgotten of the option of the adoption to which this movie is not kind to.<br /><br />Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson a complete contradiction to anything offered by the womens liberation movement exhibiting almost no sense of independence. She is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her mind but to have kids. Like a dumb 50s romance comedy Greg Kinnear is her submitting husband who likewise displays no personality no independence and from us no interest.<br /><br />They are the two most boring and often annoying characters and they hardly make for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps which should arise from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant. Except they really dont do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own (except for that in vitro fertilization number). The plot hardly allows for any mishaps because well the couple dont do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation. They just go to this clinic. So what?<br /><br />The subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together. Jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend (played by Joan Cusak) and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs. Christopher MacDonald plays the intrested buyer and Jennifer is the promising negotiator of a pretty price for her and her friends product. The subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested (although Joan Cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scene).<br /><br />Danny (Kinear) is an architect who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills by taking on a job in Seattle where his boss is the crass seductress (also another hopeless helpless female character) who tries to influence Danny (as dumb as he is) to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife (for reasons I dont care to give away). Jill Hennesy is good in the role but her character is too predictable and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for Danny. It is stupid and once again hardly interesting. <br /><br />The overall movie itself is utterly boring and hardly funny at all (save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight). The plot offers nothing that is really attention-grabbing. Even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive the writers couldve figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that. Second the main characters are completely boring. They are complete silouhettes of dumb 1950s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband. So even without mishaps present in the plot the characters themselves offer nothing interesting let alone funny.<br /><br />Joan Cusak shouldve been in the lead and someone else shouldve taken Kinnears part. Cusak wouldve made even a lousy story outrageously funny (as she sometimes does in her co-starring role here). This is definitely one to pass up.',neg

'This flick which is a.k.a. Life In the Fast Lane is easily one of the least entertaining movies Ive seen in a long time.

After she stabs her boyfriend in the head with some scissors a cheap laugh is attempted (and unsucceeds) by sticking a cork in the boyfriends skull to stop the bleeding. Oh clever! Patrick Dempsey (whose movies are almost always a class act --sarcasm) plays this devil who changes her life - but from what weve seen her life was this series of vignettes to begin with. No emotion no laughs no story. The only reason I give this a 2 is that Jeffrey Jones is ok as the priest and there is a bit of style (albiet zero substance) in the camerawork. Otherwise one of the 5 worst films Ive seen. Grade 2 out of 10 AN F! I think that even the most drugged out junkie who would laugh at a toilet seat falling would dislike this film.

'Fans of the HBO series Tales From the Crypt are going to love this MOH episode. Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on will recognize this one right off the bat.<br /><br />Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way. He could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness. In the case of RIGHT TO DIE he takes the latter approach and it definitely works.<br /><br />Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (Robin Sydney) much to the displeasure of his inconsolable unforgiving spouse Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up and shes horribly burned in a fire hes reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen looking the worse for wear these days.) <br /><br />But Abbeys never been one to give up without a fight and thats where the EC-theme of the episode comes in. Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genres favorite subject matter for some spooky (and OOKY) supernatural shenanigans and this case is definitely no exception. If anything the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.<br /><br />And thats not to mention that John Espositos original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist. You dont realize as youre watching that you only know half the story until close to the end...(think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas and youre there.)<br /><br />Not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either. At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed! As with most MOH episodes this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment so the extremely squeamish need not apply.',pos
'A Family Affair takes us back to a less complicated time in America. Its sobering to see how different everything was back then. It was a more innocent era in our country and we watch a functional family dealing in things together. The film also marks the beginning of the series featuring the Hardy family.<br /><br />The film directed by George Seitz is based on a successful play. Judge James Hardy and his wife Emmily are facing a domestic crisis that must be dealt with. Married daughter Joan comes home after she has committed a social blunder and her husband holds her responsible. At the same time another daughter Marion brings home a beau who is clear will clash with her father. The happy teen ager Andy seems to be the only one without a problem until his mother makes him escort Polly to the dance something he is reluctant to do.<br /><br />Needless to say Judge Hardy will prove why he knows best as he puts a plan into action to get everyone together again. After all he is a man that understands not only the law but how to deal with those outside forces that threatens his standing in the community and what will make his family happy.<br /><br />Lionel Barrymore plays Judge Hardy with conviction. He is the glue that holds everything together. Spring Byington is seen as Emily the mother. Mickey Rooney has a small part in this film but he is as always fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as the daughters Marion and Joan. Sara Hayden and Margaret Marquis are also featured in the film as Aunt Milly and Polly the girl that surprises Andy with her beauty.<br /><br />A Family Affair is a good way to observe our past through the positive image painted of an American family.',pos

'As a CA resident Id like to see the jackholes who were shutting down the electricity plants to raise the prices get some jail time too. <br /><br />I thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces. While they stuck to how Enron rose and crashed I found it really interesting. However when the movie focused on its anti-Bush slant it made me wonder if they were really being accurate. <br /><br />Its fine to point out any connection the Republicans had to Enron but the monster was created while Clinton was president. The CA energy crisis happened under Daviss watch. Both were in office during Enrons abuses but neither are held accountable in any way. Rather many minutes are spent on how Bush was friends with Lay. So what? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom. Why are Democrats given such a free pass in this film? I think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money so Im not partial to either party but I hate feeling like Im subject to someones political agenda when I watch a documentary. Yes politicians deserve some blame but I really doubt that the only guilty ones have Rs after their names. I found no value in portraying the Bushs as Kay-lovers when Democrats received just as much Enron campaign money as Republicans did. Like I said it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out.',neg

'Let us assume for a moment that you havent experimented with the psychotropic mushroom and youre wondering about the so called bad experience and just how something like that might play itself out Well go ahead and pop in a fresh copy of The Beguiled. See with film you have your clean trips (Solaris and anything else directed by Andrei Tarkovsky) whack trips i.e. the experience-from-which-you-never-recover (Sweet Movie and El Topo) and youre bad organic trips a category specifically reserved for a film like The Beguiled which is the sort of content those keen writers at the Times who made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the Harvard Department of English refer to as hallucinogenic in tone. By the third act of this Don Siegel directed movie you may not exactly observe that your two lead-heavy hands have become shrunken and assume all the characteristics of a burrowing insectivorous mammal nor will you exactly fall under the suspicion that your spine has achieved the same sinuous shape and knotty texture of a pomaceous fruit baring tree incalculable in age but you will feel something.<br /><br />In 1970 when this film was filmed most Americans were looking for an anodyne for their collective pain a movie like The Graduate perhaps a lot of world-endism was going on and of course you had the nightmare break down of war in Vietnam. What you get with The Beguiled banal drug metaphors aside is a screenplay adapted from a novel by a guy who at least for the moment wanted to be known as Grimes Grice and direction from the director who helped bring about the work and career of Sam Peckinpah. In the Beguiled Donny Siegel born in 12 Chicago Il. less than 45 years after The Great Fire is showing his attempt at grappling with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970s in the form of a classical film artifact. The Beguiled is an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect: the shooting editing direction and story are all fantastic and youre not likely to see anything else like it. Undoubtedly a sinister film its effects as Ive said both dizzying and adulterating; frankly its hard to believe would ever Universal attached its name to this picture but you are going to see upon viewing some of the sweet sweet camera moves and cinematographer Bruce Surtees exploiting every bit of dark myth you harbor in your head about the American Plantation South conflating beauty with evil in every location shot. Clint Eastwood needless to say has never been like this. Old Clint he moves at instant from coy to livid his eyes like two Archimedean spirals in medium close up. The rest of the cast is equally exacting and uncanny.<br /><br />This Beguiled will never make the AFI 100 in my lifetime but that doesnt stop me from positing that its one of the best American synch sound films ever made. While most people catalogue it as a western to include the folks at The Western Channel The Beguiled is a problem because you dont really know what it is: A sort of war movie? A drama? Psychological thriller? Maybe the answer to all those emotionally wrought Noir films starring Kirk Douglas? I actually call this piece a horror film because when my old man who likes to kick back with the cheap gratuitous violence projected in entertainments like The Wire saw that high angle medium long shot of Geraldine Page wrapping a tourniquet around Clints bloody leg Pa was pretty quick to suggest we watch something else like the Outback Bowl right before he absconded to another room. My advice: watch this one and make sure it is on a very large screen preferably run on that DPL home theater projector youre contemplating. I would put The Beguiled right on order along with that important consumer purchase turn the overheads out throw some cinematic light up on the big blank wall and try not to lose your grip because just like Norman Bates We all go a little mad sometimes even the beguiled.',pos
'There are so many things wrong with this movie I dont even know where to begin. The story is not cohesive AT ALL. I guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his/her head in confusion.<br /><br />Heres what I remember of the movie before I was bored into unconsciousness: A quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all. In the next scene the girls are about 15. Theyre driving with their parents and hit a deer. The deer must have been explosive because their car blows up one sister drags the other from the burning wreckage. Then the girls are drifting in a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. In the very next scene the girls are hitchhiking toward a military base. And what a military base it is. Actually its more like a hog farm converted to look like a military base with plenty of confused extras playing soldiers. The base commanders office is particularly awesome because there are random things like an AK-47 hanging on the wall and a drill sergeant hat mounted to a plaque (????) so the audience is sure to know that this is a military guys office. Then some random dude pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to go into town to buy some porn mags and to make sure the soldiers dont think that hes on the pink team. So our character takes a pickup converted to look like an army truck to town and loads up a box from a nondescript book store with a blowup doll by the front door. The girls hide in the guys truck when he stops to gas up and look through the porn stash to find items inside like the anal invader. I guess thats enough of the plot to scare most people away. Plot aside the sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy attempts at symbolism like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruit during the scene where the slutty sister meets the main character for the first time or how the camera lingers way too long on certain shots to try to convey a message.<br /><br />If you ever see this for sale or rent or whatever stay away. Its not worth the money in either case.',neg
'The New Twenty is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Yes some may argue that formulaic small budget films that strive for less may seem worse but I would argue that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formulaic indie film that pretends to be more is worse. <br /><br />The New Twenty was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson and I will never get back the 91 minutes of my life that I wasted on his film.<br /><br />THE SCREENPLAY & CHARACTERS<br /><br />From beginning to end the screenplay failed to provide an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would want to see succeed or fail. <br /><br />In story telling the three dramatic conflicts are man vs. man man vs. the world and man vs. himself. <br /><br />The screenplay focuses on a group of college friends in New York and is preoccupied with the dynamic of man vs. himself where each of the films characters are so self-absorbed in a stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the movie atrophies before the audiences very eyes. <br /><br />Each of the main characters indulge in unexplained bad behavior (heroin addiction with no history as to why the character is an addict; a fiancée who has sex with her fiancées boss/investor even though the character is written too smart to have sex with such a sleazy character; a man who begins as a decent guy but is attracted to a foul-mouthed investor and converts for some unknown reason into a similar foul-mouthed business jackass; a closeted chubby gay cyber geek who does nothing but find dates online; and a gay Asian man who dates an HIV positive older man but has no scenes establishing why the relationship works and why love develops).<br /><br />Crucial scenes establishing the cause of the characters addiction the suffering and self- loathing of the fiancée that might explain why she would sleep with a sleaze bag; the back story that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a Gordon Gecko type character and become a jackass; a story line for the chubby cyber geek; and more scenes of interaction between the Asian man and HIV positive boyfriend are all missing.<br /><br />Without proper establishing details all of the characters actions seem forced and contrived.<br /><br />DIRECTION CINEMATOGRAPHY & SCORE<br /><br />I found Mr. Johnsons direction to be without a clear point of view leaving the actors emotionally incoherent. <br /><br />The cinematography can be described as mundane at best. Mr. Johnson selected small spaces to shoot and failed to catch the grandeur of New York City. This failure created a claustrophobic film that viewed like the filming of a stage play and not a film.<br /><br />The score was embarrassingly absent from most of the film. I assume that Mr. Johnson is to blame since he could have asked for full score to enhance understanding in each shot.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />The New Twenty is an annoying and unmitigated failure in film-making.',neg
'SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />Not really a very good movie... but I did like the idea behind it... and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with. The movie is ostensibly an episode of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off danger zone and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them. The survivor if there is one wins fame and fortune... everyone else just winds up dead. The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad. None of the real people seem real at all. The actors playing the killers are kind of fun... because they are portraying cheesy and over-the-top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types... and thats exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show. The movie pretends to be done all in one take... there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the danger zone and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera... but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly (to hide the cuts from one take to another I would imagine).',neg

'This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone ever made. This is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself. First Blood Pt. 2 is very similar to Schwarzeneggers Commando but there you have Arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys. This movie is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. True this was the peak of the Cold War but Im sick of having Communists or the Nazis always being shown as the enemy. There are so many American movies that have this one thing in common. Why cant there a movie that show Americans as the enemy? Whos going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think that something like this would have really happened? By the looks of it an average brain washed American viewer certainly would.',neg
'I first read Pearl S Bucks splendid novel in my ninth grade history class and I enjoyed every thrilling page of it. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would get hold of it and considering that it was made in 1937 the results are excellent.<br /><br />Certain things have to be accepted: in 1937 there was no question of casting Asian actors in a major Hollywood film. In a way this renders the end product rather more interesting than if they had been able to use a more authentic-looking cast.<br /><br />With that obstacle to overcome executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) took the trouble to hand-pick a splendid and stellar cast. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was at the peak of his powers as an actor during this period and could very nearly play anything he put his mind to. Once you get past the makeup (its good but no one is going to really mistake him for a Chinese man) his performance has all the verisimilitude of his best work.<br /><br />Then there is Luise Rainer. Coming off an Oscar win the previous year for her performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD the Viennese actresss star was on the rise and she was given the plum role of O-lan despite her lack of experience in Hollywood. Her performance won her a second consecutive Oscar the first time in history that happened.<br /><br />Much criticism has been leveled at Rainers performance and her Oscar win here. She has been called wooden and one-note. There is a small grain of truth in that. HOWEVER that being said all you need to do is go back to the book. For Rainer though not Chinese played O-lan pretty much as Buck wrote her; it is in fact a splendid performance and one of the best transfers from book to screen I have ever witnessed.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast well this was MGM. They had the biggest roster of stars and character actors in Hollywood at the time and a big budget to pay for the best and in the end they got the best.<br /><br />The film softens Wang Lungs marriage to O-lan somewhat. In the novel with wealth come the lusts of the flesh and he takes on a concubine a move which devastates his wife but her feelings as a mere woman do not concern him. In the film a contrite Wang Lung returns to his wife on her deathbed the two pearls he had taken from her years before realizing too late that she was his true love.<br /><br />Corny yes. But thats Hollywood. Considering the obstacles they were up against the film might well have opened to screams of laughter. But despite the noticeable dearth of real Asians in the cast this film has worn surprisingly well with the passage of seventy-three years. In fact the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is when it might so easily have been a disaster.',pos
'..especially by Lambert. This is the essential Burroughs Tarzan that I grew up reading when I was a kid. I have read a few negative reviews on this film and couldnt help but wonder what their issue was. They obviously didnt see the movie I did or they were expecting something that was more akin to the Saturday afternoon serials.<br /><br />This was the Tarzan that was of the novel and the film makers should be applauded for tackling the source material and taking it seriously. Lambert was excellent. I still think he is one of Hollywoods most under-rated actors. This was a movie that he shines in.<br /><br />The photography and the apes done by Rick Baker both were amazing. You definitely felt the since of the jungle. The 2nd half Tarzans attempt at being civilized really pulls you into the emotional conflict he had was forced to resolve.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film',pos
'If this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj) then I am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards.<br /><br />If you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of Anil Akshay Saif and Kareena then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film. The film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. He has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations.<br /><br />The first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film. That itself was a clear indicator of the directors vision. Every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted. Anil Kapoors gimmick of attempting good English falls flat most of the times. And Saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie.<br /><br />In short ITS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURSES AFTER JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM. I would say that even Aaja Nachle was a better enjoyable movie than this.<br /><br />One cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved. The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshays love story. After the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music. Vishal Shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song. The songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically. Only one song Falak Tak Chal is somehow good of all in the lot. An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar.<br /><br />Regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this : Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign Location (probably Ladakh). In the next scene they are searching for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the dicky of their car. I am still thinking who wrote this.<br /><br />If you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts. You can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are GOD. Are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved? So no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan.<br /><br />Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar If possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out. As artists of such stature you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers. People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively. I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie the actors and the production house both.',neg

'I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Based on a novella by science- fiction author Brian Aldiss this film attempts to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band.<br /><br />Almost deliberately gimmicky the film is also too clever by half (if youll pardon the pun). By mixing genres styles and moods the directors (whose previous film was the excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha) lose their way pretty quickly. I was never sure whether I was meant to take it all seriously or not. Flashbacks dream sequences it was all just a bit much. Plus the promised rock and roll just didnt move me. I was reminded a bit too much at times of Hedwig and the Angry Inch a film I found original and moving. But in this case the songs just werent as good nor were the main characters sympathetic. A more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing Velvet Goldmine.',neg
'We were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here. Well we got it home and could not believe what we saw. Its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor. The main character is all over the place... one moment he is like an immature little kid the next moment he is mature and intelligent then heroic then a perverted stalker.<br /><br />The worst part is all of the out of place sexual content. I have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy but this is just presented in a way that is creepy. Nipple slips close ups of a girls crotch (many times) in white panties or a swimsuit. It was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters. <br /><br />We were expecting something of a mature nature but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was... besides jiggling cartoon boobs and poor dialogue. If you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and crotchs... this is for you. If you are looking for something beyond that this movie was empty. The characters and dialogue were just plain irritating.<br /><br />',neg
'After watching the rather sloppy WW1 spy thriller Madam Lili (1969)starring Julie Andrews on tv this afternoon I suddenly thought I had seen a far superior WW1 spy thriller. All I could remember was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. It only took a short search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor. Once I recognised the title the memories came flooding back. It is for its time a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of Kitchener and the German offensives of 1918.It also has a female spy who is much more believable than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks. If you have an interest in war films and particularly WW1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity.',pos
'One of the best of the kitchen-sinks. Fantastic views of London and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60s. Loachs eye seems to capture everything yet makes no judgment - a taste of things to come. As with Kes Riff-raff and Sweet Sixteen it serves as a cinematic social history of Britain. Carol White is completely convincing you love her fancy her want to take care of her but hold your head at her self-destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope. Well backed up by Terence Stamp ( fresh off The collector also catch The Hit ) and a plethora of English faces ( all looking very young ). Pefectly set to Donovans dulcet tones. Stamp sings Yellow is the color in a lovely scene ending with him saying  Getting better aint I  ( song also used in The rules of Attraction - I think ) Watch Carol Whites screen mum getting ready to go out and get a bloke putting on her false eye-lashes to the sound of Rosie on the radio - priceless.

'The Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film production course! Its a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the movie and then listening to the writer/directors commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned but I think of movies as a means of communication and communication isnt complete if the audience doesnt know what the hell the director is talking about. The directors avowed purpose is to make a movie void of Hollywood conventions. Among those conventions alas is consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often dont understand points where he has purposely avoided a Hollywood cliché. However he never seems to grasp the idea that clichés exist for a reason. They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. Its fine to avoid them but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise rich with potential. Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII. Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them. Someone with less disdain for the Hollywood convention of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. This film certainly isnt it! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular Im becoming increasingly impressed by Gonzo who plays the lively corpse. In a number of muppet films he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.',neg

I much prefer cartoons with Daffy and Bugs which are fifteen or so years before-hand.

Also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining jokes (some do not enhance the episode) ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre. The plot is mainly geared by jokes - each joke keeps the episode going.

A motorcycle gang known as The Savages whos led by tyrant Pigiron invade and finally take over the place. Stryker doesnt want to get involved but that changes when he friends become the actual targets.<br /><br />Is there anything good to say about this scuzzy item? Tough call as the only fundamental reason to watch this low-budget car wreck is for the tremendous b-cast the crew managed to get hold off for this project. While I dont think its a complete botch job its not terribly good either. Now what a cast! Lance Henriksen (being the main character he strangely doesnt have top billing but the final one) Karen Black George Kennedy Richard Lynch Bill Forsythe Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. Now what went wrong with this scummy low-budget bungle. The shallowness of the material is too one-dimensional that it heavily borrows ideas from better movies (namely Mad Max) and comes up with a complete mess of ideas that just dont gel and could have been better thought out. The clichés that are used can be manipulated into a good viewing despite being predictable but Savage Dawn seems to let it skimpily rush all by without letting the viewer soak it all up. The cast are mostly wasted in nothing roles. A bleached-blonde Henriksen is capably solid and even with his commending presence that provides an enigmatic glow to his character. He doesnt get up to hell of a lot and sometimes goes missing in action. Too much sideline action but when he did kick some bikers ass the good times flowed. Karen Blacks hissing performance is a very odd one and is all about the screaming and cursing. Although she does get into one memorable catfight with Claudia Udys flirtatious vixen character Katie. A wheelchair bound George Kennedy roams around aimlessly until the final assault and Richard Lynch looks embarrassed as a wayward priest / town mayor in a very redundant role. An on edge Bill Forsythe simply chews it up as the head honcho of the notorious biker pack.<br /><br />The junky story (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) has that cheesy comic book getup and very much is influenced by the western genre. Just look at the villains for that. How they came up with their names is mystery. Maybe they drew them out of a hat. Its pretty second rate material that more often moves onto one lacklustre scene after another. Unfunny comical elements are chucked in and as well a bit of sleaze. Tacky exploitation that doesnt get gritty enough and the deaths are quite laughable. A clumsy script is filled convoluted details and unbearable trite. Simon Nuchterns spotty direction was by the numbers and tepidly laid out. One or two intense scenes cant makeup for its tortoise-like pacing and many cack-handed stunts. The cardboard sets had down n dirty look but lack that organic sense. The gravel-like cinematography by Gerald Feil was better handled when the main focus wasnt on the town but on the desolate backdrop (like the beginning and ending climax of the film) with some neat camera touches. Pino Donaggios clunky music choices are drowned out by its own incompetence.<br /><br />Savage Dawn is a forgettable quickie midnight movie thats a definite misfire for most part. There are better and more convincing exercises of the same ilk out there.',neg

Ive NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED OR LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE.<br /><br />2. Paiges boyfriend Blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him (while hes on the ground) and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat.. then he dies.<br /><br />3.

Dead has nothing in common with the movie. Show this one to your girlfriend and shell skip the senior prom turning your life into a deserted ruin. Blah!!!',neg
'Ive avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy. Having been born too late to see Hair in its contemporary setting I have just been familiar with the UK and Broadway cast recordings for many years; and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little creaky but still great fun.<br /><br />The film. It drops some of the songs (The Bed My Conviction Frank Mills) and cuts others (Walking in Space). However what is left is presented very well indeed. All the singers and dancers are excellent and the key performers (especially Treat Williams as Berger Beverley DAngelo as Sheila John Savage as Claude) are memorable.<br /><br />As a hippy celebration and anthem Hair manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late. It was no longer the era of peace love and Biba but the time of punk rock ... although watching this film now in the time of Iraqi problems gives a new resonance to the Vietnam issues of the 1960s.<br /><br />Milos Forman who also made Amadeus did a good job on directing. In its scope and feel it reminds me of Norman Jewisons Jesus Christ Superstar especially with the joy of the Aquarius scene and the intimacy of Easy To Be Hard.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era.',pos
'Ive long heard that to get their start in legitimate films many behind-the-camera types work on porno films.<br /><br />The people who produced and directed this monstrosity stayed too long.<br /><br />Poorly paced staged and written it uses a lot of perfectly good talent (Diehl Dorn Eggert) badly.<br /><br />Much sexual activity is teasingly implied here by the brassiere-popping host to the alien creature but it never crosses the line...<br /><br />Youll still want to shower afterwards though.',neg
'Ice Age is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the companys first. We are introduced to the main characters: a squirrel named Scrat (voiced by Chris Wedge AND PLEASE NOTE: the sound of Scrats screams is the sound of Toms screams from the Tom and Jerry cartoons) a woolly mammoth named Manny (voiced by Ray Romano of Everybody Loves Raymond) a sloth named Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo of Titan A. E.) and a saber toothed tiger named Diego (voiced by Denis Leary of Pixars A Bugs Life).<br /><br />The movie opens with Scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that he caused an avalanche. We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age (except for Manny who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him). Sid comes out of his cave yawning and saw that his family abandoned him. He then pays toll with some aardvarks. Unfortunately he gets pursued by Sylvia (voiced by Kirsten Johnston of 3rd Rock from the Sun) a female orange sloth who wants Sid to go migrating with her. Sid eventually teams up with Manny and they became friends.<br /><br />Meanwhile nearby a human tribe Soto (voiced by Goran Visnjic) an evil saber toothed tiger wants revenge against the tribes leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son Roshan away from him. In the morning he Diego and Sotos henchmen Lenny (voiced by Alan Tudyk) Oscar (voiced by Diedrich Bader) and Zeke (voiced by Jack Black) attacked the tribe but the leaders wife escaped with Roshan and gave him to Manny and Sid to look after. Eventually Diego joins them and went on a journey to return Roshan back to his tribe who are also looking for him as well. Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out okay? Besides Manny Sid Diego Scrat Sylvia and Roshan the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that Roshans tribe are using and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named Jennifer (voiced by Jane Krakowski) and a skinny female yellow sloth named Rachel (voiced by Lorri Bagley) to whom Sid shows them Roshan as they relax in a tar pit. Incidentally the two rhinos Carl (voiced by Cedric The Entertainer of PDIs Madagascar) and Frank (voiced by Stephen Root of Pixars Finding Nemo) who go after Sid for ruining their meal and confront Manny on a cliff are simple minor characters. Same went for the dodos who are using melons as their food supply.<br /><br />The gags in this movie are very funny. For instance Manny talks through his trunk saying IM NOT GOING! When Jennifer and Rachel are out of the tar pit Sid asks Jennifer What do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens? Jennifer then responds to him What do you say if you go jump into the TAR PIT!? Rachel also then kicks Sid in the waist. Sylvia sees Diego holding Sid by the neck with his teeth then she asks Sid if hes holding his breath tells Diego to eat him and promptly walks off.<br /><br />Since Ice Age is not only a success but it has 2 sequels: the first one was Ice Age: The Meltdown which was released in 2006 and the other was Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs which is going to be releasing next year. I can hardly die waiting to see what Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs will be like.',pos
'This movie was Flippin Awful....I wanted those hours of my life back. For gods sake -stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs. Its not worth mentioning the title but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this. And where do I begin? The dumb A** kids in the movie.....The zero plot or story?...the garden-variety college/frat boy-esquire scenes of towel slapping? Or the VERY bad acted teen angst innuendo? $$$#@\%@! My god It NEVER ended!.....I remember thinking I would have rather kissed the movie theater floor then sit through this one again.<br /><br />But what do you expect? Most people with the brain power to look up reviews are not going to be the target audience here at all- so GO SEE Pirites 2 again or the Jet Lee one -If your debating to yourself. Look This movie will just cost you your soul your money your energy and your brain cells. HEED THE WARNING.',neg
'Like last year I didnt manage to sit through the whole thing. Okay so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging. Or rather out of all the total bores packed into the theatre he at least wasnt in the Top 10 Most Boring. A lot of the presenters on the other hand were in this coveted Top 10. I hadnt known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portmanif theres no director shes gone). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Boring Speeches was long and tedious Beyonce Knowles butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Presenter award.<br /><br />For helping me write this review Id like to thank my Mum my Dad my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me and Id like to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I havent been starving myself for a month.

'Dutiful wife Norma Shearer (as Katherine Kitty Brown) waits on husband Rod La Rocque (as Bob Brown) hand and foot. While making him breakfast in bed and helping him dress for a Sunday golf outing Ms. Shearer suggests joining Mr. La Rocque for the day noting how infrequently the two see each other. But La Rocque puts her off saying her presence adversely affects his game. Then unexpectedly Shearer meets the real reason for her husbands frequent absences his pretty blonde mistress!<br /><br />Three years later Shearer is a glamorous and flirty divorcée. While summering in Paris she has struck up a friendship with wealthy older socialite Marie Dressler (as as Mrs. Boucci Bouccicault). Ms. Dressler invites Shearer to her Long Island home to socialize with some friends and ask a favor. Dressler is worried about her granddaughters relationship with a suave worldly man. She wants young Sally Eilers (as Dionne) to marry Raymond Hackett (as Bruce) instead. Aware of Shearers flirtatious conquests Dressler asks her to lure the undesirable man away from Ms. Eilers. Shearer is stunned to discover the man is La Rocque her ex-husband.<br /><br />Shearer and Dressler make this a cute entertaining play. They are in top form giving guaranteed-to-be-popular performances with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is silly and predictable; yet in a way which helps the humorous situation. And the ending is quite clever. In fact the comic Let Us be Gay may have aged better than Shearers larger-produced and more serious The Divorcée which was released around the same time. The cast uniformly fine. La Rocque is better than his film with Lilian Gish; but his role is not at all endearing. Gilbert Emery (as Towney) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) are funny supporting suitors.<br /><br />Those not familiar with Norma Shearer may not realize it is she who appears as the dowdy wife in the opening scenes. This is Shearer as Kitty before her make-over. Watch the close-ups of Shearer with light natural make-up for a good look at an intriguingly beautiful woman.<br /><br />******* Let Us Be Gay (1930) Robert Z.

'This film reeks of production line planning. It appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies and threw spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Baby! Airplane! - ROLL EM! - The film does address the age of the Stewart/Allyson performers; though Im certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger.<br /><br />There are messages in Strategic Air Command I found curiously shocking and offensive but Ill stick with one truly wretched element: The happily married couple is challenged when Mr. Stewarts character makes an important decision without consulting his wife. In the films most dramatic scene she calls him on it. It ends completely unresolved - Allyson is crying her heart out on their bed and Stewart walks out on her. NO discussion; he simply says he is correct and walks out on his devastated wife. For all he knows she could slit her wrists.<br /><br />Later Allyson apologizes for questioning her husbands decision.<br /><br />Unbelievable! <br /><br />Stick with Stewart-Allyson in The Stratton Story (1949). <br /><br />** Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Mann ~ James Stewart June Allyson Frank Lovejoy',neg
'Once you can get over Nic Cage playing an Italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love not war you can get down to enjoying this beautiful-looking film. This could be used as an advert for tourism in the Mediterranean. John Hurt is great and Penelope Cruz isnt bad as you might expect. Christian Bales character is somewhat one-dimensional which is a shame.<br /><br />The main drawback of this film is the adaptation from the book - having been told subsequently the differences between the book and film plots I feel cheated out of a much better and more convincing storyline.',pos
'This short a formative cartoon featuring Pepe Le Pew concerns a cat who thinks hell solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk. Trouble is he attracts the most unwelcome attention of an honest and for truly skunk (our hero Pepe entering stage left) being decidedly more attentive shall we say than M. Cat would like. Every great plan has its drawbacks but this ones a corker! I wonder if Jack Warner got a call from the Hays Office over the fact that Pepe and the object of his adoration were both male. After all Betty Boop was in part responsible for the Production Code coming into existance. Subsequent conquests were clearly and most definitely female. Very good cartoon but Pepe is a character who works better as the focal point rather than supporting. Well worth watching. Recommended.',pos
'Bluff has been showing for a good few months at movie theatres in Bogota and today I finally got round to seeing it. I didnt really know what to expect at all but was very happily surprised. It is a crime comedy of the same ilk as Snatch etc and it manages to nicely balance elements of suspense with comedy. The style of the film is established early on with cheerful music and the Argentinean narrator who makes asides direct to camera -- odd the first time but subsequently fitting naturally.<br /><br />With my less-than-perfect Spanish I still found the plot and dialogue easy enough to follow and plenty of the comedy is situational. My Colombian girlfriend was laughing a lot at the various portrayals of people from different regions and social classes which did pass me by somewhat but for instance a well-acted portrayal of a pompous idiot in a position of power is funny in any language.<br /><br />I think it is to this films credit that it has something of a global flavour: I wasnt often reminded that this was Colombia that I was watching. Yet it is important to note that many wealthy Bogotanos do live like some of the characters in this film and it is not a mis-portrayal of Bogota or Colombian society in any way just a *selective* portrayal -- as is any film supposedly portraying a real situation/culture.<br /><br />I dont know how much of the comedy would be lost in subtitles but if it comes to your country definitely go check it out: it is a very slick and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humour. And all in a tightly packaged 90 minutes.',pos
'The MTV sci-fi animated series Æon Flux is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna 400 hundred years into the future. For her latest mission she has been sent to kill the citys leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) but she uncovers secrets along the way.<br /><br />Aeon Flux falls under the category of good premise mediocre execution. Interesting story yet the film was a little dull. A lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and thats not true at all. It may be a disappointing film but its an average film at best. I have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so I cant compare the two. Its probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. The film is not that confusing but its easy to get lost if youre not familiar with the material. The acting was alright nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast also give decent performances including Jonny Lee Miller Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including Sithandra Aeons friend.<br /><br />The problem with Aeon Flux is that it takes itself too seriously. It carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little tiring. Theres no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the film is so serious the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are pretty good but thats not what the film is really about so dont go in expecting just an action movie. The twist at the end isnt mind blowing but its still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting. The visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice. So the movie may be a case of style over substance. Interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time. In the end its not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental. Rating 4/10',neg
'on this quagmire of mediocrity? You are SO much better than this.<br /><br />Simply put Frostbite is worthless. Bad acting (and I use that term loosely) minimalist plot sophomoric humor and lackluster snowboarding. Theres not even a sufficient display of feminine pulchritude to spark the prurient interest of socially inept but red-blooded males.<br /><br />Top Gun had spectacular flight sequences to goggle at. Days of Thunder had heart-pounding racing action. Even Point Break had skydiving scenes to its credit. Frostbite has none of these. Its not worth your time my time Traci Lords time Carmen Nicoles time nor the time of anyone involved with this destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly usable on something worthwhile had it not been wasted on this fodder for the recycling center.<br /><br />The world will be a better place when we forget that Frostbite ever existed.',neg
'Literally every aspect of this science-fiction low-budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors contemporaries and those to follow. Bad special effects a weak storyline ridiculous amounts of blood and gore annoying and pointless characters all that you can expect. Attack of the Sabretooth is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering Smilodon cats for an attraction. The cats escape and begin to kill people the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats.<br /><br />Special effects-wise the film is about an average achievement given its budget. The sabretooths are portrayed through poor CGI. Amazingly though the cats look more realistic in an up-close detailed shot rather than the longer more distant shots where the CGI is better concealed. Their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful. Just as youd expect they attack rip off some arms and legs and leave very little behind. This is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock.<br /><br />The plot and characters are just as horrendous. We have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt. And take it very VERY seriously. Even so much as to trespass on private property tamper with security systems and steal. Why are they taking a simple game so seriously? Did I miss something? Was there money involved? Or were they sent to do it? I dont know I could barely follow the film. But it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it. Even so they went too far for normal.<br /><br />Attack of the Sabretooth is a very poor film. Even for a low-budget sci-fi flick it is a very poor and cheap example. It will bore most viewers to tears might be attractive for some and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through. And keep in mind this is not a comedy this is a cheap horror flick so its not suppose to be comical.',neg
'I saw this on the big screen and was encapsulated with it. The period of Queen Victorias younger years are a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl was thrusted into one of the highest roles in the world.<br /><br />The script is perfect the acting is amazing the history and attention to detail is out of this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. Funny how her mother is played by Elizabeth the 1st and William IV is played by Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder).<br /><br />This portrayal of Victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman once - Im sure she would have been on Jeremey Kyle Show if it had been around then: My mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life.<br /><br />A Perfect piece of a major part of British and Commonwealth history.',pos
'This is a truly awful film. Lou Diamond Phillips simply calls this one in. The use of miniature models of the train are laughable. The plot seems to develop on the run (there is an alien on board; oh and an eco-terrorist is on board too; oh and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control; oh and the train is going to run into another train one hour ahead; oh and that train has nuclear waste on it...).

The story never gets interesting and you feel helpless as you watch.<br /><br />Usually Id score bore flicks like this one low but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more points.',neg
'What were given in this trying-to-be trendy film is a frat-pack of college friends now approaching age 30 (which we all know of course their generation thinks of as the new 20). Consisting of four guys and a gal we have thrust at us the following types: seemingly unemployeds and frequent drug users along with one individual who is job successful and one who is trying-to-be. They are all in their own way drifting while trying to find both a future and emotional happiness. With one possibly two exceptions these are people this reviewer would definitely never care to come close to modeling myself after. There is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives. Except in the instance of one individual (who appears on the way to finding it) none appears headed toward emotional satisfaction in his/her life. And so about the only sincere moment in this film is when a knock at the door brings to the person answering it an unexpected and heartfelt I love you.<br /><br />With only the exceptions mentioned these people are the kind hardly deserving or worthy of several hundred thousands of dollars being thrown away in presenting their stories.<br /><br />PS--Writer/director Johnson definitely appears to have a problem with showing gay sexual scenes----with no such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexual ones. Why might that be?<br /><br />****',neg
'A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident. When the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live. The decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.<br /><br />This comes to us from director Rob Schmidt who made Wrong Turn (a film I have not seen). With only one horror film under his belt and not a particularly notorious one at that I was a bit reluctant to watch this episode expecting Schmidt to be a Master of Horror in only the most liberal sense. My apologies to him for my underestimation. As of episode 10 in a 13 episode season this was actually the best one yet.<br /><br />The issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device. However this is only the foundation on which the story revolves. Once the horror elements show up the film goes from decent to spectacular. Great acting great plot great dialogue great suspense. I was a little creeped out at times (which is good) and most of all: the gore is in extreme abundance! I read a review of this episode prior to watching it where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of Hellraiser in this. Through the first part of the show I had no idea what they were talking about. Then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of Hellraiser 2. However I in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film. I can see no other way to create the effect that was created and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than Hellraiser 2.<br /><br />Some plot twists show up later on and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look. I didnt watch it a second time but I think the beginning would make more sense if I had (not that its confusing). The subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice and I found myself going back and forth about whether I disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if I felt bad for him. Hes somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story if you will. I feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist but hes completely unlovable.<br /><br />While the Stuart Gordon episode may be better and Im excited about the Washingtonians episode I think I could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine. When legends like John Carpenter let me down (again) I get a bit worried about the genres future but then a fresh face like Rob Schmidt comes along and gives me hope. This one is a keeper and please bring Schmidt back for season 3!',pos
'I found this to be an entertaining account of the challenges an independent film maker might encounter (something I never even thought about). The film managed to keep my interest the entire time and I actually laughed out loud more than once! Im not a film maker so I know nothing about the technology but I though it was well edited and flowed smoothly telling the story. As a disclaimer I contributed to this effort after the fact providing music for the soundtrack but I was not involved in the creation of this film and I could not tell you a thing about Repo Man except that I remembered seeing it way back when (Im not really a sci-fi fiend).

'In the eighties Savage Steve Holland put out three movies two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre absurdist teen comedies. The third How I Got Into College does not measure up to Better Off Dead and this one mainly because of its lack of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (Except for a tiny cameo).<br /><br />One Crazy Summer is an underrated movie with lots of great characterizations and gags. As I recall Savage Steves movies were vilified as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he drifted into childrens TV. We could use more movies from the likes of him.',pos
'First lets call this movie what it is:<br /><br />1. Its a feel-good movie with a message.<br /><br />2. The acting is just okay dialog slightly better production value pretty good.<br /><br />3. Rugby scenes...just barely passable.<br /><br />But heres the trick: this isnt something Hollywood contrived and it isnt trying to be a ferociously accurate portrayal of the sport. It is instead a pretty good representation of mostly real people in real circumstances and a real storyline. Sure they could have done a better job actually reping the sport but my vote: it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do.<br /><br />(And fwiw I cant think of many football baseball hockey or soccer movies that are true to the sport either. Cmon...Bull Durham?)<br /><br />Im not a rugby player (I was a wrestler) but I graduated from Highland attended 86-90 and occasionally trained with the Rugby guys. My brother-in-law David however was one of the original founding members of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His younger brother Billy played the next year as I recall. If youre interested theres a Highland Rugby site at highlandrugby.net that addresses the history of the team.) <br /><br />By the time I was there the club had been in existence for about a decade and had long since built a reputation for excellence. Its a fact that they focused on broad training topics: devotion honor discipline effort not tactics. I thought the rugby guys I knew were a little off in the head but I think I might have just been a little jealous. They were hard-core dedicated to the belief system that Gelwix promoted.<br /><br />With regard to the cultural mixing issues that have been brought up it might be interesting to note that while I was there in the 80s one of the larger schools in the city was shut down - South High School - and its students distributed among the other 3 primary SLC schools. To be honest Highland pre-80s was pretty whitebread...Ive got a picture of the team from (I think) 1977 that shows an *all* white club. South High on the other hand was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: I had a pair of friends from South who joined the team one Tongan one Samoan and as I recall there were a bunch of Island-nation players that joined up 88-90. I dont think anyone questioned the credibility of the team in adopting Maori (or other cultural) traditions: if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys its that they walked the walk. <br /><br />And as to the strength of the team when compared to the best highschool-age teams in the world: yeah its true that US-Rugby on average when taken as a whole does not represent particularly well against the best elsewhere. There are exceptions but hey - its a simple fact that Rugby doesnt have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the US that arise in other countries.<br /><br />With that said judge Highland on its merits: <br /><br />- the *only* team to qualify for the USA Rugby National Championships every year of that organizations 25-yr history.<br /><br />- a win record of 392 wins 9 losses. Read that again...winningest coach in any US sport in history.<br /><br />- regular international tours. <br /><br />- some compelling wins against some legitimate international teams.<br /><br />Are they the world best? Maybe some years probably not most...but theyre pretty good on a consistent basis. And its disrespectful to the game to blow them off when Highland Rugby may be the best ambassador to the sport in the US.',pos

'To suggest Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre could also use some therapy is putting it mildly. In Dig! which won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance we watch him and his band self-sabotage over seven years while ex-friends and contemporaries The Dandy Warhols rise to comparative greatness (a mobile phone advert anyway).<br /><br />What elevates Dig! above its contemporaries is the immense near-biblical comic-tragedy being played out: a depressingly honest treatise on art versus commerce and compromise. For all his look at me Im a bloody genius posturing Newcombe is in fact revealed to be a singularly gifted if immensely troubled musician - far more talented than his rival the Dandys Courtney Taylor who narrates the picture. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper Taylors Peter Fonda.<br /><br />Even sadder Taylor appears to realise this evinced by his weary self-loathing voice-over: he knows his band won the battle - but at what cost? In truth they sold out made Indie-Lite records kept their teeth nice and clean and probably brushed their hair twice before bedtime - thus winning record contracts and a large tour bus. And jettisoning all credibility in the process. Newcombe on the other hand lives in filth is continually busted beats up fellow band members on stage kicks hecklers in the head - and is last glimpsed in Dig! being ferried away by police having lost the right to see his child.<br /><br />Two of the best films about rocks subculture have been directed by women: Penelope Spheeriss The Decline Of Western Civilization and this one  an instant classic the moment it was released.',pos
'The Rookie is based on the true story of a 40+ year old school teacher in Big Lake Texas reaching the majors. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small-town high school science teacher and baseball coach. His team is losing terribly until the team discovers that their coach played in minor leagues and can throw a pitch 98 mph. <br /><br />After throwing batting practice and a wager is made Jim agrees that if his team wins regionals hell try out for the Major Leagues. The movie tells the story from Jimmy being boy to playing in his first game in the majors. It is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the movie worth while giving an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent supporting cast which includes: Brian Cox Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /><br />The story takes a little while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow but it all works in well by the end. The baseball scenes are fun well-filmed and portrayed excellently. The movie really isnt about baseball but about one mans quest to reach his dream. Its inspiring its emotional and its funny. I liked it I hope you do.<br /><br />The Rookie. Starring: Dennis Quaid Brian Cox Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones.<br /><br />4 out of 5 Stars.',pos
'Huge exhaustive and passionate summary of American cinema as seen through the eyes of Martin Scorcese. Needless to say there is never a dull moment in all of its 4 hour running time. Many genres periods and directors are all examined discussed more from the perspective of cinephile rather than contemporary director. For anyone even remotely interested in American films or cinema in general. A masterpiece and the best of the BFIs Century of Cinema series.<br /><br />',pos
'Being a long-time Steve Martin fan it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliched script. The screenwriter must have just rented some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there - it certainly is about the least imaginative movie Ive seen in a long time - I knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it began. The African-American stereotypes and slave references are pretty offensive as well. But the thing that was the worst for me was to see Martin in a movie without a trace of wit. He probably is one of the most intelligent actors and here he totally sold out to a totally dumbed down script. He must be behind in his alimony to be in such a lame effort.',neg
'As if there werent enough of those floating around at the time already we have here another lame GODFATHER clone from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) which I had watched earlier this year. The marquee-value name roped in this time is Telly Savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of French painters! Apart from not looking minimally Sicilian he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl. Antonio Sabato then makes for an unlikely gangster - apart from being a resistible leading man; his relationship with Savalas which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye is also unconvincing (especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latters spirited teenage niece)! Besides for a gangster flick theres precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable (though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled); furthermore the score by Francesco De Masi is serviceable but nothing else. Incidentally the bargain-basement DVD I rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members - or even the films title - is ever listed!',neg
'Got the chance to see this at a friends house today and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this ever bothered me anyway since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who Blakes 7 and Dark Star. Hell even Outland wasnt a big budget affair so whilst money helps it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good.<br /><br />The story is straightforward at first with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then discover the prisoner has made it too hes a stone cold nut case and thats only the start of their problems.<br /><br />The effects except for the gunfights are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. Computer effects look a bit dodgy at times but serve their purpose well and add to the story lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. Films like I Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot like all too many of Hollywoods offerings.<br /><br />Whilst none of the actors get Oscar material its tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesnt outstay its welcome. The characters dont get fleshed out much but then they didnt in Predator either which it resembles in feel. Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn.<br /><br />Some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end but I like it. Unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained it is not so obscure that you cant get a handle on it at all and Id like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further.<br /><br />A cracking little film from an enterprising team done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. If this is what they can do on a shoestring Id like to see what they would do with a bit more cash and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics dont knock all the creativity out of them first.<br /><br />Recommended.',pos

'What an absolute pile of pants. Having read Chris Brookmyres books religiously since I came across Quite Ugly... I was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned.<br /><br />I obviously had too much faith. <br /><br />Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he doesnt quite fit. How anyone can read the book and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me.<br /><br />Entire characters are changed situations are dropped and to see Parlablanes dramatic break-in reduced to Nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window... it brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />I dread to think whats going to happen with Country Of The Blind if this is the benchmark...<br /><br />Please just avoid it...',neg
'For some reason I just didnt like it at all and felt embarrassed about how bad it was since I bought it and watched it with my family. All of us hated it with a passion. Its a nice enough kids movie maybe in the year it came out. However think about it: an outdated kids movie? Whats the point? Kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway and I dont see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all.<br /><br />Some kids movies (like Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed even now but Time Bandits is totally outdated. For your reference and I think applicable in this case I also did not like Dr Strangelove or Spinal Tap at all. So if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies you might like Time Bandits.<br /><br />There is also a horrible case of overacting as I recall from the bad guys. Think of the two stupid bad pirates in the Pirates of the C. movies except in Time Bandits they are not even remotely funny.<br /><br />Anyway I warned you thats all I can do. People that rate this movie high must have liked it from many years ago. If you have not seen it before then dont bother watching it now.',neg
'Valentine is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list (think Halloween Friday the 13th Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer). It certainly isnt as good as those movies that I have listed about but its better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first Friday the 13th film. One of those films was the 1981 Canadian made My Bloody Valentine which I hated alot. Valentine is a better film than that one but its not saying much. The plot: a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film. Then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up then theyre picked off one-by-one. The killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge. But is it him? Or could it be somebody else? Valentine has an attractive cast which includes Denise Richards David Boreanaz Marley Shelton Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material theyve got but a lackluster script doesnt really do them any justice. There are some scary moments throughout however. <br /><br />** (out of four)',neg
'Blood Legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer Tom Drake (Norman Bartold) to the Dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased Christopher Dean (John Carradine) upon his arrival he is greeted by Mr. Deans four children Gregory (Jeff Morrow) & his wife Laura (Merry Anders) Victoria (Faith Domergue) Johnny (Richard Davalos) plus Leslie (Brooke Mills) & her fella Carl Isenberg (John Smith). Drake plays a tape recording of theyre late Fathers wishes after his death the estate worth 136 million dollars is to be split equally between his four children if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest & if all were to die the freaky servants Elga (Ivy Bethune) Igor (Buck Kartalian) & the more mundanely named Frank (John Russell) would pocket the lot. Well not satisfied with a quarter share of $136 million (which is still almost $35 million back in 1971 which doesnt sound too bad to me) someone decides they want it all for themselves & its not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge...<br /><br />Co-written produced & directed by Roy Monson Blood Legacy disappointed me on two accounts. For starters this films alternate & much more common title is Legacy of Blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by Andy Milliagn back in 78 which Ive always wanted to see both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories & when I checked my on screen cable TV guide for Legacy of Blood I was excited because it said it was the Milligan film & even listed him as director so when I actually sat down to watch it & I heard John Carradines voice & I then knew it wasnt the Milligan film that I had wanted to see my heart sank. Then of course theres the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that Blood Legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times. The script by Monson & Eric Norden is slow boring & extremely predictable. The characters are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way the freak of a servant who asks his sister (?) to cane him the strange set of Brothers & Sisters who are just downright unlikeable & so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing & then theres the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first 10 minutes. Its boring to watch its poorly paced & its just a chore to even think about it. Please someone save me as this is really bad stuff. I could go on all day about how bad Blood Legacy is I really could.<br /><br />Director Monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he shouldnt have even been directing traffic. The entire film looks ugly its poorly photographed & there is no atmosphere or scares. The blood & gore is tame theres an axe in a head a decapitated head a scene when someone is stung to death by wasps & the best murder when someones face is eaten by piranha. However there are question marks over this scene so theres the victim right. Theres the tank of piranha right. Victims head is placed in piranha tank right. Pirahna eat victims face right. Water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten erm wheres the blood?<br /><br />Technically Blood Legacy is terrible it looks awful the sound was obviously shot live & its muffled & hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise. The acting was not going to win anyone any awards thats for sure the least said about it the better.<br /><br />Blood Legacy is an awful film there really isnt a single positive aspect to it or if there is I cant think of it. Do yourself a favour & dont bother with this one there are much better films out there.',neg

'One of the most nihilistic and brutal films Ive ever seen but also one of the most tragic and moving ones. This is an action-melodrama like the world has never seen it before. Sometimes the plot got me close to tears while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bone-crunching blow to the guts. Chilling performance by Edison Chen. The story of a HK-Cop and a Cambodian killer hunting each other down while bit by bit losing their humanity is a strong one. Featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera-work Dog bite Dog is pure HK-Bloodshed without the Heroism.',pos
'Designed only to annoy (or amuse) any self-respecting intelligent person. If the directors intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character then it would have been okay but I know that there is no such thing as a Hollywood director whod make a critique of Americas pro-Marxist 60s movement especially not a filmmaker from the 70s. There is so much idiotic dialog going on here that sometimes I wondered if I wasnt actually watching a comedy. You wouldnt be at fault for thinking that this is a satire  thats how naïve the movie appears. Spacek has been in her share of Leftist movies which brings me to the obvious inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those Hollywood liberal morons. But I mean arent they all? Nice boobs but s**t for brains.',neg
'Lonely among us definitely is one of the best first season episodes. The storyline although somewhat confusing creates a lot of suspense supported by the creepy synthesizer-driven soundtrack. This is a typically alien body invasion scenario but finally turning out to no evil purpose (the death of assistant chief engineer Singh to me was an accident). The two delegate species deliver an entertaining frame (best make-up so far) finally adding a little black humor to the series (the final scene). Patrick Stewart obviously enjoys stepping out a bit of his Picard character and exploring some new terrain as does Data by posing as Sherlock Holmes (another all time classic). The special effects are also convincing and director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first one trying to compensate Trois lack in acting ability by improving her looks. She does look beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress improves her appearance a lot. Picards lightning-scene on the bridge gives him a slight air of the emperor of Star Wars Return of the Jedi (which is a personal impression but made me smile).<br /><br />Theres also some playing with the lighting of the corridors (simulating night aboard) and the first moving camera pulling back from Picard when hes entering the transporter room to beam into the cloud... Nice work. The clever cutting creating continuing dialog through different scenes (Trois hypnosis report) rounds up the impression of a really well crafted TNG episode. The first one where even Wesley Crusher seemed almost tolerable... <br /><br />The ending however is a bit confusing just as if the producers were running out of time. P for Picard is a little far fetched and his return far too easy but that can be left aside regarding the many strong moments this episode has to offer...',pos
'Wesley Eure is young inventor Brian Foster whos invented a new crime busting security device in the form of a robot dog the titular C.H.O.M.P.S. (It stands for Canine HOMe Protection System). C.H.O.M.P.S. whos been modeled after Brians real dog Rascal can do just about anything; hes got enhanced speed strength X-ray vision and the like. Its just the thing to save his boss Ralph Nortons (Conrad Bain) security company. Naturally a slimy competitor Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants the edge so he tries to get his hands on the secret.<br /><br />This is the kind of thing thats just too hard to resist. Its got plenty of slapstick (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a great pair of bumbling idiots) an upbeat attitude an engaging cast and enough good laughs to keep one entertained. The energetic disco-style music gets repetitive but is undeniably catchy; the story is straightforward and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. In one thoroughly odd but side-splitting touch theres another dog in the film (named Monster) whose thoughts we actually get to hear; both his dialog and the performer doing the voice are priceless. In fact he even utilizes some mild profanity and his last words end the film on a positively gut busting final note.<br /><br />Eure and the cute Valerie Bertinelli are very likable young leads and their veteran supporting cast plays the material with all the gusto they can muster. Larry Bishop Hermione Baddeley Robert Q. Lewis and Regis Toomey also co-star.<br /><br />A rare theatrical live-action venture for the cartoon-creating team of Hanna & Barbera (The Flintstones Scooby-Doo The Smurfs and so on) C.H.O.M.P.S. is agreeably silly stuff.

'A reporter Craig Milford who works for The James Keller Public Telecommunication Center has an interview with a German professor of a Floridian university who made an unknown creature based upon some substance of meteor(s). But then a man named Anderson who is trying to control the whole planet with the creature and his man kill the professor and his assistants and plunder the creature. So Craig and his new female psychic partner Joanna Fitzgerald who can communicate not only with human being but also with alien friend(s) of the creature begin to find the creature and try to send it to an alien spaceship... This film has some great casts and staffs. For instance it has the actor David Warbeck of THE BEYOND the actress Laura Trotter of NIGHTMARE CITY the special visual effects creator Sergio Stivaletti of Dario Argentos masterpieces and the director (and also the story- writer) Alberto De Martino of THE MAN WITH ICY EYES and THE KILLER IS ON THE PHONE. And these talented people make an incredibly bad film named nothing but this MIAMI GOLEM which is essentially a confusedly combined film of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND with E.T.THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL. And this not-only-confused-but-also-crammed film has something worth; genetic engineering with psychical research. Consequently the film has at least one scientific and/or technical flaw; genetic engineering and psychical research are never compatible. (Strangely enough regarding this strangely childish combination of genetic engineering and psychical research the leading character Craig himself says THERE MUST BE A BETTER EXPLANATION to the short-haired psychic Joanna. But after all the whole story of the film doesnt and cant present any kind of BETTER EXPLANATION.) In addition this film has something more laughable; its problematic music. What the composer who is credited as Robert Marry provides is nothing but the strangely insistent BEVERLY-HILLS-COP-tasted music. I dont want to say this Italianised theme of BEVERLY HILLS COP per se is particularly bad music but I have to say it seems to be manifestly clear the music does not have the fitness for this film per se at all. Indeed just who can think BEVERLY HILLS COP has the compatibility with genetic engineering and/or psychical research?',neg
'are highlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland the villagers live the simple lives of fisher folk. My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery and the camera work on boats is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this pleasant film. Pickford was already a major star in 1917 and this film seems to have been written just for her: plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. Not a great Picford film but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother Owen Moore) is the love interest and is good as the strapping island lad. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldnt spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. Very effective.',pos
'With a minimal budget a running time of eight minutes and a great amount of imagination Nacho Vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts Ive ever seen.

'This movie is a ripoff of James Cains novel THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE. Apparently the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story--perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the Italians in WWII might account for their forgetting to consider royalties! Despite this the movie isnt really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie. In some ways its a lot better and in other ways it is definitely not.<br /><br />The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people. In fact the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking. The male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair (particularly on the back and shoulders) and his lady love is to put it frankly unattractive. They are a very very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version. And the ill-fated husband is really really obese and loves to walk around shirtless--and his counterpart in the American film Cecil Kellaway is definitely better looking (and probably better looking than the other two Italian leads actually). And this unattractiveness is generally a reason I actually preferred the Italian film--since I just could NOT imagine a finely coiffed dish like Lana Turner in the middle of nowhere married to Kellaway--I am 100\% sure she would have had dozens of better offers! Whereas the Italian wife frankly might NOT have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable.<br /><br />Part of the Italian films believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex. The sanitized American film tries to make you believe that although Turner and Garfield kill Kellaway they never actually get around to sex! This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic. In addition to the casual sexuality of the film its also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life--with lots of sweaty people a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath.<br /><br />The movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long American film. And what you get due to brevity isnt all good. The film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the American film--with grainier footage relatively poor orchestration and sets. It sure aint a pretty film but the Neo-Realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic. But it cannot make up for the short-cuts in the plot. Many of the plot elements in the later American version are either missing entirely or glossed over. And the ending seems a lot less interesting than the American film--and misses the entire human nature dilemma when Turner and Garfield turn on each other like rats (the best part of the American film).<br /><br />So which is the better film? Well a lot of this probably depends on you. As for me the Warner Brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic (though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles)--but it packed a great ending. And the Italian film was much much more realistic--until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed. So neither film is exactly great but Id give my nod to the Italian one being a bit better. Its too bad they couldnt have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film.',pos
'Painting is seeing then remembering better than you saw. So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman) the painter in The Light That Failed.The movie is in the grand old Hollywood style starring Ronald Colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes Ida Lupino in her first important role dependable character actor Dudley Digges (who also co-starred with Colman in Condemned.)and a solid performance by the wonderful actor Walter Huston.<br /><br />The title and opening sequences of the film pretty much give away the fact that Dick will lose his sight. Hes blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart Maisie (Muriel Angelus) are playing with a pistol. Later a wound while fighting in the Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter but hes already blinded by ambition and doesnt really reach his full potential until the point that his sight is leaving him. Enter bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino) and his self destruction is set in motion. Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays off Colman very well. Her evil tart reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage. <br /><br />Well acted and well directed this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.',pos
'If you want to see a great little horror comedy with an eerie feel to it this is the one. If you are expecting a blood and guts gore flick thats going to scare your pants off- then this isnt the one for you.<br /><br />For the budget that this movie was filmed on the music was particularly amazing! Even though the film was filmed on a bargain budget the music and audio was definitely better than most movies with a huge budget!<br /><br />The story was truly well done and the director is to be commended. There is an almost perfect blend of comedy to horror in this movie! The acting is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel which I am definitely holding out for! I have no doubt that this movie will become an instant cult classic.<br /><br />In a nutshell this movie chronicles the life story of a boy who enters into the career of becoming a grave-robber. It tells the story in flashback of each of the more fantastic experiences that the robber duo encounters. Vampires to Zombies and even aliens! Our stars start out as simple grave-robbers stealing for jewellery but quickly become body snatchers for a mad doctor (Angus Scrim) who requires bodies for his medical practise. When the duo find a way to have a vampire dispatch their cruel employer the grave-robbers discover that trafficking in undead corpses is much more profitable than just stealing regular dead bodies. The only problem is that there is another gang called the house of Murphy that is competing for the same undead corpses- and thats where both grave-robbing gangs clash head to head with dire consequences.<br /><br />This movie is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies that I have seen in years and reminds me of the Evil Dead. Dont miss this one you will regret it!',pos
'I have officially vomited in my own mouth thanks to this movie.<br /><br />I expected the absolute worst with this movie but I expected a heartwarming and pleasurable absolute worst. This is just terrible. Absolutely terrible. Terrible like Nazis spreading the black plague. Let me explain: Ewoks are speaking English. Its horrible.<br /><br />The villain girl looks like she travelled from the future set of Power Rangers. I really really want her to rise up from the ground and say At last!

'There are so many good things to say about this “B? movie.<br /><br />“B’ maybe in connections but not in commission. This is about the best of its genre that I have ever seen. A grade A effort by Universal. The script is well done imaginative and without fault. Writing credits: Howard Higgin original story & Douglas Hodges story John Colton (screenplay). Director Lambert Hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well. No skimping on the loads of extras and locations. I loved Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewarts mother in “It’s A Wonderful Life?. The fem lead Frances Drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her Karloff husband. Lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed. I think this is the best part I remember seeing him in. As I said there were so many good things: the African discovery of the Radium “X? the melting of the stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the Ten Little Indians in And Then There Were None (Agatha Christie) (the Barry Fitzgerald version)) the glowing of Karlof in the dark. Karloff’s mother played by Violet Kemble Cooper with elegance. And because of all these virtues I found myself believing in the science it portrayed.

'I dont know why they even kept the name. How they could call the series The Scarlet Pimpernel after they deviated from the novels so much I wouldnt have a clue. The character names are the only things they kept and even then they changed a few of those and mixed them up and changed Percys relationships with them. Admittedly I only watched about two hours at the most of it but that was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like Baroness Orzcy had portrayed her characters and probably would have been rolling around in her grave when it was filming and airing. Poor lady. I hope that when the next person wants to make a movie/series of the book they dont ruin it as completely as this series did.',neg

'Presque Rien is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Eschewing both stereotypes and preaching its a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place never melodramatic but often painfully real. If anything its almost too realistic as theres little in the way of conventional plot just scenes from a life. But the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn. Presque Rien might not be the most exciting film ever made; but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the pre-conceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme. Worth a watch.',pos

'The peculiar charisma of Martin Kosleck brings a certain believability to his character of the frustrated artist. He imbues his dialog with an odd sense of realism making the sculptor Marcel a convincing individual. The character manages to come across as a real person and not so much a typical B movie villain.<br /><br />The story line is nothing to write home about and many scenes are dull. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as the Creeper. Koslecks talkative philosophical character is contrasted with Hattons low key monosyllabic approach. The character of the Creeper isnt developed much beyond a basic monster level but Hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his back story.<br /><br />This movie was on Shock Theater a lot when I was a kid so I have a certain nostalgic fondness for it. Its worth seeing once anyway for those who enjoy Forties horror movies.',neg

'First of all I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest films I have ever seen. I have watched it almost 10 times just because Ive wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims. It has the captivating essence of a hand-held camera recording of a distant nephews seventh birthday. It has all the writing of a WWE match. And most of all it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. This movie is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three drunken teens in the desert. This scene convinced me that I was onto something big when I picked this film from the DVD rack (being drawn to the box because of the graphic of a velociraptor yelling the word RAPTOR on the front of it). The scene contains such treasures as tomato sauce spaghetti intestines vain attempts at humour and rubbery dinosaur puppets that repeat throughout the course of the movie. This movie is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The film contains erratic backdrops and prop use that causes ones mind to melt at the thought that someone could just have so little shame when it comes to creating a film. An example is when a truck in the middle of the night is parked beside a cliff wall. The very next day they find it in an open grassy area. The driver couldnt have driven it there since he had his face bitten off by an unnamed bipedal carnivore (I will explain why its unnamed in a second). So my only guess is that either the velociraptor drove it the livestock the driver was transporting did it or Jim Wynorski doesnt think very highly of his viewers. Hell in one part they expect me to believe that they are walking down a main street at night when the road doesnt have gutters the fire hydrant is precariously placed next to a phone booth and theres only a single street light. Yet still I feel compelled to watch and re-watch this film just so I can find more things that will make me giggle the next time I watch it. This film is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The directing on this film is horrific. Long extended pauses. Strange cuts to characters that werent even in the general vicinity of the conversation. People discussing things casually while facing the camera (and in turn making them face the wall). They cant even give the dinosaur a coherent species flipping between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor puppet (distinguished by the intensely long fat disproportionate claw). This film is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The editing is prominent on this film. This is not a good thing. I am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films masterfully crafted into a single piece of crap but there has to be a limit! Sub plots end as abruptly as they began. Explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters not being limited to well not being explained at all! And an ending that felt like driving a muscle car into a brick wall without a seat belt. You just never know what is going to happen because the film doesnt follow a coherent structure. This film is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Now Im going to just have to mention a single scene (the greatest one) that occurs near the end. This is a spoiler but not really. The final scene contains a showdown between tyrannosaurus rex and Sheriff Tanner. It is like the showdown between Sigourney Weaver and the Alien Queen in Aliens except without all the emotional power/budget/epic battling. It pretty consists of Tanner ramming the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery. A white bobcat. In a space of several minutes through a series of sneakily slipped in cuts the director manages to turn that white bobcat into a yellow forklift/crane looking piece of machinery. Now as I said I know that this film is made from scenes from other films but what two films warrant a showdown with a t-rex in a construction vehicle? This film is a masterpiece.<br /><br />This film gets a 1/10 for quality of film making but a 10/10 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy myself.',neg
'What a sad surprise.<br /><br />Being a die-hard fan of the original series (starring Don Adams) I was really looking forward to this. Poor fool me. This is sillier and more brain dead than a monkeys bottom.<br /><br />To say it was bad would be a severe understatement. It is/was the worst movie (well first 30 minutes of one) I have seen for a long time. I couldnt stand more than the first half hour preferring to watch my hard drive de-fragment.<br /><br />I can tolerate bad... bad is O.K. sometimes even cute. BUT up with contrived Hollywood crap (and this has to be the worst in many years) I will not put. This movie is a gross insult to the collective intelligence of humanity! My five year-old daughter could have written better - and she is not even dislexic!!! Im really tempted to try watching the rest of it but Im afraid I have better things to do... like making pizza dough and watching it rise.<br /><br />What a sad disappointment. No... Im buggered off! What a swindle! As Mel Brookes once said; Piece of shirt!',neg
'One True Thing is a very quiet film that opened in the fall of 1998 to glowing reviews but mild box-office. It tells the crippled story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger) a workaholic who is forced to move back home to take care of her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep) so that her aloof father (William Hurt) can run his academic department. These terms are only general. The strength of One True Thing lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above Hollywood cliché territory.<br /><br />Streep is Kate the perfect homemaker whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party celebrating Hurts birthday. But Ellen has never been close to her mother and since she graduated from Harvard University has a certain destain about her- Ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic air-head. While on the other hand she admires her father- who shares a special passion: Writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York firm and is almost heartbroken when her latest piece is torn down by Hurt who seems to be a very lonely figure.<br /><br />To get to the point as Kate gets sicker Ellens perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father. Hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most and Ellen assumes hes having an affair. Meanwhile shes given up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mothers cult group The Minnies and also learning that her mother isnt as weak as she first assumed.<br /><br />Without giving too much away One True Thing is a masterpiece in character study. Streep once again turns in a beautiful performance this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the vows of marriage. Streep earned her eleventh Oscar nomination for this performance. Hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that isnt revealed until the closing moments. But it is Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. Forget Chicago Cold Mountain Bridget Joness Diary or whatever else youve seen her do and rent this movie. She is remarkable in it. Working within her characters bitter resentment at understanding her parents Zellweger manages a realistic portrayal of a young woman fighting to keep her lip up while shes screaming inside.',pos
'Tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called Backstreet that tragedy is like another character in the film. The same could be said- and not withstanding bringing up Tarantino- for Sidney Lumets best work in years a melodrama where character is of the utmost concern not simply because of whats at stake with the cast involved. Kelly Masterson doesnt have a masterpiece of a script here (it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount) but her script does convey character before plot and in a story where the actions surround a heist its crucial to know who these people are beat by beat. Its bleak as hell unforgiving as Satan but also absolutely riveting 90\% of the time.<br /><br />Chalk it up not just because Lumet knows how to handle a non-linear script where we see the day-to-day actions of character to character before during and mostly after the botched mom-&-pop jewelry store robbery occurs but because of the formidable cast assembled (which I might add is Lumets specialty). Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke are brothers with their own respective financial f***-ups and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a fool-proof heist: looting their own mother and fathers jewelry store in Westchester. Hawkes Hank involves another shady character though murders occur and suddenly its tragedy on a Greek scale affecting the brothers and their father played by a perfect Albert Finney. Its the kind of material that most actors love- characters who like in Dog Day Afternoon are painfully human flawed to the bone but only wanting love &/or things to be set right and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needs.<br /><br />In this case though Hoffman and Hawke are matched splendidly; Hoffman has until the aforementioned last ten minutes a super-calm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally (i.e. with Finney or the car scene with Tomei) push his talents to the limit; Hawke meanwhile is called a loser by his ex-wife and daughter cant pay any debts at all and is called a baby by his own father and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter- hes not quite as flawed as his older brother but who wants to pick a straw for that title? And Finney as mentioned is spot-on all the way through making his turn in Big Fish look like childs play (the final scenes with him are terrifyingly tragic his face recoiling in a horror that has built up all through the second half).<br /><br />Also featuring supporting turns from a finely ditsy and perversely two-timing Marisa Tomei Bugs Michael Shannon as bad-ass white trash and Amy Ryan Brian F. OByrne and Rosemary Harris making brief exact impressions this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart- but not a forgiving heart- with a story that doubles back on details not for showy plot devices but to make clear every step of a familys perpetual downward spiral. If its not as mind-blowing as Serpico or Network or the Pawnbroker or 12 Angry Men it comes as close as anything Lumets done since.',pos
'Clubbed is yet another will-this-do? entry into the Brit fisticuffs genre and is sure to keep punters who arent expecting too much moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers. However for anyone seeking intelligent quality entertainment its really best avoided.<br /><br />There are so many misnomers in the appalling script that even an actor of the calibre of Colin Salmon is left looking daft. The action is set in the 1980s but its never clear why especially when they havent been able to pull off any convincing feel for that decade - it takes more than a few 80s soul records on the soundtrack the occasional zoot suit and a handful of 30-year-old cars. Then we see central characters studying texts such as Sun Tzus The Art Of War and speaking about how violence should be a last resort while the same characters seem only too willing to start doling out punches with all the testosterone-fuelled unthinking abandon of a bunch of chavs fighting over a bag of chips.<br /><br />Character development does not exist in Clubbed. Nor does irony subtlety or pathos. This is a film which trades on fond memories of Guy Richies early gangster films which despite their flaws certainly had much more wit better editing snappier dialogue and packed more emotional punch than this limp little saga. Theyre a decade old now anyway - isnt it time we moved on from trying to emulate them?',neg
'I mean really really REALLY high and this movie has a shot at entertainment. I dont mean regular high i mean the high where reading the phonebook would have you in stitches. otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence. A complete waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac John C. McGinley Tom Kenny and the master of hams Shatner) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make (the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies). Not without its laughs (again chemical aid is crucial) and certainly not without offending the politically over-sensitive (which Im always in favor of) but ultimately not worth the time out of your life.',neg
'In 1978 a phenomenon began. The release of John Carpenters Halloween got people queueing around the block to witness the evil that is Michael Meyers. The critics loved it the world loved it it was imitated and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history.<br /><br />plot: 15 years after a murder took place four friends (all females) are babysitting(and having it on with their boyfriends) on Halloween night. After escaping from a hospital the night before Michael myers Returns to his home town to stalk these people. He murders 3 of them silently and subtlety. He does not speak. He walks slowly. He hides....<br /><br />Only one of the friends escapes after being saved by Doctor Loomis (Michaels pursuer and doctor) <br /><br />There is one reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We dont know where Michael is we dont know why he kills and he frightens us. Theyre the only reasons why we are afraid.<br /><br />John carpenter wrote the movie and directed. He builds unbearable tension throughout the story and scares to such a degree that sometimes we cannot watch. And the climax is truly startling.<br /><br />As horror this is essential. It is terrifying and well acted. It is also mysterious. Michael is a force not a human. A force that cannot be denied.<br /><br />The sequels focused too much around Michael and his history. This movie focuses on the fear of the unknown. Perhaps thats why this thing is a masterpiece.',pos
'Oh where are you going my little one little one...<br /><br />Turn around and youre two turn around and youre four...<br /><br />I remember these shows when they were first broadcast on Disneyland. I remember sitting there electrified by Werner Van Braunes explanations of rocket science. I watched as history science and humor were all interwoven in an engrossing story of possibilities.<br /><br />That was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series and what a treasure they are. I watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter who at first would not even come in the room but later changed her mind when she saw they were partly animated. As she watched I watched her and by the end she was nearly as engrossed as I had been.<br /><br />Turn around and youre a young wife with babes of your own...<br /><br />Sure some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive. I found myself thinking my daughters teacher might want to show them to her class not only as a 50 year old artifact but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history.<br /><br />Turn around turn around turn around and again...youre wondering how much has really changed in 50 years.',pos
'This is one of the best episodes of Doctor Who EVER. We have the Cybermen The Cyber conversion units (May scare young children) and of coarse the Doctor doing one of his best acts. Bravo David Tennant. Good scenes as if it was a movie with thrilling scenes in some streets an invasion on the Cybermans base and leaving the world different to ours basically a 45 minute movie.<br /><br />Being Part 2 of Rise of the Cybermen this would never disappoint.

'Ugh. Pretty awful.<br /><br />Linnea Quigley gets top billing but her character doesnt have a big part. Who is her character supposed to be anyway the little boys aunt? Another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene. While there was a shower scene in the movie it was a head and shoulders shot. Perhaps there are some alternate versions of this movie.<br /><br />Quigley does have a bigger part than John Carradine Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens though. Carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog. No other characters are in the scene with him though hes sort of composited in or else there are over-the-shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else. Theres also a really bad photo of him in a cameo locket (it looks like a bad photocopy) and a decent picture of him in a family bible. He conjured up Jack-O originally or something like that.<br /><br />Cameron Mitchell briefly shows up on a TV as a TV horror host. Brinke Stevens is in the movie hes showing The Coven in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe. Evidently theres more of the Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD double feature Mark of the Witch/The Brides Wore Blood.<br /><br />Jack-O: whats it about? Darn if I know. A little boy is told a story about a pumpkin-headed demon killer and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason. She follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes etc.). The pumpkin-headed killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things and actually kills people.<br /><br />There are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too: ancestors of his I think. I think they figure into Jack-Os backstory but Im not sure how.<br /><br />The little boy is ostensibly the main character but we dont really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses has nightmares and will fight bullies even if hell get beat up in the process. More time should have been spent establishing his character. I couldnt have cared less if he died.<br /><br />Not recommended not even for Halloween.',neg
'A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novels characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didnt like at all though is that the main characters like Mandras and Pelagias father werent greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living but to me they didnt succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the films plot. Irene Papas was really great in her role a typical example of a mother living in a island during the 40s who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone. John Hurt Pelagias father also acted great. He reminded me a greek in many of his reactions.',pos
'The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood Jr. is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as Glen or Glenda Bride of the Monster and of course Plan 9 from Outer Space. This exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries such as Look Back in Angora and The Plan 9 Companion failed. It rounds up his surviving entourage many of whom have passed away since filming and gives an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director (down to the haunting music) this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day. The entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together Eds life and untimely death for the viewer. Best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater.',pos
'This is another fantasy favorite from Ralph Bakshi; after watching it on YouTube that is. Set in the distant past after the Ice Age it is a prehistoric sword-and-sorcery quest between good and evil. Nekron Lord of the realm of Ice and his mother Queen Juliana has set their sights on conquest of the known world. When their glaciers destroys the village of a man named Larn he (Larn) vows to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile the sub-human minions of Nekron and Juliana capture Firekeeps King Jarols sultry daughter Princess Teegra; but she manages to escape and eventually meets with Larn who promises to escort her back to Firekeep; if the sub-humans dont find them first.<br /><br />This movie did very little box office (as did most of Ralph Bakshis films) but has become a cult classic partly for the quality of the art a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famed fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. Also I have heard that the screenplay was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas the two men who had done Conan comic book stories and the background painters included James Gurney the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; though admittedly I had never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also the painter Thomas Kinkade noted for his artwork for figurines music-boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company besides paintings. And like Bakshis films The Lord of the Rings and American Pop this movie was rotoscoped but the process works better in this film than in the former.<br /><br />So overall I think its one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made and an awesome collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With plenty of fantasy sexual innuendo and thrilling adventure.',pos
'Its interesting how 90\% of the high-vote reviews are all comprised of *random username* from United States (no state pride??) who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same grammatical style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies. I would delve further into this suspicious trend but alas this is a review of the movie and not the reviews themselves.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a true avid movie fan. This means I have seen a great many movies from good to bad and can wholeheartedly claim that Facing The Giants is in fact NOT a good movie. It has good intentions but fails to meet many (if any) basic standards that I associate with a quality filmgoing experience.<br /><br />The Acting: Mostly Terrible Palatable At Best. Hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise me.<br /><br />The Dialogue: Clumsy cheesy the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit youd see performed in Sunday School or youth group function. The Rave Review Robots revel in the absence of meaningless words but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world and the complete absence of it is palpable. Lets just say the mean ol head coach of a team in a State Championship game would have a lot more to say than OH NO! when things are not going his way.<br /><br />The Plot: Mind-bogglingly predictable. It has been commented that this movie is not a Hollywood cliché and yet its like it was pulled directly from Making An Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies (including the mandatory quasi-romantic subplot for the ladies) and just had a Christian-themed coat of paint slapped on it. Im not lying or bragging when I say I had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception. Only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented here.<br /><br />The Directing/Editing: It too was patterned almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports Movie template. Still acting aside there werent many noticeable goofs so at least Facing The Giants was technically competent.<br /><br />The Message: Ask Jesus and He will grant all your wishes. Part of me hoped that this movie would end in the teams eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole If we lose we praise You part because in the Real World you WILL fail at one point or another and its good to be prepared for that. But in the world of Facing The Giants if you fail clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating. Another interesting question being what if the Eagles came across another team that had gotten religion? Would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last-minute saves or would the universe simply have exploded? <br /><br />The Bottom Line: For the hardcore conservative Christian Parents crowd lamenting the evils of Hollywood Facing The Giants will be another mediocre-at-best Christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film-making. For everyone else the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else. And a warning: Any attempt to show this to non-Christians will lead not to conversion but to derision. I give this two stars one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget.',neg

'This is the touching story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Each family has a gay son.

'Highly flawed but just about watchable `comedy that runs like a Farrelly brothers reject. The most criminal thing about it though is the casting. I couldnt for one minute believe Jerry O Connell and Jake Busey in the role of superstuds who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat nor could I believe (the very beautiful) Shannon Elizabeth as a streetwise tough cop!. Story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions although the `gross out meant to be `shock comic scenes (one involving an amputated testicle and another set in a sperm bank) are just plain awful.

'I wish I could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it espouses. But I cant. Another species could have come and mutated while I waited for some action. For such a controversial man Darwin lived the most conventional life. If you didnt know about the mad theories you could almost mistake him for a stamp collector.<br /><br />The film-makers have cast Darwin as a dullard which does him a disservice. Even when he briefly loses his mind due to his tireless theorising it wasnt interesting to watch. Maybe great thinkers are dull people? I dont know what I was expecting: a forehead-banging eccentric with wild hair and eyes espousing his love of all things simian the glint of madness straining from a furrowed brow? A long-haired hermit who babbled to animals? A head-cradling lunatic with eyes lit up like beacons of truth? All of the above would have been great. This is the movies for Scorseses sake.<br /><br />But there was none of that. No lightning no thunder no wonder no awe. Just Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly fresh from the Subtle as Breath School of Method Acting. I imagine that someone with Darwins ideas had a brain like a speeding train so why did this film just pootle along - chug chug chug - like a slow winter? The disappointment is immeasurable.',neg

I wish I never picked this movie! After I watched it I felt even more sick and I wanted to throw up. Afterwords(when I got better of course) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that the Dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one.

'EXTREMITIES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />A woman turns the tables on a would-be rapist when he mounts an assault in her home and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police in which case he could be released and attack her again.<br /><br />Exploitation fans who might be expecting another rough n ready rape fantasy in the style of DAY OF THE WOMAN (1978) will almost certainly be disappointed by EXTREMITIES. True Farrah Fawcetts character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assaults before gaining the upper hand on her attacker (a suitably slimy James Russo) but scriptwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before unveiling the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production. Would their final solution hold up in a court of law? Maybe...<br /><br />Based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after every performance the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action. Acing and technical credits are fine though Fawcetts overly subdued performance wont play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation.',neg

'ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the Ramones. I was too young during the bands mid-70s heyday to be very aware of them although I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally saw RNRHS on television one afternoon in the mid-80s when I was about fifteen years old and laughed all the way through it. (Isnt it every high school kids dream to trash his school and blow it up all set to a rockin soundtrack?) I recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the Ramones concert sequences over and over again thinking Man these guys kick ass! I have to check out some of their albums! The rest is history. Twenty years umpteen Ramones LPs/cassettes/CDs and three Ramones shows later theyre still one of my all time favorite bands and RNRHS still cracks me up every time I watch it.

'I dont think Im spoiling anyones experience of this film by telling you not to see it if you have anything better to do like clean under the stove. It gets dirty under there and youve gotta clean it sometime. <br /><br />I think the movie suffers from a lack of sex and violence though there is one car chase stunt that looks so dangerous it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer. Gargoyles heart is in the right place but its aspirations are conservative. It is at least not pretentious. But I had a great time acting in it playing the perennial idiot in the horror movie who says Whats down this hole? and dies for his hubris. Plus I got to meet Michael Pare. Every film junkie should work with a B-movie staple at least once before death. And Romanians are the loveliest people Ive met. Literally the loveliest. Walk down the street in Bucarest: if 7 of every 10 women arent absolutely beautiful youre walking down a street I didnt come across; and be consoled by the fact that at least 5 of the 10 are available for drinks.<br /><br />Part of the film was shot in Casa Radio an abandoned unfinished Classic Communist Bloc-cum-Georgian Nightmare edifice originally intended to house KGB propaganda ministries i.e. Radio Not-so-Free Europe. The buildings five stories tall and takes up a city block; best of all while its facade radiates Big Brotheresque state solidity it resides near the city center like a post-apocalyptic ruin in a jungle of burdock and hemp peopled by dozens of Gypsies and scores of wild dogs. Construction on Casa Radio was suspended when Caucescu and his wife were executed on TV in 1989 and still there are gaping holes that drop from the sun-baked top floor (offering surreal vistas of a modern quarter-mile stretch of concrete roof decorated with jutting rebar and old car parts overlooking a crumbling ancient city) all the way down to the damp creepy sub-basement (which doubles in the film for the Gargoyle lair.) No American-style guardrails or warning signs for Bucarest. <br /><br />Since the demise of the Soviet Union Casa Radio has hosted several non-union film shoots including Highlander III. It is attractive to producers because its a cheap location massive in terms of scale and available space bizarre looking and free of insurance headaches as its still state property. Plus no one complains if you dont clean up after your production: anything left onsite is interpolated into the resident Gypsies construction of their shanty town in this actual urban jungle. <br /><br />An assistant director was bitten bloody by a wild dog during the shoot of Gargoyle. The apples provided by catering were pressed into service by cast and crew as projectiles in order to keep the prowling dogs at bay. I too was bitten by wild dogs in Bucarest once in a bar (!) and once in a city park. I also survived two car wrecks in two weeks both in taxis and neither of which was seen by the drivers involved as grounds for stopping the cars.<br /><br />GEEK NOTE: The Sci-Fi Network or Channel or whatever was one of the backers of this film (the smaller the budget the more producers on set) so its a little weird that nobody had a problem with the original title Gargoyles until it was almost time to show it on the network even though Sci-Fi already had an unrelated series of that name. The title was changed sometime relatively close to release as I have a color-corrected copy labeled with the former title.',neg
'Im not sure if the filmmakers were after a Saw-type movie or 12 Angry Men (people piecing together the facts to get at the truth). Whatever it was it was poorly done and not worth watching.<br /><br />I dont watch movies for blood and gore but because this film had little else going for it it should have shown the actual killing more. Most were off-camera minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths.<br /><br />It also bugged me that the cop was among the victims; he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence (given to him by MJH) into the evidence room. (And wouldnt MJH a the prosecuting attorney have had access to that evidence--taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back--anyway so she wouldnt have needed the cops help?). The others while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming still played larger roles in his ultimate demise. The gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent. The insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need etc. But the cops crime seemed minor in comparison since he didnt know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged MJH to plant the evidence which would have made him more culpable. And MJHs yelling that he (the cop) got her in that mess doesnt make any sense at all.<br /><br />It would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why he/she was there and deserved to die. The insurance guy for example could have had the applications he rejected rammed down his throat so he choked on them; the Oriental woman could have had her eyes gouged out because she was a false witness etc. Yes more violent that the gun deaths but more interesting.<br /><br />The dialog wasnt witty there were no twists and the ending was one of the worse (if not the worst) Ive ever seen. The ending along knocked three stars off my rating.<br /><br />The actors did a decent job especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with.<br /><br />Overall a waste of time.',neg
'I bought this a while back during a massive martial arts movie phase. Although this certainly aint the best I do love this kind of film making and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars I always appreciate the fact that whilst he lacked formal martial arts training he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance. He also has a good beard. This movie has him in a good heroic role and although he doesnt kick as much ass as in some of his other movies he still acquits himself well. Early appearances from Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also nice too see especially for the fact that Chow Yun Fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play. He may not be a great fighter but he does OK. Eddy Ko is as great a bad guy as ever he performs the same villainry as in many of his other films and does it great as per usual. The fellow who plays Bu is good too I dont recall his name but hes in Magnificent Butcher too. Although the fighting isnt as good as other movies of the era The postman fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance. There are some very nifty scenes good characters and a good eclectic mixture of Hong Kong talents all coming together to decent effect. All in all I would recommend this to kung fu and general Hong Kong action fans. It may not be a stylised classic like the Shaw Brothers films or as crowd pleasing as Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee but it is rock solid entertainment.',pos
'How can such good actors like Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet could have been involved in such a... a... well such a thing ? I cant get it. It was awful very baldy played (but some of the few leading roles) the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny...

'Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture) is an attractive nice woman over-whelmed by a smart-mouthed teenage daughter Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a petty two-timing husband Sean (Rick Roberts) both of which were tediously self-centered and obnoxious.<br /><br />This was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm.<br /><br />The storm doesnt even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film and then it isnt anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar.<br /><br />The stalking likewise doesnt get intense until almost the end of the film.<br /><br />Most of the film we spend listening to Jill and her insufferable daughter Liv argue until I just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week.<br /><br />Jills problem with Liv is that she has taken up with Zack a boy of questionable character and they are constantly making out--in fact Jill comes home to find the two of them on Livs bed.<br /><br />The rest of the time we spend listening to Jills husband Sean either whine at Jill or criticize her.<br /><br />Sean was not at all appealing--since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots.<br /><br />The story begins with Jill being notified of an out-standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to and that she thought Sean had never been to either.<br /><br />Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso) a very nice older divorced man who is sympathetic to her. In fact when he spots her husband there again he phones Jill and tips her off.<br /><br />Jill returns to the hotel sees Sean with another woman. She is upset leaves without Sean seeing her and does absolutely nothing. In fact she doesnt even say anything to Sean when he arrives home. This made no sense to me.<br /><br />Jill has given Richard her business card and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate. She shows him a condo. Afterwards they have a drink and things get cozy between them.<br /><br />Richard and Jill are getting it on hot and heavy. In fact he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary when Jill suddenly decides to cut out.<br /><br />Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating. Sean whines about how Jill has been letting him down since her father died. Apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault. Eventually Jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to Sean--and of course thats all her fault too as far as Sean is concerned.<br /><br />The little family decides to go on a camping trip--which means more whining and grousing among them especially from the spoiled daughter.<br /><br />I was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody but Jill.<br /><br />3 stars',neg
'December holiday specials like the original Frosty ought to be richly-produced with quality music and a wholesome yet lighthearted storyline. They should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays. Basically they should look sound and feel...well special and they should have a decent and appropriate December holiday subtext.<br /><br />So when I saw Legend of Frosty the Snowman in the TV listings I got my kids (6 and 8) pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original Frosty and passionately relating how much I enjoyed it as a kid. As my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high but 10 minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and I were giving each other the look and rolling our eyes. After 35 minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed -- I guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless disconnected segments. I was actually embarrassed about their (and my) disappointment with this movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately Legend of Frosty the Snowman is more like a bad episode of Fairly Odd Parents crossed with a worse-than-normal episode of Sponge Bob than a classic holiday movie. Dont get me wrong...those shows are fine and I like them as much as the next guy but when I watch Fairly Odd Parents or Sponge Bob my low expectations (for mediocre off-color zero subtext mind numbing episodes) are always satisfied.<br /><br />We picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together. A much better choice than the embarrassingly bad Legend of Frosty the Snowman.',neg

'Forgiving the Franklins is the best film I have seen in years. The acting was fantastic..especially Mari Blackwell who was truly remarkable in the role of Peggy Lester. She brought Peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my own next-door neighbor. I also enjoyed Robertson Dean in the role of the father... he is a true professional and managed to pull off even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace. The performances by the entire cast were very good excellent in fact but Peggys role as played by Blackwell made the movie. The cinematography was beautifully done throughout and was most impressive. The only criticism I have to offer is a slight weakness of the ending scenes which were overly drawn out repetitive and a bit too focused on the wrong character. I would have liked to see it end on a note of forgiveness....but spite of that slight flaw it is very much worth the watching and applause for all involved in the making of it.',pos

'This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening. Well actually I watched both The Simpsons and Futurama and it gets a mention in both so I figured what the heck. The film brings home a few what ifs that make you realise how lucky we are in this day and age where we take simple things like soap and water for granted. Interesting though that in the year 2022 men are still shaving with a single blade safety razor! Nice that Those responsible didnt over load the film with unnecessary special effects ray guns etc. Some nice looking furniture once you figure out what that means.

'New York police detective Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life. The strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law. He has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used. Dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals. He is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his fathers reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence.<br /><br />When a rich Texan is murdered following an evenings gambling run by gangster Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill) Dixon is assigned to the case. Scalise tells Dixons superior officer Detective Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden) that the victim had been accompanied by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his wife Morgan (Gene Tierney) and that Paine had committed the murder. Dixon goes to Paines apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when Paine punches him Dixon retaliates and Paine collapses and dies. Dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river. Paines wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at Scalises place adds that her father had gone to Paines apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that shed returned home with facial bruising. Paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully) had threatened that if it happened again he would beat Paine up. This information leads to Taylor being arrested and charged with murder. Nobody accepts Dixons explanation that Scalise had killed the Texan and then had Paine killed to eliminate him as a witness.<br /><br />Dixon continues to make various attempts to get Scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in Paines death and the cover up. He does this and also records that he is going alone to confront Scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for Dixons murder. The confrontation with Scalise and the eventual means by which Dixon achieves his own redemption provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller.<br /><br />Dana Andrews strained and preoccupied expressions convey his characters perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow Paines accidental death. Dixon however isnt the only one to experience misfortune as Morgan a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her. Her father whod some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit. Ken Paine whod been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and Scalise whod been set up in business by Dixons father also suffers his own misfortunes.<br /><br />Where The Sidewalk Ends is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity.',pos
'Turner and friends are closing in on HBO for the top spot among made-for-TV movie producers. This is a nicely paced contemplative thriller of sorts. William Macy is stellar as always and Adam Arkin offers one of his better performances. A bit more lively than classic Hitchcock but not as in-your-face as typical movies of its type A Slight Case of Murder eases you in and never lets go. (Note: I saw a preview copy which means I didnt have to wait through commercials. Those interruptions may hurt the pacing but you know this will be available on video sometime',pos
'If I was still 5 I might find it scary. It is (I guess) a low budget film. The acting is not good but could be worse - the filming and special effect is awful. The story line is thin and not worth to dwell on. Too much time is used on boring shouting scenes. The chases or fight with aliens remind me of kids fighting with scary masks on. Some gore with blood and body parts - would scare a 5 year old kid I guess. Apparently scare the crap out of some of the persons in the film.<br /><br />It is far from reaching anything like the film Tremors.<br /><br />This turns out to be an incident and we see alien ships nearby earth.

'Her Cardboard Lover is Norma Shearers last movie. She quit the movies and I think joined the Board of Directors at MGM. That was a good move on her part. Her Cardboard Lover was talky and boring in parts. It was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat. <br /><br />The story was a good idea about a wealthy woman (Norma Shearer) hiring a man (Robert Taylor) to make her playboy fiancee (George Sanders)jealous. I am surprised that the director George Cukor did not cut many of the talky scenes between Ms. Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Cukor served Ms. Shearer well in The Women but not in this movie. <br /><br />The best performance in the movie was given by Robert Taylor. During Mr. Taylors career he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and When Ladies Meet in 1941. In 1942 he gave his best comedy performance in Her Cardboard Lover and up to then his best dramatic performance in Johnny Eager. He had a busy year. I think of all the actors at MGM Mr. Taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot. Also MGM gave Mr. Taylor all types of movies to make - most of them were successful. That is why MGM kept him for 25 years. <br /><br />Mr. George Sanders was very good as a socialite heel. He played a similar role eight years later in All About Eve for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role. As for Ms. Shearer this was one of her worst performances she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy. It is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939 The Women and gave her best performance. It was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in Her Cardboard Lover. Also it didnt help that some of her clothes were awful.<br /><br />Too bad she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together the superb Escape. The same comments about this movie can be said of another movie Personal Property that Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was too talky boring and the actress looked old. Ms. Harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in Hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor so in 1937 she died at age 26. What a waste! She was becoming a good actress and getting better roles.',neg
'There is an endless supply of trashy horror movies. It seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and thrill. Alas very seldom these attempts succeed. This unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value. The story is highly predictable most of the actors very uninspired or just plainly miscast special effects of very low quality. It took a lot of effort not to switch off the DVD and go to bed. With such a limited number of foreign movies issued in the USA why in the world would anybody want to import this drivel. To top it all apparently there is an Anatomy 2  for those who have nothing better to do. Id rather watch the paint dry.',neg
'Shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect certainly much more true to the Peter ODonnell books and comic strip than the previous two films. You can read the strip currently in the reprints from Titan Books or in Comics Revue monthly. It is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time. The movie isnt great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest. On the DVD extras the interview with Quentin Tarentino who is obviously stoned is a gas. Some people have faulted Tarentino for associating his name with the film but without him it would never have been made. He is a Modesty Blaise fan and picked a good writer and director. All things considered worth 8 stars.',pos
'The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it--much like Star Trek. Thats because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner. They are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. Because of this a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now its time to do the same for The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />Now I was very surprised when I saw reviews for this bland episode that described it as being among the best and gave it scores of 10. If this is the case then why is it that everyone I know who has seen this episode hates it as much as I do? Its possible that me and my family and friends are all cranks but its also possible this is yet another case of rabid fans rabidly inflating the rating on an average or below average episode.<br /><br />The episode itself stars William Windom and others as various archetypes--a soldier a dancer etc. They are all stuck in a cylindrical room with no escape and only at the end do you realize the shocking truth--which isnt at all shocking and is in fact majorly lame. No this is a badly written and unengaging episode. Yes there were plenty of episodes of the series that deserved a 10 but few as undeserving as this one due to a shallow script and an unappealing resolution.',neg
'Claire Deniss movies seem to fall into one of two categories: the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate. LIntrus definitely falls into the first category but its not so awful as Trouble Every Day or Jai pas sommeil.<br /><br />Now ever since I saw Chocolat Ive made it a point to see every new movie Denis makes. And I have always been disappointed. LIntrus was no exception. She has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one. <br /><br />You get a lot of the Denis regulars: an older but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips the gap between her teeth her ample cleavage and a couple of nice coats; the black guy from Trouble Every Day and Jai pas sommeil Grégoire Colin and that Lithuanian or Russian girl. Michel Subors character was interesting enough but the camera lingered on him at such length that I got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when somewhere in Korea I think he finally got it cut. <br /><br />There was certainly some action--gruesome murders a mans search for a son--and there may even have been a plot but one viewing wasnt enough to figure it out and two viewings are I fear out of the question. For one thing the score was jarring and obtrusive (as in Beau Travail). For another the seasons changed too abruptly leaving you even more confused about what was going on. Oh there were a few pretty shots and if you liked Friday Evening with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets you might appreciate the aesthetics of LIntrus. Otherwise steer clear. <br /><br />I saw this movie in French and its possible I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages double spaced and with ample margins. In Chocolat the silence is sublime; in LIntrus its just dull.',neg
'Herbet Clutter wife Bonnie and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of Holcomb Kansas--but in the early hours of 14 November 1959 all four were brutally murdered. Rather unexpectedly the crime made an impression on author Truman Capote who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Controversial shocking and exceptionally well-written it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day.<br /><br />The 1967 film version of Capotes work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many of the real-life locations it has a slightly documentary quality icy and detached--and the overall cast is exceptional. This is the film on which Robert Blakes reputation as an actor rests and deservedly so. As killer Perry Smith Blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; it is a masterful performance from start to finish. As Richard Hickock Scott Wilson is no less fine.<br /><br />Like Capotes book the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and brings them to the Clutter home--only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction. The centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the Clutter home; actually filmed in the Clutter house itself it is a spinechilling sequence horrific and deeply disturbing.<br /><br />Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy. Given the overall power of the film however this becomes a trivial annoyance. Strong stuff--and recommended.<br /><br />GFT Amazon Reviewer',pos
'HOLES is not your average Disney stuff- its very very fun even for adults who usually cringe at the cutesy focus-group designed family entertainment that Uncle Walts studio passes off as live-action. Perhaps the secret of this films success is in its faithfulness to the original book which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys prison camp where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation. But as the story progresses Stanleys tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie about an all-boy prison camp has any right to be. Jon Voight is especially nasty and colorful and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful as always.',pos
'Kudos to the writers of this film for creating a supremely engaging drama. The curious character development is indicative of a nuanced and well schooled writing team. The audience member cannot but help but to feel that (s)he must make wrenching emotional decisions pitting the cerebral against the libidinal. The viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself though her predictions are rarely validated.<br /><br />Credit is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting. The wood-shop is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds with its own traits faults a variety of highly charged relationships and of course a fate inexorably tied to that of the other principals.<br /><br />Make sure to catch this one at your local art-house.',pos
'Since growing up in Czechoslovakia I was following history of RAF pilots and crews in WWII Great Britain their stories and tragic ending either in the combat or in communist prisons and camps. This is without any doubt more than dark chapter in our history although the fact that those brave men were able to go through all this and recover afterward is amazing. To all people who want to see great movie...this is the one! During recent visit of Czech Republic I saw this movie three times in three days (they were just playing it for three days...otherwise I will go to see it even few more times!!! Its worth of it!) I hope you will enjoy it although it requires a little more thinking and knowledge of background information behind the story pretty much same way that the movie Kolya was. Its not a simple movie because of its deep story and the way its told will most likely make you crying...it did to me three times in row... Zdenek Sverak did as always a great script his son Jan made a great movie and the cast? Without doubt all of them did great job I was amazed by Ondrej Vetchy by great role played by Oldrich Kaiser and all other actors which made this movie simply GREAT!!!

'Peter Fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line-readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue. He trades sassy barbs and non-witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair; even his smaller touches (like fingering a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face) dont reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself an unsure filmmaker. In the Southwest circa 1950 a poor gambler (not above a little cheating) wins an orphaned would-be teen Lolita in a botched poker game; after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon the bickering twosome become prospectors. Some lovely vistas and an odd but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy-drama with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map. Shields is very pretty but--although the camera loves her pouty glossy beauty--she has no screen presence (and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever); every time she opens her mouth one is inclined to either cringe or duck. *1/2 from ****',neg
'Jim Brown stars and produces a tale set in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion. The story has the Japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers who they use to retrieve the gold that MacArthur had dumped into the Manila bay.<br /><br />Its a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism (The film uses Edwin McCains War in a not so subtle montage). The performances are just adequate at best. Jim Brown is okay but he doesnt really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed. The sets are serviceable but seem rather cheap. The film suffers from the outset due to a great deal of stock footage including many of the best known shots from the Japanese attack in Tora! Tora! Tora!. The use of such big budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film look positively anemic; it also reminds one that there are better films out there one could be watching. For me the film seems to have half a real plot the retrieval of the silver and half a plot that is there just to fill time. None of it is particularly exciting even with the explosive finale.<br /><br />Given the choice Id take a pass.',neg
'The movie is very realistic. Absolutely it does not belong to the Hollywood Cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise. The actors playing the roles of the lovers do a GREAT job representing the characters feelings and thoughts - their everyday life adventures. Overall the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state. This is where the realism of the whole story is apparent. Not everything happens the way we think it should happen. I can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note. We watch we learn we experience ourselves. That is probably the moral of this story.',pos
'The opening scene of this film sets the pace for the entirety of its ninety minutes. The shots are generic conventional and of television movie quality. The snow drenched scenery is gorgeous yet the characters held with in it have a similar quality to that of looking at a photograph of such scenery the overwhelming feeling being that of distance. Some of the editing is fairly high quality and the work of an veteran professional the dialogue however is clunky and artificial having little bearing on real conversations at all seemingly. Any emotional insight is displaced in favour of swearing which is of course the way in which everyone shows their true feelings. The action is slow and underwhelming the overall feeling being one of someone trickling cold water over your head but so slowly that you barely notice yet eventually you feel pathetic and slightly sorry for yourself for being caught in such a incomprehensible situation.<br /><br />The mixture of genres that the Fessenden has seemingly tried to use; psychological thriller horror and family drama although commendable suffers from a serious lack of tension and interesting dialogue. The way in which the husband wife and child trio interact is particularly unrealistic. The themes of family relationships being played out in haunting setting have been covered countless times before by far superior films an instant example being that of The Shining (1980). The family unit here are torn by innocuous troubles which are hard to understand or sympathise with considering the relative ambiguity of the script.<br /><br />The family unit is hardly stalked throughout the film Fessenden playing down the thriller possibilities of the narrative in favour of a slow family drama for the majority of the running time. The stalker figure Otis has few apparent motives for his behaviour and despite being perhaps the most interesting and well acted character is still very underdeveloped. The main characters are empty husks of people who it was extremely hard to relate to their relationships with each other being particularly void of any sentiment or feeling. Although the ignorance of the Erik per Sullivans young character by his parents is presumably part of the story surely any reasonable person would question their son if he allegedly spoke to someone who seemingly doesnt exist? People can accept this film as intelligent because of its relative lack of conventional aspects regarding creature based horror movies but this film fails in respect of whichever genre you wished to pigeonhole it in. You can read deep psychological meanings into every single minute detail of anything if you should so wish to but I think people would be better off over analysing their carpet for some deep emotional meaning rather than these vacuous sub-human creations.',neg
'Lets get this out of the way so the ones checking out this page looking for info on anything related to the word Breasts (and you know who you are googlers) can move along: this is not in any way pornographic. On the contrary if this has any value as masturbation material then frankly the filmmaker didnt do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on. Indeed I would be a little circumspect of one who came across this on DVD or if it ever plays again late night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a means for pleasure. You might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a pair of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh well you get the idea.<br /><br />No this is semi-serious film-making meant for premium late-night viewing but it shouldnt have to be just for the late-night types. This is intimate in setting but not in tone. All of the women in all their variety of shapes and sizes and races and even with one man thrown in with fake breasts have something of value to say from life experience in the most straightforward way. If I say semi-serious its due to the several little segments that the director feels she needs to throw in with the archival footage of old how-to videos about puberty and sex and breasts and super-rare cartoons with the knockers flying about. This isnt a problem but an asset: we need a few little visual seg-ways to go between these interviews.<br /><br />Nothing is held back and we see it as feminism in a liberating form: they dont need to cover up and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras off theyre still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex surprise comfort discomfort curiosity motherhood and sadly cancer. In that last part theres another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast. You know youve become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a semi-normal life with one breast (the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she would have to think about it) and you dont snicker or go eww gross. Thats the test folks.<br /><br />Its not shot under the best of circumstances but then again for TV its edited with a tight pace. Its never dull for a moment and we never feel like anyone is holding back especially when a man might hear the hard truth like that breasts may not really be erogenous or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men. Breasts: A Documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts laid bare. If thats worthy of a I was alone session then well more power to you I guess though its not the intention.',pos
'Not too many people seem to know about this movie. Which is too bad because I think its pretty good. Sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline. But the presentation of the movie is pretty well done. I think the casting is good with likeable actors/characters. Tom Selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player (go figure... not too much of a stretch I suppose) and Ken Takakura (from Black Rain) plays the chief (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). There isnt too much to complain about. Its just a light easy-going happy comedy and I recommend it.',pos
'Based on the best-selling novel The Dismissal The Missing Star the latest film by acclaimed Italian director Gianni Amelio is the story of the growing friendship between an older Italian maintenance man and a young interpreter he hires in Shanghai to be his guide through China. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is the Maintenance Manager at a steel mill in Italy that has been shut down and the blast furnace sold to China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) discovers that a control unit in the furnace is defective and potentially dangerous he travels to China to find the steel mill where the part has been sold in hopes of preventing a fatal accident.<br /><br />The film of course is about the journey not the destination to use a familiar cliché and on that journey we are privy to an engaging look at China with all its immense beauty and complexity via the outstanding cinematography by Luca Bigazzi. The film takes us to Shanghai Wuhan Chongquing Baotou and a trip along the Yangstze River showing us coastal areas that are scheduled to be flooded when the Three Gorges Dam is fully operative a Chinese mega-project that has resulted in the displacement of 1.2 million people. The trip brings the travelers face to face with poverty overcrowded housing and children left to fend for themselves.<br /><br />The film revolves around the relationship between Vincenzo and translator Liu Hua (Tai Ling) who first meet in Italy where his impatience with her translations at a dinner meeting causes her to lose her job. When he tracks her down in Shanghai she is working at a library and resistant to Vincenzos approach. Looking at his offer to help him in his travels in China as little more than a well paying job she reluctantly agrees to accompany him. Their relationship however grows as they move from city to city her interpretive skills much in evidence to help the bewildered Vincenzo who does not own a cell phone.<br /><br />As they slowly open up to each other they expose each others vulnerability and the film delves into their past and present life and how they arrived at their present situation. We meet Lius son (Lin Wang) at the home of her grandmother. In Chinas one child policy he is one of the unwanted children who have been hidden since the father of the boy abandoned the family. Although the meeting between Vincenzo and the boy is casual their relationship becomes central to how the story plays out.<br /><br />Castellitto is an excellent actor (though one longs for a younger Enrico Lo Verso in this role). However he is emotionally distant throughout the film his expression rarely changing from a far away hangdog expression. Though Tai Ling brings a great deal of presence to the role her relationship with the much older Vincenzo never seemed real to me and the ending seemed to exist only in a reality known as the movies. Though Amelio is one of my favorite directors coming on the heels of the brilliant Keys to the House Missing Star is a disappointment.',pos
'Ugly women-of-the-cellblock flick rakes the bottom of the midnight-movie barrel combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls-in-the-shower clichés. Linda Blair plays an innocent sent to jail (we learn offhandedly she was involved in running over some guy with her car) facing hard time in the Big House with some of the nastiest characters this side of a Russ Meyer pic. Blair is continually pawed at punched raped humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is four-letter-word disgusting throughout and the flick offers no let-up from its barrage of violence and stupidity. Still some viewers see this as a camp classic though perhaps its tongue isnt far enough in cheek. * from ****',neg

'This was absolutely one of the best movies Ive seen. <br /><br />Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back.<br /><br />I couldnt help but care about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will blow you away as will the young man playing the young lead.<br /><br />I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as its presented. <br /><br />The music is a blast too. Nice selections to represent mood time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs. <br /><br />This is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings. Take the time to watch it!',pos
'ID BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR!!!<br /><br />I did buy this film for a dollar and Ive seen much worse for much more!!<br /><br />This is a Scottish sci-fi film from Mark Stirton and according to the Making of (hysterical by the way) the production only cost $8000. Eight grand!!! That wouldnt pay for half a minute in Hollywood!! Nevertheless ---- This is top fun film making. If you like things gritty then youre in for a treat. These are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing. I didnt mind but my girl friend did!! The actors do a fine job and its interesting to see people that Ive never heard of or seen before. It meant I had no idea who was going to die first.<br /><br />If you watch a movie for its latest of the latest visual effects then watch a Star Wars. The effects here are OK but kinda weak in space. But the monsters are very well done if a bit pred like.<br /><br />Stirton does an amazing job with not very much and Id love to see his take on a real Hollywood movie. It least it wasnt predictable and I almost fell off my chair when one dude got his head blown off!!! OK so it is a little derivative of other sci-fi but for this budget it is an amazing attempt and anyone who thinks making a sci-fi film for 8 gs is easy or happens a lot clearly knows nothing about the film industry.<br /><br />Good marks for a good film extra marks for working so hard extra extra marks for a really interesting Making of. No standard bull here all the problems of production are gone into making it like Lost in Mancha only with a film at the end. But why no commentary? KEEP GOING SCOTS!',pos
'I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary. The musical score cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an Imax production. Even though it is shot for those huge Imax theaters it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. In fact this would make a perfect DVD to demo your system.<br /><br />The subject is also so fascinating. It is about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the CART Championship F1 Championship The Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son. The first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that Mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection. The other car is Michaels new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season. Imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating.<br /><br />Paul Newman who was Michael Amorettis team owner at the time this movie was made narrates the film. His anecdotes and witticism drawn from many years as an owner and driver lends much to the production.<br /><br />The main feature is the race scenes. Turn up the volume here! There is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow!<br /><br />The final magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world Mario Andretti is loving father who proudly watches over his sons career. They work together so well that every father and son should see this. You can tell that they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience.',pos

'One of those movies where you take bets on who will die first and who will survive at the end. There was just something about the movie that made me zone out. I think because I keep looking back and thinking yep still in that tree...still looking at the water. Poor character development. I felt nothing when they were in danger. I was voting for the croc. I found it hard to believe a croc would try to tip a boat in the first place and then when it jumps into the boat I find that really unlikely as well. The croc seems too supernatural at times (all knowing all seeing). Also when the croc attacks its behavior seems very unrealistic. Its a killing machine and wouldnt be letting victims escape twice to three times in a row especially when attacking in the water.',neg
'Now Im a bit biased since Im a big fan of late night television. Ive been a loyal fan of Jay Leno for about 6 or 7 years and think hes one of the funniest most talented comedians out there. And David Letterman is one hell of a comedian as well though I only watch his show (unless Jays a repeat) during commercials or when he has a better guest than Jay on the show. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are both fine actors and they very much resembled Jay and Dave but did they disappear into the characters? Nope. Roebuck barely nails down Jays voice and expression mumbling at a high pitch sounding like a castrati Marlon Brando. Higgins nails down Davids facial expressions (for example his trademark squirm) but he doesnt nail down Daves voice. Those who arent big fans of late night TV might be a lot less biased. Theres a couple comedians who can do dead-on impersonations of Jay. Why couldnt they have selected one of them for the part? And the same goes with Dave. Id rather they had Norm McDonald play the part. Norm doesnt look a hell of a lot like Dave but he did a great impersonation of him on SNL. Hey...you got any gum? That was so hilarious!<br /><br />However I learned a lot about the late night wars which I had very little knowledge of at first. I never watched The Tonight Show prior to when Jay Leno was host so I didnt know about the struggle to finally replace Johnny Carson and the countless negotiations that finally convinced Dave to move to CBS. I knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very enlightening. And Kathy Bates gives a knockout performance as the foul-mouthed former executive producer of The Tonight Show. She basically steals the film. <br /><br />My score: 7 (out of 10) <br /><br />',pos
'William Powell is Philo Vance in The Kennel Murder Case a 1933 film also starring Mary Astor Paul Cavanagh Eugene Palette Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. A dog show in which Philo has entered his Scottish terrier Captain serves as the background for a locked room mystery with too many suspects. The mystery is very clever and the denouement both complicated and interesting. Since the talkies are still quite young the camera work is a little static but Michael Curtiz does a good job directing the action.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent; the entire cast brings the film up a notch. Lots of actors have played Philo Vance including Paul Lukas Basil Rathbone Wilford Hyde-White Edmund Lowe James Stephenson Alan Curtis Warren William and others. Powell played it the most (five times) and is the best fit for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time. This was made before The Thin Man catapulted him to big stardom - he had spent about 12 years in film by then beginning his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20. A remarkable man a remarkable screen presence and a remarkable actor who lived to be nearly 92. Were so lucky to have his films available on DVD and on TCM today. The Kennel Murder Case is a great story and a fun film - dont miss it.',pos

It has some beautiful scenes and any one of them are nice to watch but tack them all together and it becomes an arduous task just to sit through it. I rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video carton and the fact that Im a big Shakespeare fan but I was very disappointed. I just found it a bit pretentious and at times boring.',neg
'Because of all the negative reviews of this film I almost didnt watch it. However I was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie.

'Great concept perfect characterizations and voices but a complete waste of time. A real shame since had it aimed higher it would probably not have been the bomb it was (is); way too dependent upon scatological humor for starters. Im amazed by comments from educated reviewers referring to the good science behind this piece of puerile trash. Unlike Finding Nemo where (with a bit of suspension of disbelief) attention to detail was staggering and the science was as good as the context would allow Osmosis Jones was utter nonsense; dont kid yourself about the science. Humor aimed at eight-year-olds but subject matter suitable more for some unsophisticated teens.',neg

'Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin Ed McMahon Roz Kelly<br /><br />Tony (Arkin) is your average ordinary high school guy. Prepping for the big homecoming game girlfriend trouble and growing hair in strange placesyou know the usual. But the hair in strange places part gets a wee bit out of control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with a wicked case of the furballs. Now doomed to walk the world forever young as a werewolf how will Adam get any girls?<br /><br />Full Moon High is not often talked about but it is a silly and entertaining horror spoof. Larry Cohen (Q the Winged Serpent The Stuff) incorporates as many gags as he can possibly come up with as writer / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween 20 Years Later) shows nice timing in the lead role. If you happen to be a fan of spoofs like Airplane and Student Bodies I think youll have fun with this chuckle-fest.',pos
'This is a plot driven movie and extremely entertaining. Nothing startling or original within the plot but crucially it moves along at a great pace and therefore keeps your attention. I didnt really notice the acting which I guess is a good thing. John Mills was fine but did seem to take everything in his stride somewhat considering how his life was falling apart around him. He would be clumped on the head stand up 20 seconds later dust himself down and carry on as if nothing had happened. A minor quibble in a film with a strong story authentic locations and a plot that continually keeps you guessing right up to its conclusion.',pos
'We watched this on The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC last night and I came to the conclusion that things must be tighter there at the Mouse than usual. <br /><br />Since this movie only runs 74 minutes and they had to pad it out to 2 hours of broadcast television time they had and Im not making this up commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes. And during these commercial breaks they had another advertisement in the guise of a TV show hosted by the oh-so-annoying Kelly Rippa that loudly proclaimed the magical wonders of Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True.<br /><br />Again and again break after break Disney took time out of the real movie to tell us the loyal viewers that we needed to get a copy of the sequel. Thank you Disney for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie.<br /><br />Anyway all this commercialism and cash-register-ringing made it a difficult task to get into the actual movie of Cinderella because by the time the commercials were over I had forgotten where the story had left off.<br /><br />But of course the original Cinderella still maintains its magic and the story is still a good one though weve all seen it countless times. Its a shame they had to cheapen it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame follow-up.',pos
'Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. All is in the cliché of the mentor and the talented immature pupil. The characters arent even interesting nor sympathetic. Artistically it is as empty and insignificant. The colours are very impersonal and light. Only the poster may be appealing. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. Too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate. But I cant have a complete comment on this movie any way as i got out from the theatre 20 minutes before ending. Everything was so predictable that it was a waist of time...',neg
'The video box for Joyride says starring second generation superstars and one cant help but feel sad. Granted Melanie Griffith has gone on to bigger and better things...but who cares about the rest of the cast? So with that being the pathetic attention grabber on the box I was foolish enough to purchase the film for a dollar thinking I would be in the land of so-bad-theyre-good 70s films Eh not so much. While so many aimless 70s youth films (or plain ol 70s films for that matter) tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful Joyride doesnt even try. Its just aimless. It is devoid of any interest whatsoever. Each character is so poorly conceived that its no wonder these actors look so listless.<br /><br />In a nutshell the movie is about three 20-somethings who go to Alaska to start a business but instead get robbed and then have to find work. They get beat up eat dog food steal cars rob banks. Its all very typical but on top of that its executed in the most mundane way possible. There are no surprises and the flow is so bad and the actions of the characters so ambiguous that you can miss several scenes and not mind at all.<br /><br />But if youre a fan of Melanie Griffiths breasts - then this is a must-see. Thats still not enough to get this above the lowest rating I can give.<br /><br />Best Line: Jesus everything is biology with you. * out of ****',neg
'This Is Not A Love Song is a brilliant example of the chase genre which many people think has an underlying meaning. The love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal. I believe that Heaton is in love with Spike but Spike is too naive to see this.<br /><br />I really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. With intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing Spikes name on the top of his letters.<br /><br />One thing Ive noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the film has been slated the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film as they havent even mentioned the possibility of Heaton having sexual feelings for Spike. I also get the feeling that some of the reviewers havent recognised it when they use phrases like: Who is Heaton? Whats he doing with a retard like Spike? This person however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark. Spike shows noticeable signs of having A.D.D although I dont think this person has realised this as he seems to be using the word retard as a derogatory term.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film. Although it is not for the faint hearted. The film is exceedingly character based after the shooting until the end there isnt much but dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Unless you are used to watching such deep gritty films stay well away.',pos
'Ill say one thing for Herman USA: it will probably always play well to Minnesota audiences. I cant imagine that theres another place in the world where a reference to the fast life of Bemidji or a line like I knew there was something wrong with Iowa guys would bring down the house. I actually quite enjoyed the first hour or so. Basically a bunch of lonely country boys take out a personals ad and find their town beset with willing female suitors (is suitors a gender-specific word?). It aint progressive to be sure but its sorta charming in its own right. Pity that the filmmakers felt the need to tack on a contrived subplot about a conniving golddigger and her violent husband. Overall its just too cloying for its own good but youve got to give some props to a film with the guts to give a guy with Kevin Chamberlins build a nude love scene. I will always applaud the depiction of people who dont meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual caring human beings but thats not enough to redeem Herman USA. To paraphrase Jello Biafra its nostalgia for an age that never existed.',neg
'I dont know about you but what I love about Tom and Jerry cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan sees Jerry leaving Tom behind to have an adventure in New York and as far as I am concerned this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat!<br /><br />As magical as Jerrys exploration of the Big Apple might be for the other T&J fans who have commented here on IMDb I couldnt wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to end so I could watch the next cartoon on my DVD.<br /><br />In fact the only part of the whole episode that I genuinely enjoyed was when Jerry almost buys the farm hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above a busy road.',neg
'Seems like a pretty innocent choice at first- the name employee of the month might ring bells with Office Space and the show Office Clerk. I think not. This isnt even a dark comedy. The director of this movie whoever the guys name was a complete jerk and has a sick perverse mind. There is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife steals from his top-notch job and lies through his teeth 24/7. The second I walk in to the room when my family are watching it (and believe me they were only watching it more because they were praying that there would be at least some relief perhaps even some fable in the end sending a warm message of good justice done and when the good guys look good). All the good guys were killed so long ago that they had no time to look good. No memorial was made.<br /><br />This movie has borderline insanity. It disrespects the elderly the dead and women- and the director tries to make people to like it.<br /><br />I gave this movie a two only because the soundtrack was good. But not even that was all that memorable. If you were lucky enough to not see this in theaters definitaly my friends- do not do this at home.',neg
'I had tried to rent this on many occasions but was always with the girlfriend who as a general rule usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment Uhm... looks good but im not in the mood for that movie. Thus entereth the Almighty Solo Movie Night!<br /><br />Anyway I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather enjoyable movie. While ultimately fairly forgettable it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldnt every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded and how easily do they wash off? The cast all fine actors in their own right put in a great job and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie both plot-wise and humor-wise but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original so I consider it a success! Rent this one for a good time maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. youll have a good time.<br /><br />***7/10***<br /><br />On a side note the soundtrack is spectacular. Its great to hear the far under appreciated Paolo Conte used and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled.',pos
'Ive rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it. So after 15 minutes of watching Ive noticed that something is wrong with this movie; its TERRIBLE! I mean in the trailers it looked scary and serious!<br /><br />I think that Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid the movie would be funny...(So stupid its funny...? WRONG!) He should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as:Fright Night The Lost Boys and The Return Of the Living Dead! Those are funny!<br /><br />Cabin Fever is THE reason why I registered to www.IMDb.com so I can release my thoughts of discontent about it.<br /><br />Ive decided to watch the movie a second time >AAARGH!< and make notes for my partial review to show how foolish the movie is. Resident Evil (horror) or Dude Wheres My Car? (comedy) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy! But this...!<br /><br />How bad can a script and a director be??? This bad. Here are the awful scenes in chronological order:<br /><br />In the early scenes we see Henry who doesnt realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead!<br /><br />The movie doesnt explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite people.<br /><br />And my answer to Marcys unanswered question (Whats wrong with the woods?) is nothing. The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for suspense.<br /><br />Then the smartest of the 5-pack Bert almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He meets now-infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the F-word. Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill. Bert:Dont make me shoot you! (he forgets to add: ...with my BB gun!)<br /><br />Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert doesnt mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun.<br /><br />Later as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire another weirdo shows up with his dog. (Maybe thats what the warning about the woods is all about? Its filled with weirdos...and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis. (Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so DUMB!) This is the last time well see this forgettable character...alive!<br /><br />Henry shows up at their cabin (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!!) looking worse almost like a zombie covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition. Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard seats and windows. The Fantastic Five come out running armed with: a BB Gun a knife a baseball bat (*huh? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods???) a poker and a (insecticide?) spray-can ready to combat the single unarmed and terribly sick man. (clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. What else am I supposed to do? Bert yells in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the trucks windows instead. Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say: Hes coming towards us! (Thanks for the info dumb broads I can see that! But I dont think he wants to do you any harm!) Marcy sprays in his eyes making Henry yelp! And our hero Paul touches Henrys arm with a burning log from the campfire which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin! (Where has all that wisdom gone? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away screaming.<br /><br />The following day Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to go for help all by herself in the woods as Paul stays behind with Karen...Doesnt that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already going for help!<br /><br />I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where shes going!? Anyway she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and like in most horror movies walks inside the cabin saying:Hello? Is anyone there? Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her (and me at first). And along comes Jeff as well. How did THEY get here!? Did they swim across the river??? Do you see how brainless the script is!?<br /><br />Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin. He somehow doesnt notice the blood on their truck. This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out. (Before I take my own eyes out!...Now THATs funny!)<br /><br />If you liked this movie do yourself a favor and watch Fright Night The Lost Boys or The Return of The Living Dead. Then youll see they are MORE entertaining than this...thing. Even the Toxic Avenger part 2 which is also a lousy film is way MORE funnier than Cabin Fever.',neg
'This is a feel-good movie and nothing more. And for that it is great fun to watch. Sure it skims over political issues. But so what? I am sure she wasnt trying to make Good Night and Good Luck here. Lets not try to make it anything else but what it is...light fare. <br /><br />And very enjoyable at that!<br /><br />Do we remember what 1984 was like? Weve become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not. I tend to differ on this point. Goldie knew this was fun-fluff and she went ahead and did it.<br /><br />Like her lightest fare: Protocol Overboard Housesitter Wildcats Private Benjamin Seems Like Old Times Foul Play Death Becomes Her First Wives Club and the remake of Out-of-Towners GOLDIE knows what she is doing...she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it! Goldie just knows herself really well and she knows what she can do really well.<br /><br />She has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently. I loved her in Laugh-In and every thing shes ever been in. She has never tried to be anything else but who she is...and thats that bubbling giggly girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and youve just got to lighten up because before you know it...you are old wrinkled and suffering from one of lifes inevitable ailments. If it even comes that late.<br /><br />I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a lovable comic actress.',pos
'I remember watching the Disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch. Plenty of other renditions Ever After put aside of Cinderella have in fact lost their touch throughout the years. Then I found this production with a flawless performance by Kathleen Turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood.<br /><br />We all know the story of Cinderella a young girl whos father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and stepdaughters and longs to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom. But this plot line takes a different twist in the classic Fairy Tale by causing Cinderella (whose real name is Zizola and is only called Cinderella by her family because of her slavery) to be trapped in a situation of her father (who still lives) slowly losing himself to a dominant wife who manipulates him into playing favorites with his wife and step-daughters against his own and tries to poison him. Thus Zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way. There the bored Prince Valiant has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress (forged by a water nymph named Mab) with rose petals for slippers. <br /><br />What drew me to this film most of all was its original take on the old Fairy Tale that none can compare to. It does not weave a web of lies like most Cinderella stories it does not ignore any reason as to why Cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the Prince as the Disney version did. Instead it shows more of Cinderellas selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning! The costumes are all beautifully made especially Zizolas sapphire blue ballgown to match the Marcella Plunketts fantastical beauty and soft spirit-like voice. <br /><br />I would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream-like sequence of the classic Fairy Tale with an interesting twist. My only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other Fairy Tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print.',pos
'J.S. Cardone directed a little known Video Nasty in 1982 called The Slayer and since then has gone on to have a hand in a handful of feature films; including the rubbish 2001 vampire movie The Forsaken. His latest feature film Wicked Little Things boasts a plot that sounds decent as well as a creepy looking poster that I seem to remember surfacing a couple of years ago in relation to a film that Tobe Hooper was meant to direct. Well I guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie fungus movie Mortuary and so turned this one down. I dont blame him for it either. The plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters that move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. However what they dont realise is that around a hundred years earlier; a group of children that were being used as miners were trapped down a mineshaft. Naturally thats not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now prowl the area in search of revenge <br /><br />The film is essentially a collection of clichés; from the youngest kid with an imaginary friend the mother who dismisses it and all the usual zombie rubbish. J.S. Cardone attempts to get the horror fans back on side with shocks and gory scenes (mostly involving kids) but its not enough. The story doesnt play out very well at all either and really did remind me too much of the earlier Mortuary and thats not a good thing (although Mortuary is actually a better film than this one). The acting is nothing to write home about either; Lori Heuring is decent looking as is eldest daughter Scout Taylor-Compton; but neither manages to provide an interesting performance. Chloe Moretz is slightly better than the usual child actor. The plot is given hardly any credibility and indeed the screenplay cant even be bothered to explain the reasons why the kids attack the locals. It all boils down to a typical and rather dull ending and overall I have to say that if you know your horror movies then you can feel free to skip this one!',neg
'I managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of MST3K and oh boy even with the riffing this movie was excruciatingly bad. Imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be out done by a monkey.<br /><br />The highlights (what little there were) came from the special effects which were OK. The acting for the most part was also OK; though nothing special it was of a higher quality than other B-Movies I have seen in the past.<br /><br />The rest of this movie is dismally bad The camera work often looks like theyve just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along. The story (if it can be called that) is so full of holes its almost funny It never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place or needs human flesh in order to survive. The script is poorly written and the dialogue verges on just plane stupid. The climax to movie (if there is one) is absolutely laughable.<br /><br />If you cant find the MST3K version avoid this at all costs.',neg
'Jaded takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director however has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.<br /><br />Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual. We are looking at victims and not titillation.<br /><br />The gifted cast rings true. For a film that is so little known I was surprised at the quality of the performances. They are good. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible.<br /><br />Somehow this film got lost. Perhaps it is too smart for its own good. It is a should see. Highly recommend. A thinking persons sexual thriller.',pos
'If a joke doesnt offend anybody it isnt funny.<br /><br />The Inki cartoons are offensive no doubt about it. So is rap music. Get over it. I suspect that any sane Black person will find the Inki cartoons hilarious and that the people who are offended by them White people who still think Blacks need their patronizing protection against racist humor.<br /><br />Seriously the Inki cartoons are funny. It saddens me that not because anybody is really offended but because somebody might just might be offended I cant buy Inki cartoons or The African Queen or Song of the South on DVD.',pos

'This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. Its the Shane Black script and its deft delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. Thank God it was never made. Too much danger of marring the original.<br /><br />The Long Kiss checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. Never a dull moment. <br /><br />This has to be Jacksons funniest role ever and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career. No quirky Tarantino hit-man super-cool Shaft or borderline psycho soldier. In TLKG Jackson is the everyman we identify with. The poor schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy womans odyssey to uncover the dangerous secret of her past.<br /><br />Though the story claims that Daviss character Samantha Caine is suffering from amnesia the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder.<br /><br />Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac Charly Baltimore -- she is a separate fully-developed personality. The traumas suffered by Samantha in the first half-hour of the movie help the submerged dissociate personality of Charly to emerge again.<br /><br />The materials of her past life excavated by Jacksons detective Mitch Henessey facilitate Charlys resurfacing. Good timing too considering the target Samantha makes of herself.<br /><br />But Charly has to fight herself to remain the dominant personality. One gathers from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality (Charly) developed after her father died and she was recruited by the Chapter.<br /><br />In the eight years Charly was buried in the psyche though her Samantha identity developed into the dominant personality. (Shes even funnier that Charly.) This was probably due to becoming a mother because its the reunion with her daughter that breaks Charlys struggle to suppress Samantha leading to their apparent integration by movies end.<br /><br />Its impossible to choose a best quote from this film:<br /><br />Now youre a sharpshooter?<br /><br />I saved your ass. It was great!<br /><br />Continue dying. Out.<br /><br />I sock em in the jaw and yell Pop goes the weasel.<br /><br />And a couple of dozen more many too raunchy to quote here.<br /><br />Geena Davis looks great and comes off as an action hero without glossing over the fact shes turning forty. (Listen to Charleys history do the math).<br /><br />Fantastic soundtrack too. Santana Muddy Waters Elvis LaBelle Marvin Gaye. <br /><br />I give The Long Kiss Goodnight a 9 only because I dont believe in a perfect 10. Seen it a dozen times and it still stays fresh. Nice twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to Its A Wonderful Life.',pos
'Rented the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing at it that I went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. Now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie I give them Sasquatch Hunters. It needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better. No talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are Sasquatch repeated in a chant. I loved the credit at the end of the movie as well. Thanks for the Jeep Tom! Whoever Tom is I say thank you because without your Jeep the movie may not have been made. In short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you dont mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy.',pos
'I really enjoyed Fierce People. I discovered the film by accident searching through my On-Demand movie lists trying to find something interesting to watch. The film is mostly about class in America and it quickly grabs your attention. The characters are smart and articulate and the story doesnt stick to the usual Hollywood rules.<br /><br />The main protagonist is Finn a precocious but underprivileged 15 year old who spends his summer with the Osbourne family. Donald Sutherland plays the patriarch Ogden C. Osborne the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays Finns mother a friend of Ogden who is also a habitual cocaine user and a slut. The Osbournes own a large estate and seems to live by their own rules. At first they seem charming and sophisticated but the super-rich are different. They are used to getting their own way. The film is enjoyable mainly because it has crisp intelligent dialog superb acting and a story which takes unexpected turns. It is also an R rated movie so its not entirely wholesome. <br /><br />The cast is excellent. Anton Yelchin is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of Finn. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is impressive as Osbournes devious grandson. Kristen Stewart is good as the pretty grand daughter. High quality movie.',pos
'One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obligated to express delight at even the least appealing films in the TCM library as this would explain him extolling the virtues of this charming film during his introduction when I saw this on cable TV. Seeing as any old film on IMDb receives classic status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers I thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film.<br /><br />This is not your fathers Shop Around the Corner. For all my quibbles with Youve Got Mail it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable. For those who have seen the original the flaws will only be all the more obvious.<br /><br />From one of the lamest Meet Cute sequences I can recall seeing (a sad slapstick attempt at humor) this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step. This musical only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term. There are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then theres Judy singing I Dont Care while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure. The Christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here. Miss Garland was wonderful in a number of musical films but here she seems horribly miscast. The role was originally to have been filled by June Allyson and Judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of Margaret Sullavans old part. Van Johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate Jimmy Stewart type. The leads never achieve the chemistry of Stewart/Sullavan or even that of Hanks/Ryan.<br /><br />This is a film that knows (some of) the notes but not the music. It doesnt really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for Van Johnsons character to complicate things unnecessarily. The remakes substitution for the originals infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin. It is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of Threes Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flux capacitor. Its really just an excuse for a Keaton pratfall. Even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled. After seeing both films youll understand why they called it the Lubitsch Touch and NOT the Robert Z. Leonard Touch.<br /><br />Avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of Judy Garlands earlier films unless youre an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth.',neg
'Ching Siu Tungs and Tsui Harks A Chinese Ghost Story aside from being one of the greatest wuxia pian films ever made is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an impressively choreographed martial arts film that should belong in every film lovers collection. The sorely missed Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends the night at a haunted temple. While staying at the temple he meets a colorful cast of characters that include the swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou the Tree Devil and the beautiful ghost Lit Sin Seen played by the lovely Joey Wong.<br /><br />To free her from the clutches of the evil Tree Devil he must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon.<br /><br />Enough good things cant be said about this film. The pacing is perfect with a great combination of romance action fantasy and humor and the feverishly paced finale should leave you with little chance to breathe. The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended much too soon) really allows the viewer to feel for both of them. Indeed the acting on the whole is so vivacious and full of life I would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences Ive ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his portrayal of the mysterious Swordsman Yin. His over-the-top persona of a disillusioned swordsman hell bent on vanquishing evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional HK drama. A wonderful score lush cinematography with eye popping colors and frenetic action pieces courtesy of Ching Siu Tung round out this wonderful film. Find a copy anywhere you can. 10/10',pos
'A pale shadow of a great musical this movie suffers from the fact that the director Richard Attenborough completely misses the point of the musical needlessly opens it up and muddies the thrust of the play. The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a Bway musical and examines their drive & desire to work in this demanding and not-always-rewarding line of work. Attenborough gives us a fresh-faced cast of hopefuls assuming that they are trying to get their big break in show business rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working gypsies living show to show along with a couple of newcomers. The film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count Cassie who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie). Anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly-conceived film.',neg
'As spectacle its hard to fault Nihon chinbotsu. The Japanese people have benefited from their intimate relationship with the sea and the concept of the film implies that an entire world and way of life at risk - thanks to its volcanic heritage. From the standpoint of reality its rather silly to have a drama wherein the entirety of Japan vanishes under the waves; why just Japan? <br /><br />So presume instead that we have movie reality fueled by spectacle (and popcorn) and some may find this quite affecting. Compared to adventures with Japanese radioactive monsters this comes off as more mature and better paced. The emotional element is underplayed and it really works. (It loses a bit with the overblown theme song at the climax however.)<br /><br />Is Nihon chinbotsu credible? Probably not but the thrilling eruptions and the relaxed pacing make for a more pleasing entertainment that one night expect.',pos
'Before you dismiss my post as not getting it let me say...Im one of the biggest Richard Kelly and The Twilight Zone fans out there. Donnie Darko is one my all-time favorites and I even thought Southland Tales had its moments. Im a HUGE sci-fi fan. I was very excited to see The Box couldnt wait for it to come out.<br /><br />Having said that...The Box is terrible. Behind Drag Me To Hell this was the worst movie Ive seen in 2009. And it just simply WILL NOT end! Whenever you think youve reached the end another change in the plot and youre off to more torture. I was actually groaning in the theater by the end of the film...I could hardly take it anymore.<br /><br />The biggest problem with The Box no matter how you slice it or try to justify it is that it simply makes little sense. Trust me I got it I understood what was going on. But that doesnt mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it. Take the basics for example. The main couple...Cameron Diaz and James Marsden playing Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses her finances at her job then bemoans to her husband that they are living paycheck to paycheck. Well sell that f-ing Porsche your husband is driving then!!! They live in a beautiful 2-story house in a nice subdivision. Marsden is working what seems to be a high-paid job at NASA and Diaz is an accomplished teacher. And yes Marsden drives an overly expensive car. But they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck?!? No need to press the button just cut down your high-priced lifestyle a bit! The movie would have worked better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt. Instead they are seemingly desperate for money...all the while living what I would call a luxurious lifestyle. Like I said...you can understand whats going on yet it still makes little sense! Thats a rare combination.<br /><br />There was an awful scene in a library that I feel will go down as one of the worst segments in movie history (terribly acted too by the way). It was idiotic illogical and out of place. I cant even begin to fully describe it actually so I will move onto a subplot that involves nose-bleeds and body possession by aliens. (Yes Im being serious unfortunately). A kid is in Diazs class with a wicked and smile on his face (a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at the school). He starts asking Diaz personal questions literally embarrassing her in front of her class. No punishment is given to the kid whatsoever...he didnt even get asked to stay after class for a talk! Then Diaz is at a party...and the same kid is one of the hired help...ironed shirt apron and all! I dont know many alien-possessed kids (who appear to be in Junior High) that also moonlight as a bus-boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials...but we found one here! (See what I mean...you can understand it completely but it still makes no sense...a rare combo!) Like many things in the movie the kid comes and goes...no real explanation about him no ending to his character. Moving on... A lady then approaches Diaz in a grocery store telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. Well...hmmm...if aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotely...and the aliens dont want to help Diaz...then who was taking over this ladys body and giving Diaz advice?! Again...The lady was trying to help Diaz...and the aliens werent interested in helping Diaz...so who the hell was controlling her body?! Never explained. Never talked about again. No nothing!! It goes on and on and on like this for what seemed to me like 2 weeks. It would not end! I wonder if this movie underwent a massive re-shoot at some point. It was poorly edited. Diazs accent was there one minute gone the next. Sub-plots began but never ended. The numerous push-backs of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product. Its truly a train-wreck.<br /><br />Pass on this one...theres no redeeming value in it whatsoever. 3 out of 10 just because I like Diaz and sci-fi! But it probably deserves a 1 out of 10.<br /><br />Thanks for reading! <br /><br />JD',neg
'BEWARE SPOILERS. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it. Okay so the goofie foreign guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny. This guys boss was good too. But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two should have had a lot more time on screen together. Theyre chemistry was great. The bathroom scene-WOW! Romantic sweet yummy.<br /><br />Hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians. To talk about Sarandon would be to give a lot away. SPOILERS This is a rather untypical romantic/political comedy and it satisfies both somewhat-the political side a whole lot more than the romantic. It touches on political issues and just barely skims on romantic areas.<br /><br />',pos
'OMG another bad film by Larry Buchanan. That guy did not learn to stop did he? First he gives us zero budget sci-fi movies and lies about famous dead people and now he is exploiting the Loch Ness Monster as being vicious.<br /><br />The plot is basically about some southerners of the USA pretending to be Scottish camping out at Loch Ness. Alas out on the fishing hole oops I mean lake of Loch Ness there is a killer inflatable monster that clams itself to be Nessie going out of its way to kill people for no apparent reason.<br /><br />I am surprised that the crew of MST3K never heard of this movie.

'When it comes to movies I dont easily discriminate between crap pure crap and masterpieces. I believe this movie is an absolute masterpiece and its hard to keep me entertained for more than 90 minutes. This movie ran SLOWER than Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 combined and I still managed to stay riveted to my seat. For me it was the passion that Eric Bogosian put into his performance. Its extremely difficult to pull off such a stunt and manage to garner any positive effect from it. Bogosian probably nailed one of the toughest single-man performances in modern cinema. I didnt have any respect for Bogosian until the end of the film. The entire monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point it was the key that turned me around. This man hit a point so low that he knew he could never recover from it. The corporate boys congratulated him on the performance. His blistering prose made even the slimiest one in the cavalcade shake his head in awe. It made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy dont matter in the world of talk radio even in the corporate world for that matter. Stone may have been pushing some uber-liberal agenda but it was the actual movie and production that got my attention. Oliver Stone is a minor master of the moody. The final third of the film had probably the best lighting and cinematography I have seen in any film. Stone artfully makes the DJ booth feel like five-by-seven cell in a nineteenth century prison. Visually speaking it appears that Bogosians only friend is the black foam that absorbs his routine vitriol. He speaks and it doesnt speak back. Its a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who handed him his success. Stone and Bogosian carved out a stunning film of a man who is trapped in both a prison of walls and a prison of self. This man is confined to his own volition and he can never escape it. The scene that made me realize his conundrum was when he was unwilling to his ex-wife back. He preferred his own prison instead of the world on the outside. Every story has a conflict and it came down to the simplest of all conflicts: man versus himself. Talk Radio presents this conflict in an intelligent gripping and artful fashion. There are no hidden messages in this film and the progression of events should be expected by any astute viewer. I just leaned back and let my mind be grasped by this film and I loved it. Its unheralded unseen and it will never receive its due recognition. Lets hope it stays that way because gems deserve to be found and then hidden again. Its a gem because I found it in the discount DVD bin at my local Wal-Mart store. For $5.50 it was worth the half-hour I spent digging trying to find it. I did and I got more than my moneys worth. This is one of the best movies ever made and that is worth ten reasons alone. Ten reasons give a score of ten.<br /><br />Here ends my rant!',pos
'Skip Mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space on its own is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note watch Galactica the original Star Trek and then the revival Trek series and youll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.',neg
'Look dont get me wrong I love independent films but COME ON! I could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been OK to a F***ing Nightmare. I am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked. the acting was crap.<br /><br />I am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one this one didnt even try. Please dont waste your precious time and money. I am sorry to be so harsh but come on! it dragged on and and on and on.

Ten years later i hitched hiked through the country side of France and i sure would have been keen to see Michelle. The film is probably not very sophisticated by todays standards mores the pity but it seemed rather racy back then. A few years later a sequel was made with Michelle living in a high rise in Paris and Paul coming back to meet her just like life they had moved on the film was very downbeat. Still the original was fab and if you can get a copy go rent it just remember to give it its due and treat it gently.

'A mock documentary about a pair of Canadian producers Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek) trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. Hollywood North is the comic tale of their struggle to pull everything together despite a number of conflicting threads.<br /><br />Hollywood North works as a film in a way very similar to why This Is Spinal Tap (1984) works so well. Namely although exaggerated in some ways it is very close to the truth and the truth consists of behind the scenes facts that are very different than the public face of the industry. It isnt easy to make a film and it must have been especially difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. Films involve tens if not hundreds of people. Many have incompatible desires motivations and personalities. Especially crucial are the financiers and the on-screen talent as if either drops out or becomes undependable at any stage while the film is in production it could jeopardize the whole affair either necessitating extensive reshoots or abandoning the film altogether.<br /><br />So its not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on those kinds of relationships. The result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time. The script is flawless and the performances are top notch. This is a must-see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of film-making. It should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a modicum of intelligence and a sense of humor.<br /><br />A 10 out of 10 from me.',pos
'A funny thing happened to me while watching Mosquito: on the one hand the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does (mutilating mannequins...er excuse me corpses) through his images. On the other hand the English version at least is very badly dubbed. So I found myself wishing there had been both more AND less dialogue at the same time! This film is stupid (funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town) and lurid (where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene?). Not to mention the romantic aspect (oh how sweet!)...Miss it. (*)',neg
'Here is a fantastic concept for a film - a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputys single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over. Leave it to Albert Pyun to screw that up! Dont get within 100 feet of this flick! Holy crap what a bomb...it might be Pyuns worst yet! The crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here - an entire of an outbreak told from the POV of a dashcam. When I heard that a while back I imagined the car smashing into stuff people getting run over and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos. That would be cool right? Instead we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there. The last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera just noises are heard offscreen. Stay away!!! On a somewhat relieving note I think I am officially calling an end to my Pyun watching...only took me 20 crappy movies to realize I have better things to do.',neg
'This movie has more goofs than any other movie I have seen in my life. The special effects are damned terrible. For instance near the end when the Concorde is falling after the cargo door tears off the thing spins like a toy. The special effects of Airport (1970) are way better than this crap. Also the force of a Concorde opening up at altitude and speed would essentially turn the thing inside-out. (That is if it would even open at all) But the movie has its good points. Mostly when it ends. Thats also cheesy. E.g. The Thing lands on a bank of loosely-packed snow if it did that it would splinter into a million pieces. Overall 2 out of 10. Instant flop. Great laugh flick.',neg
'I registered for IMDb just to comment on this movie. <br /><br />I just got done sitting through this movie and the only thing that impressed me was that I somehow had the will power to not stop it.<br /><br />Ive seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights Ive ever seen in a movie. Most of the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent isnt doing the same. Ive seen a good many student films with better action and stronger plots.<br /><br />So now we have a futuristic action movie with poor action and virtually no sign of the future. <br /><br />Most of the movie doesnt even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the Princess and the farmboy/terrorist and his disturbed sister. The movie has multiple plot lines and none of them really pan out to be worth anything. <br /><br />Part of the problem may have been that I watched the dub which was quite bad. The entire cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on. But I got the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes)<br /><br />If youve heard about this being a futuristic action/ninja flick then youve heard wrong. Thats what I thought it was when I heard about it and now Ive lost 90 minutes of my life. Dont let this happen to you. Steer well clear of it.',neg
'The Core meets Crack in the World (1965 made for TV). The acting is stock the suspense predictable. Once you subtract all of the plot ripped off from The Core - basically the manned drilling machine - you end up with the plot of Crack in the World. Crack was a truly excellent movie starring Dana Andrews. His team of scientists working in South Africa drilled down to the crust and punched through with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of geothermic energy. One of his subordinates also a brilliant scientist disagrees. He believes that the blast will not drill a simple hole but will instead form cracks in the crust. (Possible spoiler) He is right. In order to stop the resultant crack from destroying the earth they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack. <br /><br />Although I have placed a spoiler warning i dont know if I really spoiled anything for either movie. And since Crack in the World is only available in very rare VHS format if at all my decision not to reveal whether or not the counter-blast works is probably academic.<br /><br />All in all I rate Descent just below average.',neg
'This is an excellent example of an entreatingly bad b-movie. There are worse movies than this one (Titanic for example) but this definitely shares the pile of steaming crap movies.<br /><br />OK this was apparently shot in Kansas City which explains why everyone is so lame. The main guy looks like Steve Guttenberg and is even more lame than him! I didnt even think that was possible! In fact him and the main girl in the movie are responsible for the WORST DRAMA EVER! Its not just that there acting was waaaaaaaaay over-dramatic well actually it was of course the script was terrible which combines for a deadly one-two punch in bad terrible utterly unwatchable drama.<br /><br />The scarecrow lets talk about him. The whistling you hear every time hes around is stupid and obviously dubbed in. Now his costume I cannot get over that - its a guy wearing burlap sacks and a stupid mask! I simply am dumbfounded maybe if your 3 years old with brain damage youd be scared of him/it.<br /><br />One of the characters the token black guy actually used the line: This might be a chance to earn my red wings when referring to trying to score with one of the girls on her period. Wow um yea that is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to.<br /><br />Oh in the beginning when the scantily clad girl is running through the corn why is it roped off? Im pretty sure its not supposed to be evident just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this film Another is the bad dubbing for the musical number (yup thats right) there all at the beach and the one dorkaziod gets up the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone and its so obviously dubbed its funny. Thankfully the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear right through the guys chest when hes done singing. Overall the gore like that is pretty good this is one of those films when you rooting for these people to be killed by the killer.<br /><br />OK theres a scene where the 2 guys bury one of their friends in the sand then stand up whip out their peni and urinate all over the guy in the sand. Who does this? Really imagine it Hey lets bury joe in the sand then stand up and take out our genitals like its no big deal and pee on him In fact this brings up the homo-eroticism in this film what the hell? A good part of the beginning of this movie is the jocks standing around in there underwear in the locker room and corn field while there doing the hazing. What the hell is with that? Traditionally in film and real life jocks get the girls and nerds dont. That really doesnt make sense as all nerds think of is girls and sex and apparently all jocks think of is sports and being around each other in their underwear I dont get it.<br /><br />Lets get to the sex. As someone who watched this movie with me put it: Ive never been so disgusted by heterosexual sex in my life and its true. If you like hot A cup action or ugly old woman boobs then this film is for you. I swear they found a girl with the smallest breasts ever and this is who they get to do the nude scene?? Then the ugly old woman nurse shows her bouncy ones a couple of times and man I just didnt want to see that.<br /><br />Now I have to talk about the timeline continuity to this film thats what really is just bizarre. It starts in the daytime then they all head to the cornfield and within like 2 minutes its instantly dark middle of the night when they drive off from there saying their going to the beach - its instantly day again and apparently they stay at the beach until night again and until day the next day. SO basically these events in the film cover 4 days without any of the characters needing sleep or anything its really weird.<br /><br />After the main killings have taken place it flash forwards to 3 weeks later and apparently none of these people actually care that they saw their friends brutally murdered! The surviving people literally pop some champaign! And thats when I realized the budget didnt go to the script directing or acting it all went to that freakin bottle of champaign.<br /><br />The ending. Stop reading now if you dont want the ending spoiled for you it truly is enjoyable.<br /><br />OK so the end takes place in a church and the scarecrow put his soul inside the diabetes kid body then he fights with the steve guttenberg lookalike guy and he fights him with a b-movie version of the power the emperor had in star wars! Im not kidding its so stupid! So somehow in the middle of the fight the scarecrows soul jumps bodies into the guttenberg jr. guy and then with the last amount of will he has of his own he impales himself on a cross in the church! Its awesome! Some blood but whats even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard! You can see the bottom move off the ground! Wow yea have fun watching.',neg
'I felt I had to add a comment after seeing the breathless gushing of the other comment. I was taken to see this film as a child by my unknowing parents expecting a normal Norman Wisdom jolly romp comedy. Instead what you get is this insipid British sex comedy of the worst kind where Norman (Norman!) plays a swinger aiming to get off with as many birds as possible. Absolutely typical of the genre - poorly filmed and acted no semblance of a script beyond the worst kind of double-entendre and very vague hints of naughtiness. And all seemingly on that special grainy film stock that is reserved for 1960s-1970s British low budget films. About the only memorable thing is the annoyingly catchy theme tune which still pops up in my brain after 30-odd years.<br /><br />Finally in the last scene you also get to see Norman naked - running across the sand and looking frozen. I think so anyway- at that point my mother hauled me out of the cinema. I saw it again many years later and guess what it was still dire.<br /><br />If youre any fan or take any interest in the little man and his career youll apply the 10-foot-bargepole rule to this. Believe me you do not need to see Norman Wisdoms backside.',neg
'Flipping through the TV and saw that The Secret Life of was on; gave George Duran a shot at being the host. I know that Jim OConnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but George was well dull. He really didnt seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests. It seemed like he was interviewing guests for Unwrapped and he just happened to be in the shot. I dont know if George is going to get better hosting this show I doubt it because he has hosted his own show now. The show did seem to pack more info in but only because we saw less of the host. The formula of this show was very delicate and I fear it has now been disrupted for good.',neg
'The second official episode of the Columbo series (Murder by the Book filmed later hit the airwaves first). Robert Culp who would match wits with Peter Falks detective in several future installments is terrific as the short-tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency who murders a clients wife when she refuses to cave-in to his blackmail schemes. The two stars are well-matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series.',pos
'The film had many fundamental values of family and love. It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story. The script was clear( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children)and was enjoyable and humorous at times. There were a few charged symbols to look for. The cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today(which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out). It was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it. Although editing could have been done better I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy. And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I didnt like either but in all it was a good movie.',pos
'OK so i am like most people give me free tickets and i will go and see most things now that multiplex cinemas are so good (i remember the old flea pit single screen cinemas and i am the healthy side of 40).

'I cant figure Al Pacino out. I watch him in the Godfather Scarface Carlitos Way and I think I am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. Then I see him in Two for the Money Any Given Sunday and Revolution and I wonder what the guy is thinking.<br /><br />I stumbled on Revolution a few nights ago and thought I would invest the next two hours on this. Here is a news flash: Want to get prisoners to talk? Force them to watch this over and over...theyll confess to anything.<br /><br />I wont rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot but it does take place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved but ultimately does. While he has no money no education and dresses like a caveman a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason since they have only two minutes of dialogue together.<br /><br />Quite frankly if Al Smith starred in this movie instead of Al Pacino it would have ruined their career. The script was horrible but Pacinos demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse. Donald Sutherlands role was laughable. I really cant describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character but has like 5 lines in the movie. In fact nobody speaks much in this movie.<br /><br />One of the most laughable premise in the movie is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield. Its like the entire Northeast is a Starbucks. Hey funny to see you here again on ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles away...see you in a few months.<br /><br />I am required to give this one star by IMDb since there is nothing here for a negative score.',neg
'I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured Scott Baio (a skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first grown-up role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that Ill never get back! No noteworthy characters unbelievable storyline questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all I couldnt have cared less. The story of California teens in the 1970s where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Dont waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.',neg
'I actually had quite high hopes going into this movie so I took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best. About 1/3 of the way through the film I simply had to give up quite simply the movie is a mish-mash of stuff happening for no apparent reason and its all disconnected. I love movies that make you think but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected.<br /><br />Dont think its David Lynch-esquire as some would have you believe it is nowhere near that realm other than some trippy visuals. Saying its artsy to disguise the fact theres no apparent plot or story is just a manner or justifying why you wasted the 1.5 hours in the film. The acting was good but that cannot save lack of story. I do agree with the one comment posted previously... its like being in some other persons head... while theyre on drugs in other words nothing makes sense.',neg
'Jennifer Montgomerys Art for Teachers of Children is a stunning disturbing masterpiece. Montgomerys gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifers seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor. The scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifers mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful Ive ever seen captured on film. The lesson ultimately learned here? Theres nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art. Well I would highly recommend this remarkable piece of Art for anyone interested in thought-provoking independent cinema.',pos
'A bumbling error at the Ministry Of Education results in Nutbourne Boys School having to share with St Swithins School For Girls. This bemuses the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all manner of chaotic goings on however the two are forced to come to an uneasy alliance in the hope of averting major trouble.<br /><br />The Happiest Days Of Your Life is based on the John Dighton play from 1948 with Dighton writing the part of Headmistress Whitchurch specifically for Margaret Rutherford. Replacing George Howe from the play in the role of Headmaster Pond is Alastair Sim and here in lies the crowning glory of this filmic adaptation Sim & Rutherford are perfectly wonderful bouncing off each other to keep what is basically a one joke movie highly entertaining. Directed by the gifted Frank Launder and produced by the equally adroit Sidney Gilliat The Happiest Days Of Your Life is a quintessentially British movie obviously a precursor to the St Trinians franchise the film entertains the children with its high jinks clash of the sexes heart whilst tickling the watching adults with its very saucy undercurrent. Thankfully the chaotic ending cements all that has gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin as wide as Nutbourne Rail Station great fun 8/10.',pos
'This film gives new meaning to the term uneven giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the majority of the thrills.<br /><br />The plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death. She also may be seducing their sons.<br /><br />It is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film but unfortunately theyre not very convincing particularly the scene where Melvyn Douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him. Its no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible especially the giggling Ricky. They deliver the worst gee-arent-we-all-drunk scene Ive ever watched.<br /><br />The movie has a few saving graces namely Dick Smiths great ghost makeups (however misplaced they are in this film) and Alice Kriges fascinating performance as Alma/Eva. Ive never read the novel that this film was taken from but I intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page. You dont have to have read the book however to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale. There is a good story here but it seems lost somewhere amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share. <br /><br />As it stands it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print particularly near the climax. After all...how is it that Fred Astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly? What did Gregory Bate and the kid have to do with Eva? And while were at it...what the hell was she anyway? Why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear? If it was an apparition how could it have sex with two men and have them not know?<br /><br />These and other questions will never be answered at least not by this film. Unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some oozing makeup bizarre sex scenes and nudity and a few attractive performances.',neg
'the town of Royston Vasey is a weird but wonderful place. The characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works and it works very well. Most people will know others with a touch of some characters but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as Tubbs and Edward the stranger-hating owners of the local shop or the pen-obsessed Pauline who treats dole scum with much contempt.That was only a few of the strange inhabitants. The TV works consists of 3 series and a Christmas special. There are references to many horror films such as the wicker man. A more recent addition to the range of works is a film the league of gentlemens apocalypse of which I will not say much but highly recommend. All in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters. I would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it!',pos
'Considered by many to be a strangely overlooked Chabrol it seems to me the reason it has been cold shouldered is its sleaze factor. Not as overtly sexy violent or gory as many films of this period it nevertheless starts rather startlingly and although becoming more measured continues to ooze a rather unpleasant odour. Ms Audran not here the ice maiden but a drunken mother Donald Pleasence does a cameo as a child molester David Hemmings has his eyes on underage sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother sister and niece. No not very nice at all and Chabrol treats it all as if it is very normal (like it might be in some small French village!) instead of Ed McBains New York City. Had this been treated in a more sensational manner then it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film. Here we really have to choose between the likelihood of various unpleasant options before the final denouement. Very watchable',pos
'As is often the case films about self-loathing characters do not usually make for good drama. Downloading Nancy is no exception. Its supposedly based on a true story about a woman whos murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet.<br /><br />The protagonist is Nancy (Maria Bello) who is married to Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar/restaurants. Unlike most human beings Albert has virtually no positive attributes (except for his ability to be successful in the business world). Throughout the film Albert has a grim and dour expression on his face. He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes. When his wife asks for sex he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead.<br /><br />Nancy is equally one-note as a character. Not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up (thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film). Her self-loathing takes the form of self-mutilation and a result shes forced into therapy. However she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made.<br /><br />Finally Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis over the internet. Hes sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot. Its revealed that Louis has two children but no longer sees them (the childrens mother no longer wants anything to do with him).<br /><br />Nancys plan is to first have painful sex with Louis and then have him kill her. Theres a particularly unpleasant scene where Louis has sex with Nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass. These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis pays a visit to Albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club. It seems that Louis has a two-fold plan in going to see Albert: 1) berate him for his treatment of Nancy and 2) enjoy the beating he receives. It takes awhile before Louis will reveal Nancys fatefirst he forces Albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future. Nancys fate of course is that Louis finally ended up choking her to death (but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some feelings for her). We soon learn that Louis is imprisoned for life for Nancys murder.<br /><br />What exactly are we to take away from a film such as Downloading Nancy? Are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is that the main point of the film? Is sympathy for Nancy actually warranted? I dont think so. The films writers create a straw man in the character of Albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for Nancys decline. But are people so one-dimensional in real life? I think not. They have the repulsive Louis a man who makes a living by inflicting pain come over and berate Albert for neglecting Nancy. Furthermore his expressions of love towards Nancy (before he kills her) is supposed to show his sensitive side.<br /><br />In the end it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film. They are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence that Downloading Nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography.',neg
'This movie was really bad. I mean really really bad. The scenes were like from a parody and special effect sucked a lot. And it was filmed in 2003!!! i think this was a great waste of time and money and Michael Shanks with his Shaggy from Scooby Doo image just made me laugh. Never waste your time with this picture... I really dont know what the director was thinking after seeing the final cut of this movie but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to look on them. The latex cat women fighters were like sheep just rolling around the scenes and looking frightened around like they had no clue what to do on the scene... I think this is a beautiful example of Bottom 100 picture.',neg
'George Sluizer of THE VANISHING fame ( He made both the haunting European original and the Hollywood remake ) directed CRIMETIME . He shouldnt really be blamed for this confused  poor movie because all the problems lie in Brendan Somers script . Its ill focused and lazily written . For instance the killer hangs around a nightclub waiting to pick up a victim  any victim and starts talking to a teenage girl . Cut to the next scene where she tells the villain  Ive told you everything about myself  tell me about your life ?  Unfortunately the girl has told the baddie her life story off screen and is a terrible example of the screenwriter not being able to bring a character to life through dialogue . I know for a fact how bloody difficult this is but for a screenplay that is produced the writer should have tried harder <br /><br />Its difficult to explain the message of the film . At some points it feels like its trying to be a British NATURAL BORN KILLERS satarising the medias voyeurism with crime ( Perhaps it even influenced the infamous video game MANHUNT ) but the script isnt witty enough to carry this off . When youve got a sex scene that doesnt progress the plot or characters or hint of subtext you know youve got a badly written screenplay and CRIMETIME is a badly written screenplay',neg
'This movie was terrible. The plot sucked the acting was bad the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out. I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie back. The balloon scene was stupid the Mormon jokes are really old the soundtrack sucked I saw no chemistry between the two leads its full of stereotypes stupid local celeb cameos..most noted was Del Im going to drive as fast as I want to.. computer idiot. What is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed that up. This movie help create a long line of lackluster efforts to mainstream LDS beliefs into Hollywood. I.E. The RM Church ball etc. etc. I would forgo watching this movie and instead run head first into a brick wall. You will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show.',neg
'Set in the mid 1800s when the British is clearing New Zealand outback wilderness to establish colonies. The daughter of a British army surgeon Sarah(Samantha Morton) falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. The Maori is an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people for the Europeans to deal with. By the time Sarahs child which she calls Boy is born his father is dead. By the age of six Boy is kidnapped by his fathers family and Sarah will begin her search for him with a man(Kiefer Sutherland)who is deeply in love with her.<br /><br />Two-time Oscar nominee Morton is definitely the star of this movie. Sutherland is a total waste. Also starring are: Cliff Curtis Stephen Rea Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Pene. This movie is rated R for some sexual content and violent battle scenes. I find the title RIVER QUEEN very misleading and the DVD cover with Sutherland only and making you believe he is the leading star should be a crime.',neg
'I just watched this movie on its premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) Mork & Mindy as a kid mostly for Robin Williams zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But of course the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robins journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. And my hat is off to star Chris Diamantopoulos as he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity sensitivity and heart; not just a cute impression although it was even dead-on. (On an unrelated note I noticed that Robins struggles were in some ways similar to Andy Kaufman who was under-appreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively but thats the Taxi behind the scenes biopic.)<br /><br />All in all this was a very enjoyable flick in which I felt I got to know a little more of the man behind the Orkan. The acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like I suspected- and the story moved along well. Performances that were particularly good were by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi heckles Robin was a hoot!). Not a great masterpiece by any means (I would have liked to have seen a tad more about Pam Dawber) but definitely watchable especially for those Robin Williams and Mork & Mindy fans out there. Nanoo nanoo!',pos
'Okay now I know there are millions of Americans who believe in The Rapture: that moment when all people born again in Christ will be raptured up to meet God and all the rest of humanity will be left on earth to perish in plagues and fire and the heartbreak of psoriasis as the Antichrist battles it out with Jesus (in an uncharacteristically warlike mode). And I know the books were best sellers. . .among believers anyway. And I mean no disrespect to all that.<br /><br />But I have to say they stuffed this movie into a sack and beat it with the Suck Stick.<br /><br />Im sure the books are much better. Really.<br /><br />The plot needs no reprising. If youve watched this movie chances are you read the book. I may be one of the only people on earth who actually watched this just for the sheer bad-moving-making experience and I wasnt disappointed. Especially not by Kirk Cameron the creepy little Growing Pains gremlin who came of age on that show found Christ and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well Kirk your career has gone to the dogs but now you can be happy that youre spreading the word of God in movies so bad they never even make it to theatrical release. Well thats not strictly true: I guess this was the only movie ever made that went to DVD FIRST with a voucher for a free viewing of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters! I still have the voucher! How many people do you suppose showed up? I dont know about you but it never came to my town. Of course I live in NYC where we Godless liberals sit around tearing pages out of the bible and use them to roll joints. So there you go. In fact Ill bet out of three million people on Manhattan Island not one would be raptured.<br /><br />Check out the supplementary materials on the DVD where youll learn the creepy behind the scenes details of these movies. . .the CAST and CREW all must be of the same religious mindset. They dont come right out and say this but listen closely to what the filmmakers say. Its like a bunch of Pod People got together to make a Pod movie. How creepazoid is that? Honestly this stuff just preaches to the converted doesnt it? Can you imagine anyone who DOESNT subscribe to the whole apocalypse thing watching this slapping his forehead and saying HOLY HOOVER DAM! I better get saved PRONTO! Anyhow Im hooked. I gotta see the rest of these Christian fiasco movies especially the one with Gary Busey which I think is TRIBULATIONS. At least Busey has an excuse for taking the part.. . .he cracked his head on some pavement when he crashed his motorcycle.<br /><br />Oy.<br /><br />Oh and one more thing. Whats with all the shots of poorinnocent dogs whimpering their leashes dragging uselessly along the ground because their owners have been called to heaven? Whats up with that? Are we supposed to feel badly for the dogs and if we do what are we to make of God? Doesnt it IRK people that theres no room in heaven for mans best friend?

'I saw this movie on VHS some time ago (27 Jan 2003) just because of the name of Paul Rudd on the cover. I liked his performance in `The Object of My Affection very much and I really expected a good work. However I found this film a complete mess. The story has a very confused screenplay and the characters are not well developed. Further the low-budget special effects do not help much.

'Simply put Oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It is filled with memorable songs - Food Glorious Food Oliver! Consider Yourself and Oom-Pah-Pah to name just a few - and equally memorable characters.<br /><br />The film is a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens classic novel and much like the story of Oliver Twist itself it is a perfect family film. There are some frightening moments - the villain Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed is scary enough on his own - but overall the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults.<br /><br />The story - which almost everyone is surely familiar with by now - revolves around a little orphan boy named Oliver and his life growing up in London. At first he lives in the workhouse with the rest of his fellow orphans but after daring to question Mr. Bumble the overseer he is sold to a family as a servant.<br /><br />After a series of mishaps and close shaves he meets the Artful Dodger - superbly played by a young Jack Wild who gives his all in the role - and through him the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody) who trains young boys to pick pocket treasures which he keeps for himself.<br /><br />The film was shot solely in studios and on soundstages at Shepperton Film Studios but this does not translate at all to film. The sets perfectly replicate Victorian London as do the costumes worn by the characters. A multi-Oscar winner and a massive success on its release Oliver! is a worthy contender for the best musical all of time and will delight anyone who loves film.',pos
'On October of 1945 the American German descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in a post-war Frankfurt and his bitter Uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) gets a job for him in the Zentropa train line as a sleeping car conductor. While traveling in the train learning his profession he sees the destructed occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa) the daughter of the former powerful entrepreneur of transport business and owner of Zentropa Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold stays neutral between the allied forces and the Germans and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called Werewolves killing the sympathizers of the allied and conducting subversive actions against the allied forces. He falls in love for Katharina and sooner she discloses that she was a Werewolf. When Max commits suicide Leopold is also pressed by the Werewolves and need to take a position and a decision.<br /><br />Europa is an impressive and anguishing Kafkanian story of the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an expressionist style that recalls Fritz Lang and alternating a magnificent black & white cinematography with some colored details this movie discloses a difficult period of Germany and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war. Very impressive the action of the occupation forces destroying resources that could permit a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country and the corruption with the Jew that should identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody. The hypnotic narration of Max Von Sydow is another touch of class in this awarded film. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Europa',pos
'I only today picked this up at the 99 cents only store today and I still think I got ripped off. Dream to Believe is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $1 is just too freakin expensive for this. This film is probably only notable for 2 things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. Its directed by Paul Lynch the man who also did Promo Night. Now onto the movie. <br /><br />Its about a girl named Robin (Played by Olivia DAbo) who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her fathers life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named Tommy (Played by Keanu.) Robin when not in training works part-time along with her mother and stepsister at a Laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather. Eventually she is chosen to compete. <br /><br />Overall Keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star and its also not one of the worst movies ever but still far from good. The DVD itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old VHS and towards the end the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over it fades to black even though sound can still be heard. So this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie as its also not in the movie itself so the covers obviously photoshopped. In any case avoid at all costs unless youre a Keanu fanatic. I probably wont be hanging to it any longer. Im probably gonna give it to The Cinema Snob whos a great YT critic btw. Hey if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight feel free to donate to him to keep his show running.',neg

The only thing I regret is I cant find the sound track or the DVD in the stores??...anyone care to shed some light or must I order it from some over priced internet company. But getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time Hazel/Kate had something to say about 80s Britain..actually it was the same decade I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons one being Thatcher and what she was doing to the country at the time.

'This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourettes syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine now Cartman has Tourettes syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like hes faking. Cartman is certainly on fire saying whatever he wants to the teachers to the principal to anybody. On the other hand we have Kyle who now is the intolerant one basically for saying that Cartman was faking he was taken to meet children with Tourettes syndrome just to let him see that Tourettes syndrome is for real and is great since Kyle is like well maybe someone is faking to have Tourettes for fun in short Kyle could not explain that Cartman was faking. Probably my favourite scene of this episode is when Cartman is with Kyles family but right after this scene another kid fins that Cartman is simply faking the kid with Tourettes who was at the toy store Cartman basically said to that kid this: isnt having Tourettes awesome. But to be saying whatever he wants and be for everybody a brave boy is sort of just the beginning for Cartman his master plan: going on National TV to say anything he wants (people will call it brilliant TV theyll probably give me an Emmy- fantastic in this episode the word s*** is used 26 times and certainly thats not all. South Park won an Emmy like a month or so before this episode aired). But here theres a twist Cartman basically removed all the bricks of the wall he says now everything without thinking so we hear from Cartman that he wet his bed last night now is not fun for Cartman and he is like I cant control what I say and certainly the person who was with him is like well of course you cant control what you say you have Tourettes so Cartman is like my Tourettes has gotten worse before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff but now its gotten really bad. There is also stuff about Chris Hansen and To Catch a Predator actually what happened with a pervert here happens with a lot more perverts Kyle and Thomas were behind that to stop Cartman Kyle ends being Cartmans saviour! Fantastic!<br /><br />TSA VOICES CONCERN Over South Park October 3rd Episode <br /><br />On Wednesday October 3 the cable network Comedy Central will air an episode of the animated series South Park in which one of the young characters Cartman gets Tourette Syndrome. Given the nature of this program we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with TS and garner numerous calls and emails from our members and the TS community.<br /><br />We have already taken some pre-emptive strikes such as requesting that Comedy Central air our Public Service Announcement (featuring comedian Richard Lewis) during or after the show. In addition once the episode airs and we are able to see exactly how TS is portrayed we will be able to respond with specific issues and problems we have with the show to the writers.<br /><br />We are actually surprised it took the creators so long to use TS as comedy fodder in this program since no disability illness or controversial topic is off limits to them said Judit Ungar President TSA.<br /><br />We always see portrayals of TS (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education and a show of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for TSA to spread factual information about the disorder said Tracy Colletti- Flynn Manager of Public Relations and Communications TSA.<br /><br />We will be posting an official statement on this site with TSAs reaction to the program after the show airs.<br /><br />TSA RESPONDS to South Park Episode <br /><br />Unfortunately as has been the case with far too many media portrayals of people with Tourette Syndrome (TS) the season opener of South Park (Le Petit Tourette 10-3-07) served to perpetuate even further the outright myth that most of those affected by TS have involuntary outbursts of foul language. In point of fact fully 85-90\% of people with TS never experience this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom (medically termed coprolalia). For viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder the misleading take away message couldnt have been clearer  unless you curse you dont have TS. <br /><br />Despite our pre-airing trepidations we do concede that the episode was surprisingly well- researched. The highly exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia notwithstanding for the attentive viewer there was a surprising amount of accurate information conveyed. The scripted input from parents a neurologist peers and the therapy session with the TS childrens support group all served as a clever device for providing these facts to the public. No doubt this South Park episode did generate increased national awareness about TS. Nevertheless we are very concerned that school children with TS will be mocked and even bullied by insensitive peers who may have seen the program said Judit Ungar TSA President. We realize that for over a decade the writers satirical parodies have spared no group be they celebrities the disabled or political figures. The fact that TS was the subject of a popular TV show attests to the fact that the public is so much more aware of the disorder. Obviously this increased awareness weve worked too hard to accomplish can at times prove to be a double-edged sword. <br /><br />TSA contacted the programs executives prior to the airing and we will be in touch with them again. Perhaps well succeed in turning this into an opportunity for positive TS awareness.',pos
'The great talents of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful A Matter of Life and Death. It was part of the recent tribute to Mr. Powell that played at the Walter Reade in New York. This film in particular shows us one of the best British films from that or any other era.<br /><br />A Matter of Life and Death has a brilliant cinematography by Jack Cardiff a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera. Particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth. This was quite a coup and well ahead of its times. The black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where Peter and the Conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any film.<br /><br />Much has been said in this forum about the film so our comment will be about the great acting Powell and Pressberger got out of the large distinguished cast who responded magnificently to the directors guidance.<br /><br />David Niven is Peter whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it. This film marked one of the highlights in Mr. Nivens career. He was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie. Kim Hunter is surprisingly good as June the woman who talked to Peter as his plane was falling from the skies. As fate would have it Peter and June fall in love at first sight.<br /><br />Some of the best British film actors grace this film with their presence. Robert Coote is Bob the man who is admitted to heaven but he is surprised his friend Peter never made the trip with him. An excellent star turn by Marius Goring who as the Conductor 71 steals the film. Mr. Goring who had worked with the directors is one of the best things in the movie. Also Roger Livesey as Dr. Frank Reeves does one of the best appearances of his career as well as Raymond Massey who is seen as Abraham Farlan.<br /><br />A Matter of Life and Death is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators.',pos
'The United States of Leland was an amazing movie. I kept passing it on the guide on my TV not knowing what it was and never having the chance to sit there and get into it. Then one morning when I woke up early I saw that it was just about to start. So I decided to watch it. I had the time and interest to watch it. When I saw that Ryan Gosling was in the movie and then that he was the main character I was immediately sucked in and could not move from my couch. The struggle that Leland goes through is such an inspiring story. Everyone has to deal with the same type of thoughts throughout sometime in their life whether it be a small minor detail or something as big as what hes going through. I have to sit and watch the movie again just to catch all the stuff that I may have missed the first time around. As a general comment... I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Gosling fan or anyone who just likes a good movie with a real good story. The fact that there are so many other big stars who all also had great performances is just an added BONUS! So do what you can to take the time to check out this movie I can almost be sure it wont be a waste of time.',pos
'Oliver Stone always ready to make politically-themed movies makes another one here. Talk Radio is loosely based on the career of Alan Berg a radio talk show host in Denver who was murdered by white supremacists. In this case the character is Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian) an outspoken talk show host in Dallas who loves nothing more than to irk the people who call in. As it is most of the people who call in are a bunch of pigheaded racists. And things may be heating up more than anyone realizes.<br /><br />Bogosians performance brings a light comical tone to an otherwise serious movie. I really liked the scene where he jabs at a redneck who calls in. Granted I wouldnt call this Oliver Stones greatest movie ever but its a good reference in an era when media gets more and more concentrated. Good performances by Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help.',pos
'This movie was a fantastic comedy. It had a lot of comedians star in it like Akshay KumarRajpal YadavParesh Raval and John Abraham.<br /><br />Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars wife and so were all the air hostesses. Mr Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham cheats on his work he becomes Akshay Kumars senior and Akshay Kumar gets really jealous because his flat has to be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia starts liking John more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham so he finds a flat and he is going out with three different girls (Nitu ChandraNargis BagheriDaisy Boppana).',pos
'This show is like watching someone who is in training to someday host a show. There are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre ones. It doesnt look like the writers know the difference between whats funny and whats just weird or gross.<br /><br />It has its moments. When Spike hosed down a neighbor who had been letting her dog soil his lawn repeatedly it hit its peak. But the hilarious moments are too few and theres too many experimental comedy bits that miss the mark.<br /><br />The shows better than say watching a test pattern or the QVC network but it needs some better writers.<br /><br />Reading the glowingly positive IMDb comments on this show I am convinced that most of them were written by show staffers and by relatives and personal friends of Spike.<br /><br />It just isnt very good most of the time.',neg
'It follows BLOCK-HEADS and A CHUMP AT OXFORD two films that are hard to top. Not that SAPS AT SEA is a bad film - it is the last good comedy (unless one insists on JITTERBUGS or another of the later films) that Laurel & Hardy made. Its just that it is a toss-off little film without the crazy destructive crescendo of BLOCK-HEADS or the astounding sight of Stans real personality in A CHUMP AT OXFORD to revel in. At 57 minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit but that actually is not a bad point for it. It has just enough time to it to hit the right notes. Its just not as special as the other two.<br /><br />Stan and Ollie work in a factory that manufactures horns. I suspect that there was a bit of Chaplin influence in this sequence (one recalls a similar assembly-line incident in MODERN TIMES only four years earlier). Ollies nerves finally snap and he goes on a rampage. He goes home and (naturally) his roommate Stan does not help - Stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his instrument (youve got it - a trombone). After beating up the poor professor Ollie has problems with the incompetent janitor/engineer (Ben Turpin in a nice brief appearance) and then faces his doctor (Jimmy Finleyson) and his nerve tester (a balloon that inflates as you push air out of Ollies stomach). Finleyson announces that it is a bad case of horniphobia and Ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and goats milk. They end up going to a ship but Ollie and Stan know nothing about seamanship - so they plan to sleep on the ship. Unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off. Also unfortunately on board is Richard Cramer an escaped dangerous criminal. This is not going to be a peaceful vacation.<br /><br />SAPS AT SEA (like A CHUMP) could have been three shorts one at the factory one at the apartment and one on the boat. Each would have been a successful short and they all make a funny film - but the stitching of the parts together shows. There are some very amusing moments in the film - the discoveries of how Turpins ineptitude causes various mishaps with water taps and stoves in the apartment; the accidental remarks of building manager Charlie Hall when Stan or Ollie runs by him and asks for directions (Can you help me find the basement? asks Stan - Certainlyyou cant miss it - its downstairs! says Hall who realizes what a stupid comment he just made); and Cramers mistreatment of his two hostage slaves. He calls Ollie Dizzy and Stan Daffy (an allusion to the Dean Brothers of the St. Louis Cardinal teams of the 1930s - see Dan Daileys THE PRIDE OF ST. LOUIS). Cramer has the boys cook him up some food - and they make a synthetic meal (boot laces for spaghetti for instance) to get him sick to be overpowered. When he realizes what they have done he forces them to eat the meal themselves. Their reactions are brilliant.<br /><br />SAPS AT SEA is not on par with the top line of Laurel & Hardy films but it is a good film on the whole and a good conclusion to the best years of their film career (1927 - 1940) when they were with Hal Roach. In the immediate couple of years before it appeared the boys and Roach had serious problems involving production costs (OUR RELATIONS where Stan was producer on the film) artistic problems (scenes from SWISS MISS were cut meaninglessly) and contractual arguments (leading to Ollie appearing with Harry Langdon in ZENOBIA). Stan and Ollie hit back with THE FLYING DEUCES wherein the production was not Roachs but Boris Morros. At last a two picture deal of A CHUMP AT OXFORD and SAPS AT SEA concluded the arguments and problems - and on a high note the boys left Roach. Unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been.',pos
'This movie was promising: my favorite actor in a historical drama during the Independence war. It had memories from Dances With Wolves for the big prairies Indians military fights & from Barry Lyndon for the British & candles lights atmospheres...<br /><br />Unfortunately the script is awful: the continuity of the story is lacking (cuts with 5 months later; 3 years later) & the romance is so ridiculous that its hard to believe in it: America is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other; Above all wait for the ending & you understand how to kill a story (imagine the same in Titanic).<br /><br />Sometimes a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker. Unfortunately bis Hudson is a poor one. He has already committed Greystoke and i find again the same flaws: no dynamic in scenes in editing in scoring: it is long dull flat....<br /><br />I knew that this movie was a disaster for Pacinos career: now i understand. Finally this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me: A painful one...',neg
'While the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film; it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth.<br /><br />The case is the use of the soundtrack music: a mix of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber that plays constantly and loudly and would have made Max Steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult; how ecstatic; how tortured it is to be an artist. And then it really counts the story elides the details at the end.<br /><br />This heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by Peter Ackroyd about a Yukio Mishima book: This is not writing this is Barbara Cartland. Precisely the same critique can be made of this film: a deceptive mawkish vanity project.',neg
'Others have harped here about James Stewarts age when playing Lindburg (he was 47 Linburg was twenty five.) But Stewart does not look his age and the film for him was a dream come true. An actual pilot and a retired Air Force Reserve General at the end of his life Stewart had the feel for the character and understanding of his passion which other actors could not bring to the role. Added to the cast was co-star Murray Hamilton who was also to be featured in The F.B.I. story with Stewart) and such other well known character actors as Richard Deacon of the later Dick Van Dike Show and Robert Cornthwaite of The Thing from Another World the 1951 Sci-Fi classic.<br /><br />Billy Wilder captures the flavor of the Lindburg Autobiography and the telling of what was to become a major event in the history of aviation. This story and film are a testament to the soul of determination and perseverance to realize a dream. A box office failure at the time of its release it has since become one of the great classics of American Film and another in a long line of outstanding performances by an actor that has been called Americas Everyman. No student of film history should miss seeing this one. There have been over 500000 films since the beginning of motion pictures and this one belongs among the top 500.',pos
'Normally I love finding old (and some not-so-old) westerns I havent seen to be the entertainment for the evening. Its such a great way to sit back relax and escape the politics and world problems for a few hours. But this was not to be the case with this version of The Magnificent Seven. The casting and storyline of this series closely follow the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; good old get-your-mind-right revisionist history where the bad guys must all be white male Confederate (in this case) and preferably Christian (if it can somehow be worked into the script). Its sad really. The best movies out there are now and have always been about simply telling a good story up on the big screen - not about forwarding someones political ideology.',neg
'As a Long Island independent film maker myself and having have had two theatrical releases under my producing/directing belt I had always been told of how much I could learn by viewing a FRED CARPENTER production so I was lucky enough to have his Eddie Monroe as my initiation to his superb budgeting production casting settings and masterful directing talents. My heart went out to its characters its story and was totally won over by the trick/switch ending that brought the films plot to fruition! Locations were marvelously chosen and human emotions in its characters brought a realistic link to my bonding with all the elements that Mr Carpenter utilized throughout to his and his films benefit!',pos
'Way too many Christian films become centered around the fear of the Judgment and as a result come across as condescending and indeliberately cheesy. Second Glance gets it right. This is a near perfect evangelical tool; it deals with the real reason why so many young people want nothing to do with Christianity. It assures viewers that one must give up their sin--not their fun--to succeed in the Christian lifestyle. Second Glance even works as a piece of film-making. The filmmakers obviously were working on a very low budget but they managed to write a script dynamic enough to divert viewers attention from this obvious fact. This film brought me to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and thanks to Christian stations everywhere which show it it surely has impacted more people than just me.',pos

'well Id probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie cos honestly i thought it was such a piece of crap i mean the actors had done a terrible acting job and the script was all terrible. Although the special effects wasnt a bit bad but i think the should have thought a lot harder than that. I mean how did Clara Bryant get successfully put into this film i mean shed do a lot better if she looked a bit further and that goes the same with Kristen honey i mean her character dies and she doesnt bother to try and defend herself i mean its gotta be a total joke. She should at least do a lot better than what she an do like become a soldier or more of a heroine or something along the lines of bravery. But the point is the actors did a complete soulless lousy job and so did the director and the writer who made this film. they shouldve went into film school to think up some better ideas and i hope everyone agrees with my methods cos they are probably thinking the same thing.',neg
'This documentary is rife with problems.<br /><br />How arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family? I understand you think the subject is interesting. I was bored with it. This isnt a fascinating story to me and I dont know why you would think it was.<br /><br />I dont want to come off as mean but I have to say: Most of the people in this film are just not attractive. And thats OK not everyone is pretty. But your camera technique to stick the lens in their face so you cant help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it is filling your 47 TV is not enjoyable. I had to put my hand up half the time to shield myself from the warts wrinkles bags under eyes and yellow teeth. Really Im trying not to sound inhuman but pull the camera back so its not like total strangers are breathing in my face.<br /><br />The camera work in this film is rank amateur level. Its the kind of camera work you see from everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic. Uninteresting framing unsteady even static shots are done carelessly. Put a little effort into it if youre going to do this for a living.<br /><br />I honestly cant see what the big deal is about this thing.',neg
'Lets cut through everything in the first paragraph. The Messengers the newest film by the Pang Brothers (Danny and Oxide) as a horror movie is profoundly bad. And just as a movie in general is a big disappointment. Its nothing but a rewarmed Sixth Sense and as long as that picture is still available there is no reason on Earth to pay money to see this turkey.<br /><br />Lately horror/slasher films such as the Final Destination series Wrong Turn Boogie Man The Ring 2 and The Grudge are becoming increasingly more reliant on big shocks with no payoff (for instance something jumps out at the person on screen elicits a gasp from the audience but turns out to be a cat or a crow or something.) Little goes into making it a genuine frightening experience like The Sixth Sense or Signs or some of the classic horror movies of the 1940s 50s and 60s.<br /><br />The Messengers relies upon the same old tired clichés as these newer far inferior films and is therefor old tired and - to my surprise - ended up as one of the most boring movies I have seen in awhile.<br /><br />The plot has another stupid family led by dad Roy (Dylan McDermott The Practice) mom Denise (Penelope Ann Miller Awakenings Kindergarten Cop TV series Desperate Housewives) big sis Jess (Kristen Stewart Zathura: A Space Adventure) and toddler Ben (Evan Turner) who move to North Dakota from Chicago.<br /><br />The reason for the move is never really outlined here but it has something to do with the dads inability to find work and Jess drunken driving escapades. We know there will be trouble immediately because they move into a big Gothic house in the middle of nowhere; a domicile that looks like the Munsters summer home. Oh and the first five minutes of the movie show something really horrible happened there.<br /><br />Jess hates the place (hey who could blame her) but optimistic pop hopes to make a go out of raising sunflowers (despite the unusually large amount of crows fluttering about). But when he meets Burwell (John Corbet Raising Helen and looking like Kevin Costner in the film version of My Name Is Earl) an itinerant drifter and expert on raising sunflowers things start to pick up.<br /><br />But then weird things begin to happen; Jess is terrorized by a violent unseen force in the house (of course no one else but the two-year-old Ben can see it so shes labeled a flake) and the crows keep hanging around. Ben also is able to detect the unearthly creatures but since hes two he cannot articulate it. Scene after scene of people telling the little boy to tell them what he sees finally had me wanting to yell to the screen He cant tell you! Hes two - freaking - years old! Yes have the only protagonist who can solve all of these things be a mute toddler is real smart. <br /><br />Anyway were left to ponder the sanity of Jess; when and if Ben will ever properly describe the paranormal visions he sees; if dad will make the sunflower thing work; if the high plains drifter is a good guy or bad; what the point of the George Plimpton-looking Realtor is; how a pitchfork plunged in the back can only be a flesh wound; what moms role in the family is; and where are all the crows coming from.<br /><br />All of this while waiting and wondering for something - anything - to happen. The conclusion is really lame as well and once again begs the question of how a spirit which has no physical body can cause harm to a living person. Very dull pointless and most terrible of all not frightening in the least.<br /><br />Oh and there are a lot of crows in this movie.',neg
'Demi and Woody are married but theyre poor. They meet Robert Redford and hes REALLY rich. He takes a fancy to Demi and since hes a gambling man he makes the couple an indecent proposal: one million dollars for a night with the little woman.<br /><br />At this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep. Of course Demi is going to accept the offer. If she doesnt theres no first half of the movie. Of course it will affect Demi and Woodys marriage. If it doesnt theres no second half of the movie. And of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll. If it doesnt theres no happy ending for the sake of box office.<br /><br />The absolute best thing you can say about INDECENT PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore looks good in a black dress. As for the rest... The script is incompetent the direction amateurish the performances negligible. I suspect Redford Moore and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned. Do them--and more importantly yourself--a favor. Unless some one offers you a million... Miss It!<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer',neg
'Starting off heres a synopsis: Porno queen Alta Lee (Lynn Lowry) is murdered by her pornographer lover Max (George Shannon) in a game of sexual Russian roulette. Altas other lover icy lesbian casting agent Camila Stone (Mary Woronov) provides an alibi for Max. But Camila has an agenda of her own and a plan involving the seduction of innocent actress Julie (Lynn again) in a web of sexual mind games. When the lookalikes identities are sufficiently blurred the stage is set for vengeance as passionate as the most heated carnal encounter.<br /><br />Though this movie is quite obscure and never got much attention I find it to be a sexy suspenseful gem. Cult goddess Woronov has one of her best-ever roles and she and sexy-innocent Lowry play off each other well. The unsettling music provided by Gershon Kingsley plus two original songs (All-American Boy You Say Youve Never Let Me Down) and the Jaynetts Sally Go Round the Roses compose a memorable soundtrack. Theodore Gershunys direction is sharp with everything photographed in muted earth tones that perfectly suggest unsavory business bubbling under societys upper crust. With tons of great New York atmosphere Ondine (Woronovs friend and fellow Warholite) giving a great performance in a small role and exotic Monique Van Vooren as Maxs ex-wife in a comic sub-plot. This sub-plot though amusing looks like it belongs in another movie altogether. However Im not complaining as the film is smooth even as it changes gears and is a hell of a lot more interesting that the erotic-thriller garbage currently being cranked out.<br /><br />Trivia: Sugar Cookies was originally rated X (soft-core) and released by General Film Corporation in 1973. I am the proud owner of an original one-sheet poster--lucky me! In 1977 the movie was cut for an R and re-released by Troma Team which now offers it uncut on videotape. Mary Woronov was the wife of Theodore Gershuny at the time and was reportedly uncomfortable performing the graphic lesbian simulated sex scenes with him leering behind the camera. She can also be seen in two of his earlier productions Kemek (1970) and Silent Night Bloody Night (1972).',pos
'Although I had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie this sure as hell wasnt what I would have had in mind had anything actually come to mind. Once I heard of its existence all I knew was that I had to own a movie called Please Dont Eat The Babies. unfortunately I could only find a copy under its alternate title Island Fury. Looking back I guess I could call it a lose-lose situation. On one hand I still dont get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called Please Dont Eat The Babies and on the other hand Island Fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful pointless boring unwatchable piece of garbage. Yeah definitely lose-lose.<br /><br />Im not even sure what genre theyre going for here. Just early 80s badness with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non-flashback. First up two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys once caught the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string around her neck and somehow these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere. And this is where things start to get weird somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island years earlier when they were only 10. I guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is. So now were in the past while the girls try to retrace their steps so these bad guys dont kill them although I wouldnt have minded if they had. In the flashback the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends eventually stopping by an island for some air they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents. Any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up but the flashback was undeniably better than the present which still isnt saying much.<br /><br />For a while there I had forgotten about the original story At one point I Ithought maybe the director had too and when the flashback ended that would be the end which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half-hour shorter. This pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end and real stuff does happen but its stupid. I guess I didnt exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured or anything like that but I did expect some form of outlandish B-entertainment mostly just a confusing inept storyline unsure of its genre. My advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like Attack Of The Beast Creatures. If anyone I would only recommend this one to serious B-movie collectors who must have them all anyone else interested probably has brain damage. What really gets me is that I still have no idea why they called it Please Dont Eat The Babies. 3/10',neg
'Well how was I suppose to know this was the dumb ass promotional Lordi Motion Picture? I mean I realized this when that dinosaur costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance I was humming Hard Rock Hallelujah to myself... even though I hate that song. Dark Floors is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they and the rest of the people in that particular elevator become momentarily trapped... When they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around. The hospital is empty... Except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason... They run through the hallways and stairwells encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish shock-rock costumes... Nothing really memorable here except the lousy acting lack of gore/nudity and the utterly shameless promotional edge reminding me very much of KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park. Yeah remember that dud? Wish I didnt... I would just recommend avoiding all of these Ghost House films like a fungus and not listen to Lordi since they are a Gwar ripoff band!',neg
'Ok so theres always people out there that seem to make it a point not to like movies because theyre good but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be or whether theyre from a foreign country. All that aside One Crazy Summer is the perfect example of what a great American teen comedy should be. The jokes are a good mix of slapstick (a la Bobcat Goldthwait) surreal (Bobcat under the inspired direction of Steve Holland) and dry (John Cusack one of the most morosely dry and funny actors in American cinema) and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line (ok except Demi Moore).<br /><br />Yes its immature yes its screw-ball yes Bobcat dresses up like Godzilla and trashes a scale-model of a seafood restaurant.

'This movie certainly proves that also the good Americans can do terribly good propaganda. No questions being asked no comments being made on power abuse or police terror when James Stewart solid and convincing as always solves all the stories from Dillinger to 5th Column more or less singlehandedly.

Not to speak of civil rights which are never broken or homes which are never intruded. And if the FBI service would not be enough Steward also gives his sons life for the country in WW II. Perfectly made if you wouldnt know better....',neg
'I have two good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). However that said I found this film extremely tiresome. Watching paint dry would have been more entertaining. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Beginning with opening sequence where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything thats said to him on the phone the movie is annoying. The film is filled with clichés and shtick not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. Also the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. There are some sequences that are touching but theyre all played for laughs. If schmaltzy sentimental and cute appeal to you youll love it. But if you were hoping for something with more substance see a different movie.',neg
'The second in director Cohens trilogy of Second World War comedies (the others being Till Death Do Us Part and `Adolf Hitler - My Part In His Downfall) is a film version of the BBCs long running (and much loved) situation comedy. Like most transfers of television shows this movie suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches. Some of which work better than others for example the scene where a high ranking army officer floats down a river is a memorable surreal moment.<br /><br />The joy of this movie is its representation of a past that probably never existed and an England which is defined by picturesque countryside and the chance it offers to see veteran scene-stealers such as John Le Mesurier given their biggest film roles. Arthur Lowe is superb as Captain Mainwaring a bungler who when the chips are down displays great courage and saves the day (the climax is probably the characters greatest moment).<br /><br />Episodes of the television series are of course funnier but as an introduction to a British legend you cannot find anything better.',pos

And that`s the problem with this film version you`ll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show . In fact the whole idea of making a film version of BILKO without Silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage',neg
'Worst movie of all time? Wow whoa now. You cannot be serious.<br /><br />Maybe its all about what you expect a movie to do to you. I live in Oregon so I got to enjoy the beautifully-filmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful Smith Rocks and other areas in Central Oregon (as well as the sweet cameo of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs looking down on baby Sissys cradle at the beginning of the movie). Those alone were enough to spur me to give the movie a better than average score.<br /><br />Or .... Maybe its all about what expectations you have. Having read the book AGES ago and thinking to myself goodness no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting quirky weird book ... especially 20 years later when mores (MORAYS -- cant put in the accent mark online) have changed -- I was actually quite pleasantly surprised when I first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it again.<br /><br />Sissy was exquisitely cast and I dont care what you all say I was also pleasantly surprised at Rain Phoenixs and John Hurts performances. I am not a lesbian nor bi nor trans but have met many folks who are similar to the folks they were supposed to portray -- and those real folks kinda acted the same way as these actors acted. Stilted a bit stage-ey -- always a bit on. Gus Van Sant is one weird native Oregonian but by garsh he done a good job adapting this crazy book IMHO.',pos
'I dont see why all the people are giving this film negative reviews?!?! I loved this movie! Bled is a form of abstract art and if you dont appreciate art I can see why you would not like this film. It was a great twist from the average played out vampire movie. If you are looking for a fresh new and ingenious new vampire movie then this is for you. But if you want one of those turn into bats wolves and melt in the sunlight movies then go watch your old played out Dracula flicks. Sure it is a bit on the low budget side but they did a great job with the budget they had. Im very happy that I found this movie because I was about to give up on the vampire genre fro good. I thought this film was brilliant! I give 2 thumbs up to the writer director and everyone involved in the film.',pos
'Saw this piece of work at a film fest in CA. My god what was the director thinking? Film professors should use this film as a case study on what NOT to do when making a short film. First off this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The film takes place partially in The Waystation some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere where nothing really takes place.<br /><br />THe acting is beyond bad. So bad in fact that I almost thought it was a comedy. The lead actress Julia Reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films. There is one or two decent performances including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner but its like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians. The only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue which bordered on absurd. The writer (whom I assume is also the director) writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain.<br /><br />The overall production value is pretty good but to be honest with a film this bad its easy to overlook it. The production design is pretty good although the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar. The costumes and make-up are okay and I understand the production was working with a low budget. Its just when the characters speak or they try and push the plot forward the film unravels into a muck of crap.<br /><br />As Ive said this film is god awful. Its like the director/writer watched a lot of sci-fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this. My only hope is that he used other peoples money on this because if he used his own hes a total sucker.',neg
'I kind of like JAG. It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.<br /><br />I don´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents.

'This could have been a good episode but I simply had to turn it off. The British representation was horrible to watch. Have the makers ever set foot in Britain prior to filming? At least set foot in England?? I dont think any British person have had such an accent apart from a comedy skit of The Royal Family! Also with the 2 English boys... well I dont think any English boy has acted spoke or dressed like any English kid in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harrys preteen public appearances. To American film makers.. There is more than 1 country in the UK. England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland.. meaning more than 1 culture!

'The premise is interesting and the cast does the best it can but the script and the directorial effort are so poor that it is not surprising that this film was buried--which is fitting given the screenplay. As I watched this I could not decide which was worse the screenplay or the directing. The actors are over the top the art direction looks like a Disney movie the music is contrived and the sentiment so sweet that it gives viewers cavities. Its a bad attempt to imitate FOur Weddings And A funeral. If one wants to watch comedy that is as flat as a pancake and how poor direction can turn a story into cavity sweetness this is a good one to watch.',neg
'It is obviously illegal. Pedophiles pray on stuff like this. How did they get away with making such a movie? This movie is all summed up in one word SICK. Where do people get off making and watching these kinds of films. As I was watching the movie I didnt actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe 12 if that actually sleep with this woman. Sorry if this is a spoiler to you but I would have rater not seen this. Where has the sanity of these people gone? Maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles? Our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior. I noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked. This is a kid here and someone is asking something like this? What is wrong with this picture?',neg
'Many reviews Ive read reveals that most people tend to like Part One better than Part Two. I feel exactly the opposite. Part One played around a bit much with trying to find different ways of showing Che Guevaras personality through different types of film stock different locations and cutting back and forth between an interview and the Cuban revolution. For the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting. In Part Two Che enters Bolivia and along with changing geographical location the rules and the structure changes. Gone are the spacial jumps and switching between stocks the documentary realism and the treatises. Instead now we are literally trapped with Che in a desaturated depopulated landscape where the only people who exist are burdened too far with their lives for anything but survival to be an option. I posit that its the dark turn of Ches life that is the real reason why most people prefer Part One to Part Two.<br /><br />The change in geographic location also signifies for me at least that Che: Part One and Che: Part Two are in fact the second two acts of a three act structure begun by Motorcycle Diaries. Motorcycle Diaries is Ches coming-of-age (or more appropriately coming-of-ideals) in Argentina Che: Part One is his military leadership in Cuba and Che: Part Two is his downfall in Bolivia. These movies do not completely illustrate his life (were missing his experiences in Guatamala and more importantly in my opinion his post-Cuban revolution executions) but they create a very detailed exploration into the controversial aspects of his character and nature as worldwide symbol. He both symbolizes the idealism and need for armed resistance to oppression and revolutionary failings in the post-World War II third world countries and their hindering by such activities as um the CIAs meddling.<br /><br />But yet again all of that is projected on-screen in this case not through long scenes of dialog and speeches but through a much more intimate suffering portrayal of Che at the end of his thread and his life. Again the rules have changed and in this case its hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all. The number of times the camera shows people literally trapped between a rock and a hard place and the desaturated shaky long takes involves the audience into the narrative of people imprisoned in a hostile landscape an existential hell where revolutionary beliefs ultimately end up taking second tier to the desperation of hunted people starving to death. Its just not that easy of a movie to watch but its very effective.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB',pos
'Miles OKeeffe once again assumes the role of the mighty Ator in this the first sequel to the original film.<br /><br />What can I say? - This pretty much represents B-Movie Nirvana! <br /><br />The plot is ludicrous the script is terrible the acting is hammy throughout the special effects....well lets not even go there! - all in all this movie is a veritable delight! <br /><br />Highlights of the film include Ator and Thong (his mute companion not his undergarments) being attacked by invisible assailants in a cave (certainly saved on the fx budget there!) Ator battling what has to be the most unconvincing giant snake ever committed to celluloid and of course the infamous hangliding scene! <br /><br />Theres one question I have though......at the end of the movie we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator supposedly destroys the Geometric Nucleus (as the narrator tells us)......how in the hell did Ator destroy it and manage get out alive?! Did he fashion some form of primitive timer/detonator or something? <br /><br />Oh well such an illogical ending really only adds to the movies overall charm - they just dont make them like this anymore!',pos
'Awful is really all one needs to know. First think of all the things that could be bad about a movie. And then try to make a movie that is bad in all of these ways. You will have made Vacationland. The state of Maine should feel insulted: its much too nice a place to serve as the backdrop for such trite mindless boring schlock. Im a romantic and I always want movies about two people finding each other to succeed and I tried hard to find the good in this one. It was tough; very tough. I couldnt find a glimmer of emotional connection among any of the characters in this exercise in humdrum dreariness. Except maybe in one or two of the bad guys.<br /><br />Maine IS a good vacationland; this movie is not.',neg
'The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - Is the piston firing short? (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very lovable and very intelligent too. Her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours. The hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well. Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? The puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well. Its awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival. It loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the US Govt. I dont see why it doesnt figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. Great Movie it has the presidential seal of approval on it!',pos
'I LOVE Don Knotts let me just say that up-front! He is an enormous talent and the best at what he does which is portray a nervous lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority. He is fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming the Reluctant Astronaut but the film is pretty dull really even though as a kid my brother and I delighted in watching this and his other films. Its still worth watching but really its a film that is best enjoyed by children. Id categorize it as 100\% family-friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night.<br /><br />As with all of Knotts films theres a great cast of beloved character actors and you cant help but smile when Knotts gives one of his shaky open-mouthed stares no matter how old and jaded you are.<br /><br />From an adult perspective one thing I think that is great about this film is how it captures NASA in the 1960s -- all the new modern buildings the hope the optimism the future! And I was surprised at how suave and studly Leslie Neilsen was back then. Only complaint about the story is Roys love interest a rather threadbare unlikeable woman who cant give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot -- if youre like me youll be hoping that he gives her the shove-off at the end. Beware -- youll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching its that catchy.',neg

It cuts out entire scenes and subplots (if you can them that) from the film. The CBC which presents most of films untouched took half the guts out of WHALE MUSIC. I dont know why.

'Hollywood North is a satirical look at the time in Canadian film history when the Canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in Canada. Most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to get American films made. For example Porkys came out of it. Anyways Matthew Modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved Canadian novel. However in order to get the money he needs a American name star. He gets a loose cannon and learns he has to compromise to the point where the film no longer resembles the book it was originally based on. It plays well in Canada but may not be understood outside of the Great White North. Americans will think were satirizing ourselves but will miss the point that were actually satirizing them. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.',pos

'This is a stereotype plot. A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight.<br /><br />The fights are not of high standards. They are way too simple in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. The coach yells do this and do that with no success. And after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. This results in a turning point in the fight although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point. Think about the Rocky movies and youll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes. The fights are also shot poorly.<br /><br />There final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance. Cheesy music and awkward moments are not what I call entertainment.<br /><br />These guys really could have made some quality entertainment but the director wasnt up to the task. Or the other crew in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget I dont know but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10.',neg

'First the current IMDb plot description seems to be misleading the movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic hitchhiker who plans to kill them all. They stop at a small motel where he holds them hostage but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. Violence ensues.<br /><br />I picked this up by mistake thinking it was the other 2007 movie The Hitcher. Not that The Hitcher is any better and I was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway but this was almost unbearable at times. I think I could have vomited on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this.<br /><br />I cant even count how many movies Ive seen with virtually the same storyline so this was almost painfully predictable at times but what really made it awful were a few scenes that ... well let me give an example. At one point a door is covered in (what is very obviously) blood and two police officers at the scene because of a 911 call are looking at it from 30 feet away see a man also covered in blood walk out of the door agree that it looks suspicious but decide to not investigate further.<br /><br />But however ridiculous it may be the movie was never boring was well produced directed and acted complete with good special effects gratuitous nudity and violence. I probably would not recommend actually spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie but it turned out to be perfect to have on while I cleaned my basement. Also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan on doing more talking than watching.',neg
'This movie was so bad I dont know where to begin apparently neither did the filmmakers. It starts off with a guy in his mid thirties to late forties watching TV. The news tells of a corn maze thats open for Halloween. He has a vision of God knows what and rushes off the save his kids who are walking into a cornfield maze and are somehow linked to this vision How you ask? I dont know and as I said before neither do the filmmakers. Theyre simply visions of peoples feet. How did he get these visions? Its never explained were just supposed to go along with it. He enters the maze to find his two daughters who are lost inside and twice the girls hes looking for walk right past him one time they actually run into him. What does he do? Does he chase after them? No. He stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just ran past. Do the girls stop? No. They run off then ask Was that Dad? Then someone dressed as demon jumps on the star (the Dad character) he beats him up in a pathetic fight only to find out hes a worker at the haunted maze. The police are called and after finding the star (which is a really bad term to use) they cuff him. They cuff his hands in front of him so that he can find something to pick the lock with which he does. First off anybody whos ever been arrested knows that cops cuff your hands behind your back and secondly why does this average guy seem to know how to pick the lock on handcuffs? Well he eventually gets away from the cops who give up and leave after a the stars wife sets off the siren in the police car as a distraction. By the way its now night time and all the workers running the maze have seem to have left once the sun went down. Leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze. Considering it was a slow night that these are their only customers why not. Besides the cops apparently have better things to do as well. By the way the star who goes by the name of Walker we figure out its his last name a name in which his wife even calls him by. Somehow he knows there is something buried in the middle of this cornfield maze and starts digging. I say somehow because I couldnt figure out why he started digging in the first place. He finds a locket what does it mean? Nothing to anyone who watches this but to him its some sort of clue to a crime. Somebody killed their kids in his vision and I guess thats what hes going on real detective work. And by now he knows theres a killer loose in the corn maze one he somehow knew was there from the start of the film which is why hes looking for his girls. Every time we see the killer or rather the killers feet we hear a weird robotic sound like a sci-fi reject toy that changes a persons voice to sound mechanical. Why do we hear this sound? Is it in anyway related to...anything? Again who knows? Certainly not the filmmakers. The peak of all the bad acting and bad dialog was when Walker yells out Hey you Mr. Bad Man...Im gonna get you. Another time his wife is attacked by the Bad Man at the entrance to the corn maze which like I mentioned before is oddly empty of any employees or policemen. The Bad Man calls Walker on his cell phone to tell him that he plans on killing his wife and kids and him as well. Walker can only reply with Hey. HEY! before dropping his phone and running off. With no one on the other end to talk to the killer drops his phone too he drags the wife a few feet then leaves her alone for the rest of the film losing the first opportunity to hold true to his treats. If this script wasnt written by a child Id be surprised. Opps it wasnt. It was written directed and produced by the same guy. And not only that he also did so much of the crappy camera work as well where we get random shots of feet walking through the muddy maze and meaningless shots of the cornfield that waste 90\% of the film time. In the end Walker uses the cuffs to cuff the Bad Man who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that Walker had picked it with. Apparently there are lots of small metal objects just laying around this cornfield. But after the killer insists hes still going to kill the kids Walker kills the Bad Man and everything is right with the world again. Now in reality this makes Walker a murderer hes killed a man who Supposedly murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his. He knows this not because of proof but because of his visions. He never found a body nobody else knows this guy was even in the maze. And the locket? He gives it back to the ghosts of the two dead girls. No proof. So he kills a man without any tangible reason. I cant imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. It must have been a way to cover up a misappropriation of funds for the production company. I would rather watch the Blair Witch Project five times than see this film again. The actors should be ashamed. The director/producer/writer/cameraman should also be ashamed. In fact the entire production company should be ashamed. If there is anyone associated with this film please reply. What were you thinking?',neg
'I really didnt expect much from this movie but it wasnt bad; actually it was quite good. This movie contained a couple of the funniest bits of writing I have ever seen from a motion picture. Now am not saying this is one of the funniest movies of all time but I laughed pretty hard at some parts. The police ruled my fathers death a suicide. They said he fell down an elevator shaft. Onto some bullets. Now this movie is not for everybody its mostly stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hated these movies I would probably recommend you to steer clear. Overall it was an enjoyable movie about a group of superhero wannabes who end up becoming real heroes in the end. Its a vastly overrated comedy that many people probably havent seen yet because like me before viewing it expected it to be utter garbage. After viewing this film I finally understand why this movie was able to assemble such a superstar cast which includes Ben Stiller William H. Macy Hank Azaria and even that kid from Good Burger. Its because Mystery Man is full of excellent comedic writing period 7 out of 10. A very big surprise.',pos
' I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place in an impalpable grayness with nothing underfoot with nothing around without spectators without clamor without glory without the great desire of victory without the great fear of defeat in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism without much belief in your own right and still less in that of your adversary. If such is the form of ultimate wisdom then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be. Marlow in Joseph Conrads Heart of Darkness<br /><br />Its difficult to make lyrical the subject of death in any work of art. Yet movies have recently made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is embraced as a part of the cycle of all living things and it can be chosen rather than legislated. Chosen is the operative word for Alejandro Amenabars Sea Inside based loosely on the true story of the Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice clothed in love poetry and friendship. If it sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003) in which a cancerous professor says farewell to lifelong friends and loves before he takes his life then you are right. In fact Sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the protagonist before he goes a remarkable feat with not one of those moments in the least dull or uninteresting.<br /><br />Javier Bardem as Ramon has expressive eyes and commanding voice for the romantic quadriplegic a combination of tough realist and poetic sufferer. Belen Rueda plays the disabled lawyer Julia who becomes an imaginary lover for Ramon increasing in radiance as her life degenerates with disease. Added to the already almost soap opera circumstance is Lola Duenas as Rosa a blue collar visitor who initially tries to dissuade Ramon from seeking death but quickly falls in love with him. Talk about romanticizing disabilityThis guy has unbelievable luck attracting substantial women and he cant move a finger. But talk he can proving the ultimate argument about what women want: love that speaks not just makes.<br /><br />I will refrain from mentioning the major motion picture now up for an Oscar that features euthanasia as its climax in order not to spoil the experience for first timers. Sufficient it is just to say both films are successful in opening up both sides of a contentious subject without forcing a specific point of view. The religious right has a right to complain that the former film and Barbarian Invasions celebrate suicide; it has no right to accuse the beautifully balanced Sea Inside of the same.<br /><br />A life in this condition has no dignity Ramon says. The irony is he conducts himself with supreme dignity that makes anyone question his determination to end his life. The Sea Inside is a formidable entry in 2004s Oscar nominations for best foreign language film.',pos
'How much longer are we to persist with this flawed belief that once a director produces great ground-breaking work all future work cant be all that bad after all he made such-and-such.<br /><br />Mulholland Drive is a case in point and is in fact unmitigated rubbish. The performances are excellent particularly from Watts and Theroux but a good film they do not necessarily make. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making a film unnecessarily wierd only works when it takes the audience by surprise. When the audience is expecting the film to not make sense then the film has to have some substance to keep the audience interested. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the film with the murder-mystery set up with lots of twists and red herrings and then ... plop! The story decends into a quagmire of bizarre halucinations and pointless segues. Methinks Lynch realised how muddled the film was becoming and threw in the lesbian and mastobatory scenes to the audience awake and to stop the male viewers from standing up and leaving.<br /><br />Watching the film at the preview I was surrounded by Lynchophiles who had no more idea of what was going on than I did but left the theatre commenting on the layers and layers of Lynchs film-making. Excuse me but these people are the same nitwits who stand in art galleries staring at canvasses that have been painted white commenting on the courage of the artist at painting such a brave work.<br /><br />Films like these are made because (a) Lynch is trading on his previous work; and (b) because people convince themselves that unintelligeable film is art and therefore must be good. I queried a number of the Lynchophiles about what they ACTUALLY liked in the film and only response I recieved that wasnt a broad layers type of answer was that they liked it when the chicks got their kit off.<br /><br />Nuff said.',neg
'The film My Name is Modesty is based around an episode that takes up about one page in the 10th modesty Blaise novel called Night of the Morningstar. It describes an incident in which the young Modesty (17 in the book mid twenties in the film)asserts her leadership in a war over a casino. As this is set before the actual Blaise adventures her trusted sidekick Willi Garvin is not in the film. That is one of the main problems as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip. The other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay. The casting is okay but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young Modesty. I get the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution as not to lose the rights to the Blaise franchise.',neg

Its cool to see Stephen Kings cameo as the minister of the funeral.<br /><br />Of course there are some script errors: How can a rich doctor with two small kids goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house? How Gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck? Why Louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters? Things like that doesnt make any sense but I can understand that all horrors scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work.<br /><br />A good thing I saw in this movie is the necessity to talk about death with the children no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist and also that avoiding important subjects doesnt help anything. Because of Louis being afraid to be honest with Ellie confronting her and saying that her cat wouldnt be back again all the nightmare began.',pos
'Simply put the only saving grace this movie has is settings costumes and an OK punk concert. How H.R.Giger must feel about his cyborg picture on the cover of this movie I wouldnt like to know. Right away all I could do was make sardonic comments about the films protagonists I was hoping that the freaks in this movie would execute them in gory fashion. I sense SPOILERS a comin! I was wondering if this film in the spirit of the first 20 min. was intended to be as humorously half-baked as the rest of it? Examining all the obvious political outcries (Police trying to rape a freak the discussion of superficialities between the freak and the frat boy and the punk concert w/ the female vocalist) and the use of slow-motion in the fighting sequences (which screams martial-arts coordinator) I just dont know. The character named Steve irked me since he tries to pick fights w/ people off the street (he shoulda been mugged and raped) and looks bad when he broke that guys neck towards the end (want me to show you how to do it?) I must say this though if they wouldve developed other characters better than they did Splatter this might have gone somewhere. If there was a 0 to give this movie it wouldve got it but alas its a 1.',neg
'My guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts and thus at least a quarter longer because otherwise how can one explain its confused abbreviated storyline. I was never completely lost but I was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. The movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.<br /><br />If it were longer it might make more sense but it still wouldnt be much good. The movies most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female but the movie drops the ball on this making Heras followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you dont see the gods and theres no real certainty that they exist. So its got a couple of intriguing ideas but it doesnt do anything useful with them.<br /><br />Bad dialog cardboard characters and one interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic sons. Not unwatchable but also not worth watching.',neg
'I watched this series after Tipping the Velvet for which I gave 10/10 grade. I had read user comments on this and I expected an equally good series or if possible even better. At this point I must emphasize that this series is good and it definitely captured me throughout it and thus worth watching. However I didnt enjoy it as much as Tipping the Velvet for the following reasons: <br /><br />1. Less passion love and related sexual content. There were surprisingly little emphasis in these elements which I held integral for a love story. Fingersmith felt like a watered down version of Tipping the Velvet.<br /><br />2. Similarly as in Tipping the Velvet the story had three parts: the beginning a shocking second part and the ending. The second part should have been the climax of the story (as in Tipping the Velvet) but instead it was almost totally skipped perhaps due to inability to make shocking but believable asylum content. The series should have been in three parts featuring two cliffhangers with a lot more focus on the second part.<br /><br />3. Almost no weight was given to what Fingersmiths were and how it affected their personalities. I found it rather annoying that the series did not properly address such central topic. <br /><br />4. The ending was much more hasty than in Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith left several interesting plot lines open.<br /><br />Despite these shortcomings Fingersmith is a good series and well worth 7/10. However it is not a classic like Tipping the Velvet.',pos
'Like the 5-year old protagonists of his latest opus Hayao Miyazakis Ponyo enchants with its unbridled innocence as though the anime-meister has become a child himself in weaving a narrative that relishes in its simplicity and emits an infectious charm in the process. Miyazaki recalling his earlier works paints a brightly-colored world obviously geared for the younger audiences and the raw effervescence gleefully strips off the grim thematic elements that distinguish its immediate predecessors.<br /><br />Ponyo (voiced lovably by Yuria Nara) a fish with a young girls face (making her look like a cuddly child in a pink overgrown Halloween costume) escapes away from her underwater home and her school of siblings to explore the surface. Stranded ashore she is rescued by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi) a five-year old boy who along with his mom Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) resides in a house on the nearby cliff. This initial encounter and eventually friendship has a profound effect on Ponyo who now wishes to become human but by becoming so inadvertently tips natures balance and unleashes a maelstrom on land. With Sosukes help Ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a human.<br /><br />Despite the plot lacking the philosophical sophistication of say his most recent Spirited Away Ponyo is nothing short of an astounding follow-up characterized by the extremely diligent attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and the fantastic and of the simple joys and great fears. Its a straightforward tale that though at times stalled by its tendency to ramble like a toddler keeps in tune with its youthful pedigree to magically enthrall. I will protect you Sosuke tells Ponyo matter-of-factly a childlike assertion not unlike the manner in which Miyazaki endows his story with artful spirit.',pos
'The alternate title of Ecstasy is Symphony of Love; a title which appropriately describes the mood and feel of the film. Ecstasy is an early talkie and could have very well been a classic film if released during the silent film era. This film is a visual treat and is deliberately paced so the viewer can savour its sensuous lyric quality which is presented in an artistic low-key fashion. The directors style is distinctly European. The subject matter and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated than what was being produced in Hollywood at that time. Consider the censorship code in the US during the 30s that pretty much sums it up. Hedy Lamarr one of the great beauties of all time was a perfect choice for this Symphony of Love.',pos
'I wish it were Last Dumb Thriller. But thrillers are like that. They are like children: numerous illogical and often annoying. They want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a childs behaviour or a thrillers plot? Having seen this particular child - I mean... thriller - I understand why reviewers refer to it as a hitchcockian thriller; they might as well have called it idiotic for thats what hitchcockian means in the movie dictionary (look it up if you dont believe me). Even the soundtrack is old-school Hollywood which is a mistake: it doesnt fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony. Besides how dare they steal De Palmas idea of stealing from Hitchcock?! The story is absurd. Scheiders wife is killed and her killers are never an issue. Instead first his former employers follow him around and later decide to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? No explanation. Perhaps because the FBI is a dark dark organization (X-Files) which is very trigger-happy about knocking off its former employees for pension-funds reasons. Or perhaps because its fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie; everyone seems to be after him. And while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy in reality the killer is... Janet Margolin! Yes the woman occupying Scheiders living quarters; the one that briefly hinted she was depraved. Why does she go after Scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid - and followed by his own ex-employers - and not a few years earlier or few years after the wifes murder? A pure hitchcockian (look it up again in the dictionary in case you forgot what it means) coincidence. And how about that brilliant motive of hers...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a fresh-off-the-boat 15 year-old virgin in NY and then syphilisized by a bunch of horny Jewish men one of whom - tah-dah! - is Scheiders grandfather. As a result Margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time (among other things) in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilisized her once-virginal grandmother. How hitchcockian (look it up) is that? The finale then shamelessly rips off the Mount Rushmore scene from North By Northwest except that the love-interest is a killer and she doesnt get saved.<br /><br />The movie also offers some dubious/off-kilter dialog and some not-so great acting. Check out the silly and obvious way in which Napier follows Scheider at the cemetery. Lets also not forget the moronic plot-device of Napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously - but it wasnt a gun! How brilliant! Napier in the tower: now theres another string of illogical behavioural patterns. J. Demme was is and always will be a director without style without flair and the man who directed Philadelphia. Lets give him another Oscar!',neg
'I think Dark Angel is great! First season was excellent and had a good plot. With Max(Jessica Alba) as an escaped X-5 manticore creation trying to adapt to a normal life but still saving the world. And being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice.<br /><br />The second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first. The plot kinda disappeared and the series lost a little of its charm mostly because of all the weird creatures appearing. Dont get me wrong the second season is good but with a little bit to much of the manticores. However they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2 in which I had a lot of hopes to see more of.<br /><br />So I really wish they could start making new episodes. And with James Cameron behind this it cant go wrong. So as a conclusion I would say its a great series however Im still hoping for a third season!',pos
'is it just me or have all horror movies become nothing more than titties slapstick and an over the top villain who cannot be killed. this movie had no point. whatever happened to the days of a person being able to escape from the killer as in hostel. and at least make the killer a little more realistic. victor crowley was the worst killer i have ever seen. he reminded me of a demon spawn between quasimodo and leatherface. it was over the top that while victor was lying there on fire no one thought to finish the job. and the ending was the biggest disappointment of all reminiscent of the sopranos finale. i had to agree with the fella behind me when he blurted... WHAT THE F***! if i could give the movie a negative score i would have taken care of it.',neg
'The Ladies Man suffers a common problem among movies based on Saturday Night Live skits. And that is a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes.

So this movie is funny enough but its no Waynes World!',pos
'<br /><br />In 1970 after a five year absence Kurosawa made what would be his first film in color. Dodes Ka-Den is a film that centers around many intertwining stories that go on in a small Tokyo slum.<br /><br />The title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes as he imagines he is operating a train. We slowly get to know more of the people in the small community the two drunks who trade wives because they are not happy with the ones they have. The old man who is the center of the town who helps out a burglar that tries to rob him. The very poor father and son that cannot ever afford a house so they imagine one up of their own. By the end of the film the stories all come full circle some turn out happy others sad.<br /><br />Since this was Kurosawas first color film you can see that he uses it to his advantage and it shows. Maybe too much. This movie goes in many different directions and its hard to settle down and get into it. But dont get me wrong Dodes Ka-Den may not be Kurosawas best but coming from the greatest director of all time its much better than 99\% of todays films.',pos
'This was the worst movie my wife and I have ever seen. The only concessions is that we did not pay to see it at the movies as we rented this on DVD from the video store. Simply - No plot worth mentioning (I only watched it 5 minutes ago and already I have forgotten) annoying characters played poorly by two-bit actors and if this was suppose a comedy I am still waiting to laugh. In fact the only laugh we got out of the movie was that we joked with each other that we agreed it was truly awful.<br /><br />Put simply this movie was quite utterly pathetic and I warn others to not waste their time. A travesty of the National Lampoon name  Rating 0/10.',neg
'This film is just a shame. Orlando Florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area (like Vancouvers rise to prominance). The Brothers was shot in Central Florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area (which made great strides with the Indie film Walking Across Africa and the great HBO miniseries From Earth To The Moon).<br /><br />I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to film The Brothers. It had the potential to give a new spin on the Boy Band craze. After all both NSync and the Backstreet Boys come from this area. But The Brothers falls short probably because of a weak script. Both lead characters are flat with almost no development (part of this could be the amatuer actors but some of it is certainly the way the script was written).<br /><br />Also a problem is the choice of jokes. Many of the jokes are too repetitive (they do come off funny the first time but it does grow to be a bit boring). Some of the concert scenes are staged poorly (and many of these scenes also dont seem to move the story along in any way).<br /><br />I had high hopes for this one but alas its a disappointing effort. I also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short. But I think the best thing for filmmaker John Figg is to move to different genres (quickly). Comedy isnt his strong suit. But its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the Orlando area (its just a shame that right now hes infamous not famous).<br /><br />',neg
'This film has an amazing cast. MGM took some of its finest character actors and starred them in a film with the usually adorable Margaret OBrien. Lionel Barrymore Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same home. While they have amassed a fortune over the years they also have been selfish jerks. One of them has an idea to donate some property in order to buy themselves a good name (sort of like Carnegie) but it turns out the property they want to give away actually belongs to OBrien. And since shes an orphan they volunteer to be her guardians so they can give HER property away and look like great philanthropists.<br /><br />There also is a goofy subplot involving fairies--led by the wonderful character actor Henry Davenport. And since OBrien is Irish (as evidenced by her outrageous accent) she and the little people make up much of the plot. Frankly I absolutely hated this portion of the film and wished theyd just dropped it entirely. Instead the story could STILL have been about sweet Margaret melting the mean old mens hearts--this would have worked. But...the little people?!? Sheesh! Overall the actors try very very hard but the silliness of the plot and the deadly earnest way they tried made me cringe. I noticed a lot of people liked this film--I guess Im just an old grouch! I found the film horrible difficult to watch.',neg
'I found this to be an entertaining account of the challenges an independent film maker might encounter (something I never even thought about). The film managed to keep my interest the entire time and I actually laughed out loud more than once! Im not a film maker so I know nothing about the technology but I though it was well edited and flowed smoothly telling the story. As a disclaimer I contributed to this effort after the fact providing music for the soundtrack but I was not involved in the creation of this film and I could not tell you a thing about Repo Man except that I remembered seeing it way back when (Im not really a sci-fi fiend). I enjoyed the comparisons the film made of punk rock file making to punk rock music.

'A definite no. A resounding NO. This movie is an absolute dud.<br /><br />Having been recommended to me by a friend very much into that sort of thing I watched this movie with some anticipation of being informed changed moved altered uplifted and all the other positive mystical things that could happen to me when I suddenly see The Truth. Now this may sound like someone who is already predisposed to poo-pooing anything dealing with the metaphysical the metaphysical/physical boundaries of existence. Believe me I am not such a person. I try to be open about any presentation and then decide accordingly.<br /><br />In terms of content the only thing I found mildly interesting and informative was the bit about peptides emotions addiction and cellular receptors. That was the only unifying element I could find in the documentary part of this film. The rest of the documentary rambled around several topics and never seemed to unify and cohere try to tie up and conclude to a point. And what was all that stuff about native Americans not being able to see the ships that Columbus came in? Who told the authorities in this film that that was what happened in 1492? Where they there too? Had they compared this to scientific work being done in visual cognition (the famous gorilla video for example visit the Visual Cognition Lab at the University of Illinois site) there may have been a more convincing point made. Here however it seemed like unsupported mystical mumbo-jumbo.<br /><br />As a film: this wasnt one film it was two. I found the documentary part mildly interesting just to hear the people talking about what they were talking about (I was annoyed that their credentials werent presented at the bottom of the screen when they spoke at least initially!) But I found the story part of the movie with Matlin in it annoying disjointed intrusive non-related and downright stupid. That bit about the Polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny. It was laughable ludicrous sophomoric and stupid. And I found the use of the word Pollack offensive. It just seemed so out of place and wrong. Is such usage okay because a member of the group uses a pejorative term to refer to the group because he or she is a member of the group? That may be okay to make a point but it didnt seem to be used that way here. And in any case I dont care what the reason it offended me a Pole. I never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as Pollack. And I certainly dont like like it when others do. Can I watch or listen to a bigoted conversation in which this term is used? You betcha! But again this didnt seem to be the case here. It just seemed so out of place. Unprovocked unmitigated.<br /><br />The acting was abysmal. Elaine Hendrixs performance was totally unbelievable. At times it seemed like she was just reading her lines that had just been given to her. Marlee Matlin for the most part seemed to be sleep walking through this whole thing. Perhaps she was baffled by the material. I know I was. If she was supposed to be portraying a disillusioned drugged-up anxiety-prone malcontent it just didnt seem to click. But by far the worlds worst was Hendrix! All in all I found this a disjointed poorly acted piece of clap-trap.',neg
'It begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectations.<br /><br />Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sams (John Abraham) characters are not properly built before Macs boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess. Rest of the drama is about how Mac Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations which at times seem forced.<br /><br />About the cast Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor I thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook. Akshay Kumar is tolerable John Abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture & Rajpal Yadav is the only saving grace in the movie. <br /><br />The second half of the movie is funny at times but in all a DUD (songs are boring) and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy.',neg
'I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see it was cheaply made. Badly scripted and with very bad acting. I have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book. We couldnt take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained. The experience of watching this was like The Blair Witch visits Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it. The witch throws the contents of it on the boy and the whole family laughs. I thought it was nasty and very strange. I really cant understand why someone would think that would be entertaining. It shows another scene where Dr. Mize arrives and Betsy Bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers. Instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother. How sick? The little boy in the first scene of the many scenes dealing with how your body disposes of wastes begs for toilet paper and goes to the out house and makes these sickening faces of joy with sound effects. I think they should have left all of that out. The makeup on the Reverend James Johnston as a older man didnt really make you assume he was older. It made you think he was dipped in fish batter. The blood on Joshua Gardner when he falls from the ladder is even worse. The John Bell death scene looks like they got out flour and tried to do something with it to make him look as a serious sick man. To me to much sickening comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this picture. These people would do better if they film commercials for local TV Stations for bathroom products. They chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner. I rate this film Capital F minus.',neg
'There is no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii. But sadly even though he directed quite a few films that gained huge international attention there are still a fair few of his films that have slipped through the cracks. Tachiguishi is one of them and even though I loved it to bits its not hard to see why distributors in the West are somewhat reluctant to release it.<br /><br />In between his big and serious films Oshii is known to do some smaller and quirkier projects. While Tachiguishi definitely falls into this category Oshii has really outdone himself with this one creating something that is very hard to classify even as a freaky Japanese flick. Go figure.<br /><br />At its very core lies a documentary not quite unlike Otaku no Video. But rather than make a fool of an existing subculture Oshii invents his own and delves into the lives of culinary heroes scrounging away food for free and upholding the Japanese culinary level. Oshiis approach on the subject has close ties with Dai-Nipponjin as the subject is handled with a deadly sense of gravity while the images on screen look as ridiculous as can be. Deadpan humor taken to the extreme.<br /><br />But that is not all rather than simply shooting his mockumentary Oshii decided to make it using a new visual technique baptized superlivemation. A weird mix of live action photography digital animation and puppets on a stick. Performed and acted out (or posed if you want) by the greats of the Japanese animation industry no less as the project was supposed to be as low-budget as possible.<br /><br />And if you think that just about covers it know that the film is extremely dialogue-heavy making it a good companion piece for Innocence. The influence of the grifters is analyzed from all kinds of cultural political and even philosophical angles fired at the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues. And to make it even worse the whole film is completely grounded in actual Japanese history and customs making it even harder for a foreigner to get a good grip on the material. Needless to say multiple viewings are advised to make the best of all the details tucked away inside the film.<br /><br />That said on a conceptual level the film is easy to follow and already pretty hilarious. Various grifters are introduced as were they the most influential historical figures of post-war Japan. The film plays like youd expect a serious documentary of any other important figure to unfold but somehow the big and crudely animated cut-out photography limbs of which figures are assembled dont quite make it all that serious. The range of characters introduced is sublime Shinji Higuchi taking the cake as cow-creature wearing a nose ring while taking on the fast-food chains with his gang of bull/people.<br /><br />Oshii regular Kenji Kawai provides besides a pretty comical performance a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky strange and comical. A lot of fun is to be had from the exaggerated noises and effects complementing the animation and totally contradicting the tone of the rest of the film.<br /><br />Visually the film is very atmospheric though it must be said that the animation is pretty scarce and while effective remains toned down only to burst out in hyperactive weirdness from time to time. Which is not exactly a bad thing seeing how Tachiguishi is so dialogue-heavy. Despite that the film is still a visual masterpiece as each frame looks absolutely lush and is tailored to match and improve the general atmosphere of the film.<br /><br />Beware though because Tachiguishi does demand a lot from the viewer. If you dont speak Japanese there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that demand some attention. On top of that the monologues in the film area quite extended and can be hard to follow. The film still lacks English subtitles and even though my French was largely sufficient to get what it was all about Im sure I missed many of the finer points of the film.<br /><br />Tachiguishi is not an easy film to get into but around halfway through it reaches full steam and it doesnt let off from there on. I still hope to see this one again with English or Dutch subs. A dub would actually be best for a film like this (much like Container) though I guess a quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask for.<br /><br />With all of that said I can only congratulate Oshii on another marvelous film. Its rare to find a film that blends and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works. The film is smart looks and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity. It is immensely funny even if you cant catch all the details on the first viewing. But be sure to at least get this with decent subs as the automated English translation that is floating out there is completely worthless and does the film no justice at all.<br /><br />Tachiguishi caters to a very specific audience and Im not surprised the French got their release while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the Western world) is still waiting for a sign of this film. But for those that like Oshii appreciate dry and deadpan humor and crave creative spirits it is a film that cannot be missed even though it could just as well misfire. 4.5*/5.0*',pos
'The 80s were overrun by all those HALLOWEEN/Friday THE 13TH slasher-style horror movies so this is something of a relief.<br /><br />Ten unbelievably annoying teenagers (would you want to hang out with these jerks?!) decide to throw a Halloween party at a local former funeral parlor called Hull House.

'Very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue bad flashbacks and an almost entirely male cast. The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men.<br /><br />OToole is riveting whenever he speaks; unfortunately he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he too is terribly underused.<br /><br />The film has one additional positive aspect in that it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of the Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. Too many of todays films about WWII paint the Allies as all-good and the Axis as all-evil when history tells us people are far more complicated than that!<br /><br />This would be a good movie for when youre recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex.

'The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine I got to hear about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson through my agent whether he might like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it. I was told too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. Its a beautifully made piece from a hurriedly written first draft I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldnt be so good. I would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? I would also love to see the film again I only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in Soho.',pos

'Exactly what you would expect from a B-Movie. Deritive gratuitous nudity boring in parts ridiculous gore and cheesy special-effects. Of course it could have been better better acted (defintly) better written directed etc. But then I guess it wouldnt have been a B movie. The actors pretty much sucked in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood profanity and nudity.<br /><br />Tiffany Shepis must be singled out. She absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium. Not that acting really matters in these movies but she was better than any of the other actors. Shes also smokin hot in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie - wow! Her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit I mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out. And near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekked.<br /><br />So if your a looser b-movie horror buff (like myself) check this out.

'Ah the spirit of 68. The streets of Paris were running wild with rebellion the hippies were high on the spirit of love. How was Britain marking this age of radicalism and revolution? Erm by the looks of it dear Old Blighty was focusing on making films about boys in boarding schools. If... contains the evil establishment. It contains the uprising of the oppressed. What it lacks in contrast to the Parisien passion and the hippy headtripping is any sense of excitement except in its all-out ammo-and-artillery fire ending.<br /><br />Lindsay Andersons If... stars the ever-marvellous Malcolm McDowell as one of three private school pupils who decorate their dorm with photos of Lenin and other left-wing radicals. Its clearly an anti-establishment movie in its depiction of the evil upper-class oiks who rule the roost and the antiquated autocratic practices of the pish-posh public school standard. What makes If... unusual though is that for all its radical sympathies it doesnt explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system instead it just kind of floats: lacking in plot and lacking in personality.<br /><br />Surrealist bits fade in and out occasionally and the film slips from black-and-white to colour again (is it due to the low budget or is it an arty expression?) but there is little of interest to speak of. All we get is the poignant denouement where the young rebels reach for their rifles and shoot down the shady overlords of the establishment. Hooray! A revolution! At last something that demands a second thought unlike the rest of this dull exercise in boarding school daydreaming.<br /><br />If... could have been a powerful political statement but as it is it drifts and only gathers any sense of direct interest at the end. Instead of being a testament to the dissident zeitgeist of the late-Sixties it only succeeds in being a dazed document of upper-class British education. Anarchy? Apathy more like the only man many viewers will want to stick it to after watching If... will be Lindsay Anderson.',neg
'Most of this film was okay for a sequel of a sequel of a sequel...<br /><br />I was impressed by the amount of suspense there was; I HAD actually expecting that to be chucked out the window in favor of gore gore gore. It wasnt but theres some pretty ridiculous deaths.<br /><br />The thing that I disliked however was all of the plot complications. Those could have been okay if the scriptwriters had taken the time to explain all of them through. But what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution specifically? Why were they protected from Michaels damage until a certain point? What exactly were they going to do with the baby? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant for that matter? Why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant too? Why did Michael kill all his co-conspirators in the end? Why were there fetuses in the lab? The actors seemed to have figured it all out once they saw the fetuses.. But it was never explained to the audience.<br /><br />If youre just going to watch this film to see people get snuffed then thisll be okay for you.. However if you cant stand a plot being thrown at you which remains unresolved by the time the credits roll you should go watch something else.',neg
'I like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film. Terrance Stamp Guy Pearce & Hugo Weaving have all proved themselves as some of the best & most capable actors around but I could not get into this. I dont know if its because I dont understand the lifestyle or what but I could not get my head around this film. Worse than anything is that the actors made some of the ugliest drag queens Ive ever seen. I think that was part of the point I dont know. I realize that is probably an insult but I dont know what else to call them. I must say I bought the guys as the performers (the correct term?) but the story just wasnt very good or very interesting either. I will say that I cant usually appreciate costume designers very well although I notice them when they are wrong or out of place but I was very much impressed with these. Very creative to say the least just not attractive but I dont think theyre supposed to be. I dont know I am definitely not the target audience and would never go see a performance done by these kind of performers but I wouldnt go see ballet or opera either so I dont know. If this is your kind of film then you will probably like it but if its not skip it because it is...well not for most of us. I just checked it won the Oscar for costume design & I will say rightfully so. I must say Ebert didnt care much for this film either though he liked it better than I did.',neg
'Chuck Joness Rabbit Seasoning the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy is often considered to be the best of the three. While I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons I would have to concede that Rabbit Seasoning is the most finely honed script. Here the emphasis is placed on language as Bugs and Daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of Abbot and Costellos Whos on next routine. As a long term Daffy fan I have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy who gets all the best lines (the famous Pronoun trouble being one of the all time classics) and does most of the work. Bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while Elmer as always is the befuddled dupe. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose so little threat to Bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs. Elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old Daffy who comes off worst being shot in the face again and again his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions. It all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration Youre despicable. As intricate an example of Chuck Joness impeccable timing as youll come across Rabbit Seasoning is a true classic.',pos
'I love watching early colour films - you mean those 40s clothes werent all grey? <br /><br />Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie. Her eccentric garb is actually rather attractive and yes she has an amazing hourglass figure. But I feel she was given her head rather too much. She probably developed this characterisation over many performances and nobody told her If it gets a laugh leave it out. She does too much deranged fooling about when shes supposed to be surprisingly down to earth. The Madame Arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery. Arcati behaves like a retired headmistress (Well really put our backs into it!). The contrast between her breezy commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs isnt really brought out.<br /><br />Just because all the actors are English (apart from Cummings) the Americans feel they have to use the words Brit stiff lip and upper. Oh give it a rest! The three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqué remarks (Did he make love to you? Yes but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry!).',neg
'That movie while slightly flawed was entirely entertaining. About half an hour into Be Cool I started to have Hollywood Homicide flashbacks. But guess what? This is worse. Even the dance number is bad. I like most of the cast in this movie so that makes me feel bad about writing a negative review of it but I feel obligated. The Rock Andre 3000 and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy. No one else seemed to decide what movie genre they were acting in. I feel bad for Travolta because he brought the same Chili Palmer from Get Shorty to this movie. He was totally consistent in the role but this movie is so different from the original that the character sticks out like a sore thumb. I was going to give this movie 4/10 because I like the actors so much but there is a conversation in the movie about a certain song that is so asinine I couldnt believe the performers actually said it. If you want to go to the movies this weekend there should still be some Oscar contenders out there. That would be a much better way to spend your time.',neg
'My boyfriend and I decided to go see this movie after we heard on the radio that it was a good movie worth seeing even up there with Cars. Within the first ten minutes of the movie I was horrified. For starters the cows which should be females had male voices. Then I realized they really are supposed to be guys. I put the transvestite cows aside for a bit and tried to keep watching the movie with an open mind but it was just so corny I couldnt help but shake my head. I probably checked my phone about ten times to see if it was almost over. The plot was decent if not predictable but it took way to long to reach its point. I was having trouble sitting through it and Im 19. The children in the theater were actually getting up and running up and down the aisles. I felt like joining them. But my biggest problem with the movie was that it was loaded with drinking references not to mention that the cows/bulls actually hot wired and stole a car then drank and drive broke into a boys house to push him out of bed (he deserved it though) then ran away from the cops whom the writers of the movie made look like terrible people. This isnt the kind of thing I would want my kid to be exposed to. Theres way too much of that in the real world if I wanted my child to watch guys drink and drive and lead cops on a chase Id pop them in front of the 10 oclock news. Childrens movies are supposed to be an escape from reality not an escape into ridiculousness. What happened to the good morals and happy endings that childrens movies used to boast? Thats why Disneys old movies like Beauty and the Beast Lady and the Tramp The Little Mermaid etc. are classics. If you want your kids to see a great cartoon with basically the same plot as Barnyard rent The Lion King. You can get a great story without the awful drinking and driving and grand theft auto references. The writers of Barnyard were obviously trying to continue the great trend of making a childrens movie that a parent could enjoy as well but they did so in very bad taste. I would never take my kids to see this and I suggest you save your money and watch something else.',neg
'I think that this is a disappointing sequel. I miss a lot of the old characters (King Gator Anne Marie etc.) and I dont like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters. A lot of personality was lost in Charlie and the villain Red is not even half as bad as Carface was in the first one. If youre a big ADGTH fan like I am its worth seeing just to see how the story is continued but dont count on it being 5 stars in your book.',neg
'The final installment sees Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi (looking cooler than ever in his reversible overcoat!) pitched against each other for one last battle this time in the future. The plot owes a lot to Blade Runner but done in Takashi Miikes low budget frenetic comic style. I did feel that it was the weakest of the three DOA films and although the ending was still outrageous it lacked the shock value of the previous two. Compared to the likes of Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q DOA:Final is nowhere near as extreme but is faithful to the other two films in the trilogy. That said fans of the first two (and fans of Miike) will get a lot from this as it ties all three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists.',pos
'This is actually a trilogy of 3 of Somerset Maughams short tales. The first one is The Verger which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. After 17 years Albert Foreman is laid off from his church job because he cant read nor write. So what does he do? Opens a tobacco shop of course!<br /><br />The second is Mr. Know-All which was actually a story I had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten until I heard the familiar introduction. Another 15 minute one and also very good. It worked better on film than in a book for me but then perhaps thats because I was only 14 the last time afterall.<br /><br />The 3rd one is nearly a let-down. Almost an hour in length it simply drags. Its not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last 2. I watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really I hadnt missed a thing!<br /><br />Overall I give them 8 9 and 6 out of 10 respectively.',pos
'and quite frankly that just sums it up.<br /><br />It is a small computer animated series that is filmed just like an animal documentory....<br /><br />The animation is almost flawless (I thought the long necked swimming dinosaurs eyes looked fake).<br /><br />However some of the model shots didnt look quite that realistic...<br /><br />and I thought that Jurrassic park made a better T Rex..<br /><br />If this is the type of thing we see on a normal British TV series then I cannot wait to see what they can accomplish in the movies..<br /><br />I give this 10/10 stars...<br /><br />(and the making of video was also great.....the dinosaur on the skate board was halarious)<br /><br /><..>',pos
'The main cast:<br /><br />Vlastimil Brodský .... Frantisek Hána Stella Zázvorková .... Emílie Hánová Stanislav Zindulka .... Eda<br /><br />Director Vladimir Michalek gives this charming story of elderly folks enchanting twists that make the characters appealing really universal.<br /><br />Frantisek Hana is retired and on a pension his previous occupation unknown. He lives in a very nice apartment with his wife of forty-four years Emilie. His son Jara covets the spacious apartment as a problem-solver as he needs to house one of his ex-wives and several of their children. The son isnt a vicious schemer just a guy with one past spouse too many and a blind eye to the attachment his dad has for the flat (which he moved into after relinquishing a previous residence to the son).<br /><br />Hana and his also elderly close friend Ed spend there more than ample free time doing small con jobs not for money but for the pleasure of putting one over on easily duped folks like estate agents. A favorite ploy is for Hana to act the part of a retired divo of New Yorks Metropolitan Opera returning home in need of a sprawling mansion. Ed is his companion as gullible realtors fall all over themselves proffering chauffeured limousines and fine French restaurant meals in hope of a lucrative sale.<br /><br />When not engaged in well-planned scams the duo engage in quick ploys such as pretending to be railroad security agents so as to snatch kisses from breathless and ticketless teens trying to sneak onto trains. Chaste kisses that is: theres no lechery here.<br /><br />Hanas long-suffering wife is obsessed with saving enough money to insure that the couple individually and jointly have a grand funeral an event the life-loving Frantisek is in no hurry to experience.<br /><br />Disagreements about money and Frantiseks promiscuous disposition of marital funds lead to a crisis whose resolution rings both real and endearing. Michalek fishes for the viewers emotions but he does it openly honestly and effectively.<br /><br />Autumn Spring subtitled of course is a product of an increasingly vibrant Czech cinema. It wasnt shown widely in the U.S. but its availability on DVD will hopefully bring this affecting flick to a wide audience. Sadly Brodsky recently succumbed to cancer so this movie is a valedictory to a fine actor who imbued his character with a passion for lifes pleasures that must have reflected the actors own values.<br /><br />9/10.',pos
'This is not the worst movie Ive ever seen. I did not feel like I wanted to remove my eyeballs forcibly after watching Galaxina. It just is not good. The jokes are almost funny but fall short. All of them. The few gags that come close are beat back down by repeating them over and over. The production values are well non-existent. The sound is bad the lighting is bad ... it just seems cheaply made; overly so. The dialog ... well often it is missing - many awkward silences; they are all just standing around and it seems like someone should be saying something. The film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy - like maybe that developed after shooting started. It feels like someones film project that they threw together the night before it was due and if they had put two weeks into it it could have been good.<br /><br />And Im easy to please. I thought Mom and Dad Save the World was a hoot. I like Pluto Nash. Mystery Men is one of my favorite movies. Spaced Invaders is well nigh unto a classic. This turkey just doesnt do it. Space Truckers was more believable.<br /><br />Avery Schreiber who can be very funny tries too hard. His part calls for a straightman and he plays it leaning toward sitcom. Dorothy Stratten is OK in her role but not particularly noteworthy.<br /><br />Oh yeah the My watch is always slow. line was funny. Ill give this movie all the kudos it can get it needs it.<br /><br />The space vehicle models are not bad but they are few and are not used effectively. The space scenes are vague. No sweeping passes no close up detailed fly-bys not even appropriate action scenes when they dock. (The Infinity does crash land very oddly at one point.) The flight dynamics are terrible; worse than anything youve seen theyre jerky not smooth. The initial battle is stilted and static; even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion they trade (slow) shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a 16th century sea battle except not as exciting.<br /><br />The aliens - imagine if all of Star Wars was the cantina scene. That many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly no? A few are used as sight gags that work OK the first time but not the fifth.<br /><br />Mercifully if you attempt to watch Galaxina you are likely to fall asleep. (I got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes and did not feel like it was worth replaying it. If that doesnt say It sucked I dont know what does.) Sadly there is a lot of potential and this could easily have been a good movie. It would be easy to remake this and have a decent film.<br /><br />MadKaugh',neg
'I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. In both films the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.<br /><br />The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. Laura Dern puts in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle directing very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).<br /><br />',pos

Today he passed in cable TV and I remembered to access the site to do the comment.<br /><br />The End of the film surprised me a lot but it is what happens in the real life. Not always what thought about being the ideal it is what happens. <br /><br />The life brings us a lot of surprises.',pos
'As a massive fan of fantasy in general and of the works of Neil Gaiman *in particular* Ive been looking forward to this film so avidly so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can scarcely believe its finally here. And you know what? I neednt have feared the film version is bl**dy awesome. Different from the book but in a good way - less whimsical more comical still deeply sweet and enchanting.<br /><br />The special effects are absolutely spot-on and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of Wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive.<br /><br />Proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing and the casting in the main is a triumph with the ghostly Princes (whose roll-call read almost as a Whos Who of currently cool British comedy - Rupert Everett David Walliams of Little Britain fame two of the blokes from Green Wing etc) stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films funniest moments which exist in abundance. <br /><br />In fact the one minor criticism I have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little OTT subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story.... Ricky Gervais cameo for example was far too much just Ricky Gervais doing his usual David Brent from the Office comedy persona for my liking and in my opinion created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story (though in fairness from memory I believe the Ferdy character in the original book WAS pretty Ricky Gervais-esquire when I think back on it)....<br /><br />But this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance. Charlie Cox as the protagonist Tristan captures the correct mixture of naivety subtle comedy and self-realisation required for a story like this where a humble young boy embarks on life-changing quest; Claire Danes as Yvaine is beautiful feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal a perfect interpretation of her stellar role; Robert De Niro in the cameo every reviewer is talking about is indeed deserving of praise rollicking good fun (looks like hes having a ball too)... and Michelle Pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch Lamia my favourite performance of the film overall. If you enjoyed her deliciously b!tchy performance in the recent Hairspray then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this too.<br /><br />So to round off this review: you will laugh for sure you will smile and you may even cry - Stardust is a beautiful heart-warming fairytale for all the family with a heart of gold and more sass n smarts than is immediately apparent. One of my all-time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic Princess Bride and Stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory.... and just as The Princess Bride remains fresh smart and funny twenty years after its initial release I believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness of Stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions (or equivalent future device!) for many years to come.',pos
'I suppose that in 1997 Hollywood wasnt quite at the point of openly celebrating homosexuality so one might want to give some credit to those who put this movie together for having shown a little bit of courage. One simply wishes that credit could be given them for having put together a really good movie and in my opinion In & Out doesnt qualify on that count. Its the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) - a small town high school English teacher who on the eve of his wedding is outed by a former student who happens to win an Oscar and who then has to go through what can only be described as a period of self-discovery as he comes to terms with being homosexual. To me that was the first problem with this movie. Howard didnt really have to turn out to be gay. The movie would have been funnier (and perhaps even more thought provoking) had Brackett remained defiantly straight in spite of the stereotypically gay aspects to his life and the towns belief after the Oscar speech that he was gay. (In fact I thought that identifying him as gay given the presence of those stereotypes might actually have been rather insulting to the gay community as well as to straight men who like poetry and believe in dressing neatly!) <br /><br />Kline was decent enough in the role and largely carried the film. Aside from him most of the other cast members (although fine actors) were people not really noted for their success on the big screen. Folks like Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors but not big movie stars. I actually thought that the funniest (if very small) role in the movie was that of the super model Sonya played by an actress named Shalom Harlow (Speaking of stereotypes I loved her oh-so stereotypical model line I promised to do that photo shoot this afternoon. I have to shower and vomit!) In the end what really turned me off about this movie was the ridiculous ending starting with the graduation ceremony (and to be honest even if someone decided that the graduation was really necessary the movie should have ended there rather than proceeding on with the totally unnecessary nuptials at the end.) <br /><br />Basically I got a few chuckles out of this but nothing more. 3/10',neg
'My favourite story from tales from the crypt. Brion Jones was born to play the part of the maniac lumberjackaxe swinging madman Steve Dixon.Having seen him before in Tango&Cash I can state this actor never got the proper credit he deserved.

'This move was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler because it sucked bad! The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way. (Not bad tits and ass though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The wolf if that is what you can call it is hardly shown fully save his teeth. When it is fully in view you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI because the wolf runs like hes running in a treadmill and the CGI fur looks like its been waxed all shiny :)<br /><br />The movie is full of gore and blood and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed they didnt do a good job at it.<br /><br />Dont even get me started on the actors... Very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds. But then again if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks then hey where do I sign up?<br /><br />Overall boring and laughable horror.',neg
'One True Thing is the kind of movie where the audience is inspired greatly greatly inspired performances. I am not necessarily stating that the film is uplifting because it isnt. In fact the movie is down right depressing. I am trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an attending crowd.<br /><br />I cried in One True Thing enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of 1998. The characters were perfectly casted. The performances are all guaranteed Oscar Nominees especially Meryl Streep who portraits the dying Kate extremely well. Her acting alone was enough to make the movie excel to the point of recommendation and gives you a new point of view at her. I also thought that Renée Zellweger portrayed a realistic single free-wheeling woman who has to take care of their own mother. The other cast members including William Hurt & Tom Everett Scott were also superb. The script of this movie was really fantastic. It is kind of funny how the movies concept has to do with the controversial happenings in my local area. You see I live near Lansing Michigan and right now a big issue here is assistant suicide doctor Jack Kavorkians (excuse my miss-spelling if so) ways have just been outlawed. The public will vote on this according to their beliefs in November After watching One True Thing it really changed my perspective at this topic although I have always believed in it. Without revealing the ending of the film I will simply say that suicide is a distant theme in this movie and I think it fits in accurately with the gorgeous story. Overall this movie does indeed have more emotional impact than Titanic Saving Private Ryan or any other tearjerker released in the last few years. I think that is because the main idea of this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day so it relates better to an audience. And indeed that this could happening to you.',pos
'I thought that Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a woman of 30 with no children I still seem to really enjoy these humorous witty animated movies. Sid is the best character I have seen in some time better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really humorous and I did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the movie at least 15 times (I own it obviously) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasions...yesstill). My favourite scene is the part where Sid says Oh oh oh I love this game! and Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the tigers...Pack of wolves pack of bears pack of fleas pack of whiskers pack of noses pack a derm? pack of lies pack of troubles pack a wallop pack of birds pack of flying fish... or however that part goes! That is THE funniest part about the whole movie although I also really enjoyed the humour behind putting sloths on the map and many other parts as well. The only animated movie that can remotely compare to Ice Age is Brother Bear.',pos
'One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories. Farewell my Concubine The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. The film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience -- the hallmark of much Hollywood and especially Disney films.<br /><br />In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. Along an having lost his only son many years earlier he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art. But the son eventually is found out to be a girl. From there the story get very interesting with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera -- a regional operatic style related to Peking Opera. Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liangs portrayal of a male playing the female role in Chinese Opera. It may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality.',pos

'THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as hesitant lovers. She has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer. Hes an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her. Their affair such as it is is doomed from the start and she knows it but goes along with it anyway. Two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this: Woods Jane Fonda hairdo that is never mussed no matter what and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick. She sings it for four or five or six minutes so you know its classic padding between commercials. It also is one of the worst songs ever written and the woman doing Woods singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery. Also keep an eye out for all the peasant tops and dresses. By comparison Wagner looks relatively timeless with close-cropped hair and sporting a series of classic suits.',neg
'I have been living in Istanbul for 24 years and I (a 39 years of experience would suggest) do know what Istanbul has gone through all those years.<br /><br />Faith Akin is still quite young (born in 1973) and falling in the great mistake of being ORIENTALIST when looking at Turkey (just as his other movie Gegen Die Wand did) This movie SERIOUSLY LACK contemporary urban Turkish life AND MISLEADS the audience when giving out (quite false) clues as to the geographical and cultural spreading of Istanbul.<br /><br />Anyone who could speak Turkish could easily attest that many underground bands & groups depicted in the movie (Siyasiyabend for one ) are SO MISERABLE and their members cannot even speak a proper language that they cannot be taken as representatives of the contemporary Turkish music. Much less a piece of crap which many Turkish listeners even do not know about at all.<br /><br />We Turks have long been accustomed to superficious westerners who look at Turkey with some Orientalist point of view: trying to fit the actual Turkish image into their mind molds.. What is new in this movie is the fact that now a Turkish originated director (Faith Akin) is making the same mistake: Looking at Turkey with some false western glasses and scrambling to depict it as if he understands better. All of a vain effort.<br /><br />Just ask any Turkish friend of yours: What sort of a musical documentary is this without mentioning the names : Zeki Muren Baris Manco Ajda Pekkan Teoman Muslum Gurses Ibrahim Tatlises Ferdi Ozbegen?.. and many others who have SHAPED so far the real MUSIC we are listening today?<br /><br />Faith Akin has a long long lesson to learn before babbling away and confusing other peoples minds with false images about the contemporary Turkish Music.',neg

The camera work was so nauseating and so distracting that my wife and I considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture.

Buh Bye! - callus beyond even low-life Hollywood standards...<br /><br />#3) There are so many holes in this horrible waste of time called a movie that you can drive all the jeeps trucks camels and any extra stuff through it. Pass - really complete and total waste of time - Oh! There is a great dance sequence (yes only one - as in dance sequence - regardless of quality) great belly dancing - but NOT worth watching just for this.<br /><br />Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever take acting lessons?) for better Indo-Pak conflict movies... In fact Veer-Zaara is pretty damned good - 7.5/8 Id say!',neg
'Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity. In other words when he could act he didnt have to talk like some street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he became a promoter of the F word also. This might be the kind of society that they actually live in but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company. I dont recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity but it was something like this. It shows a lack of intelligence poor language skills and disrespect for all those that have to listen. Maybe it is time that Al takes some acting courses again to sharpen his talent. Oh yes the movie... Probably the worse thing that McConaughey has played in. Hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people. Rene Russo as always was hot.',neg
'I saw this drama by cable TV. Although I saw just two series I love this drama. Im waiting for more series will be aired by cable.<br /><br />Even though it describes horrible absurd situation in a prisoners camp this one shows us an indomitable spirit warmth friendship and humanity. They dont know whether they can survive or not but kept their hope strongly without being discouraged by adversity.<br /><br />I know this movie is not realistic like other war documentary but I dont want to blame for it. It makes me believe the strong will of people in the most difficult situation. <br /><br />Private Bill  especially this episode touched deep in my heart.<br /><br />I remember every scene. I always hate mathematics. But after seeing this drama I can understand something about mathematics... Mathematics is his connection between past and present also symbolizes eternity.<br /><br />Time light and memory framed in a circle.<br /><br />Like other victims of war he lost his lover by irresistible fate. Im immersed in his time and memory as if I experienced same thing.<br /><br />He experienced the great loss but he has pure passion of study.<br /><br />He started his study in the camp his joy of realize<br /><br />I believe his dedication of study sustained him.<br /><br />I saw it several times but the meaning of this film never faded. Every time I saw it I feel same deep emotion.<br /><br />* Their songs are beautiful harmonious<br /><br />Im sorry that I cant listen OST.',pos
'4 out of 10<br /><br />A somewhat unbelievable storyline with some haunted-house type shocks that really dont fit in.<br /><br />Gary Oldhams performance is very erratic...not so much the quality of the performance but the consistency. His character does not behave in a consistent manner. Sometimes calm/relaxed/methodical/thoughtful sometimes violent/loud/almost crazed. Its just not believable. <br /><br />Have many 80s movies dated badly? Will they be more enjoyable 20 years from now?<br /><br />',neg
'Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever. Seriously. If I could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor I would have thrashed Pierre to within an inch of his life. No one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid both at the same time except maybe Heathcliff in Emily Brontes Wuthering Heights. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre I need a large glass of brandy. Never have I been so angry at a main character. Ok having said that Pola X is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes Ive ever seen in any film....which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking....and Im talking graphic here by the way. Pola X will beat the hell out of you though so make sure youre up for it if you decide to watch it.',pos
'One of my favorite bum actors C. Tom Howell stars in this tepid remake of WOTW. He runs around a lot while a CGI-generated spider-like machine goes around killing everyone. The budget for this one obviously was pretty low. It also was one of The Asylum productions. Have you seen any of those? Yikes! I am not sure why anyone would have made this while the big-budget Spielberg version was slaying them at the box office. And if truth be told neither version is all that hot. The George Pal version from the 1950s remains the best representation of the H.G. Wells novel primitive special effects and all. Perhaps because Gene Barry was much more convincing in the lead than Howell or Tom Cruise.',neg
'Its been a long time since I saw this mini-series and I am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time. <br /><br />Most of the components of A Perfect Spy the adaptation of LeCarrés finest novel in my opinion are top-drawer. Outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay the latter written by Arthur Hopcraft who was also I believe the screenwriter for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy with Alec Guinness a few years before.<br /><br />The actors are mostly very good some superb like Alan Howards Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnallys Ricky Pym. Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle. The passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done. So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming. The only jolt comes after the character of Magnus Pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor to those of a noticeably too-old Peter Egan just fresh out of Oxford. But this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole.<br /><br />Egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be upset emotionally ie cry. None of the actors have a very easy time with these moments aside from the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for all shes worth and steals the episode with ease.<br /><br />Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym. She has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife which Mary Pym is. Rüdiger Weigang is splendid as Axel amusing ironic and brilliant. I also enjoyed Sarah Badels camp turn as the Baroness.<br /><br />The British view of Americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes. When the Yanks have come abroad to confab with Bo Brammell (head of MI6) the American contingent are portrayed as empty-headed buffoons who appear to have memorized a lot of long words out of the Dictionary and spiced them liberally with American jargon and psycho babble much to the bemused scorn of the English. <br /><br />The humor and sadness are subtly blended. LeCarré has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and Hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy yet wistful atmosphere of the original.<br /><br />Not a perfect production (what is?) and yet the best of the LeCarré adaptations to reach film or television to date. <br /><br />Highly recommended to all spy-thriller lovers and especially LeCarré fans. DVD available from Acorn.',pos
'STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />David (Johnathon Schaech) and Tish (Lori Heuring) are a couple in Budapest on business commitments and staying at a luxury hotel. One night they meet an attractive woman at a nightclub and invite her back to their place where they end up in a threesome. All is well until David receives some negatives in the mail and he and Tish end up being blackmailed. But when some people involved in the deception are found murdered things get messy and they are forced to enter the seedy underground world of pornography and hardcore bondage to track down the woman who may hold the key to everything.<br /><br />Whereas the original film dealt with the concept of snuff films this straight to DVD sequel deals with the more wholesome (!!!) theme of threesomes and sleazy sex. It plays like a porn film a cheap piece of titillation with plenty of hot T/A action going on. If this sounds like your idea of a good film youll probably like it but youd probably be more at home in a porn shop than a video store.<br /><br />This tries to copy the original films dark and voyeuristic feel but while it does a pretty good job of this it still cant hold up to that of the originals. It has an apathetic story with a dodgy narrative flow. And compared to Cage Schaech comes across as interminably wooden.<br /><br />Better than I thought itd be I suppose and better than your average one of these DVD direct sequels that seem to be coming out a lot these days but really havent we seen enough? **',neg
'Three flash-backs introduce the main characters (Abu Jaffar and the Princess) who will interact with Ahmad; three are the songs each linked to those same characters. Three times does Ahmad pronounce the absolute word Time in his declaration of love to the Princess answering her three questions at their first of three meetings. So strong is the impression he causes that the Princess will resist the three attempts by Jaffar to conquer her - by three successive ploys: deceit hypnosis and memory erasing. Yet Jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman: the whip the power and the sword. Three is the number of flying entities: the mechanical-horse the Genie and the The Genie and the magic carpet. The Genie offers three wishes to Abu at their first of three encounters; three times does the Genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges and three are his considerations about human frailty before he departs. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn (armed guards giant-spider and giant-octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu the future the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save Ahmad and the Princess and the bow-and-arrow to execute Jaffar. Theres magic in the number three and there is magic in this movie.',pos
'I saw that The Foreigner was ranked in the Bottom 100 movie listings here on IMDb so I wasnt expecting much when I tuned into it on the USA channel a week back but I did have hopes. Belly Of The Beast (which aired a month ago) was a mess but it had great scenery and photography and some pretty cool moments scattered throughout so I thought that this movie might have some of the same. <br /><br />Alas this movie fails the standards of basic watch-ability in almost every way. The screenplay comes off as the bastard offspring of a John LeCarre novel and a Richard Ludlum movie but done by people with none of those worthy writers talent for plot and characterization. Instead what we got is a glum mean-spirited nihilistic cryptic mares nest of muddled motives tangled alliances and back-shootings. And chest shootings. And bombings. And eviscerations. This carries over to the directorial style which relies on hackneyed grainy shot/slow motion shots every 10 seconds along with wire work and hyperactive jump cuts. These filmic devices that were stale 10 years ago when MTV directors used them for Whitesnake videos and the director works them like a punch press hoping to inject some weird art-house techno thriller coolness into the proceedings. <br /><br />Segal himself is just awful in this. He spends the entire film talking in a hoarse throaty half-whisper and alternating between two expressions: looking like he is sucking on a lemon while someone waves a small turd under his nose or looking constipated. And hes so chunky (and vain about it) that he never actually takes off his knee length duster on camera. I understand that its hard to keep the girth under control as a male actor ages (although Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never seemed to have that problem). But you deal with it by being honest about it and by growing as an actor not by hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and floor length robes. <br /><br />So I cant really tell whats going on and the movie doesnt give me a reason to care about whats going on and the protagonist is completely one dimensional and visually unappealing. Not a recipe for a good movie experience. <br /><br />Oddly most of the set designs and scenery are atmospheric and striking; in fact if you were to freeze the film on almost any given scene that wasnt a close-up of Seagal you would be struck by the care and professionalism of the lightingcolors and composition and by how beautiful the Eastern European settings are. But dressing up a rotten egg as a Faberge egg cant make it edible. And the proceedings are rotten at heart. <br /><br />There are cool movies (like Versus) and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies (like Underworld) and there are paranoia conspiracy thrillers (like The Bourne Identity and its remake with Matt Damon). And then there is this thing which cant make up its mind what it wants to be pretends to be all these things and fails because it has no guts or soul. <br /><br />This is a movie made by professionals with an actual budget so you cant really put it in the same class as Manos Killer Shrews or Hobgoblins. But Id rather watch all three of those movies back-to-back several times than watch The Foreigner again even once.',neg
'I feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other. They may have faults but bitterness and put-downs have no place with these girls. Try to find that on TV or in the usual movies. It is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine--wearing beautiful feminine dresses and shoes. Contrast that with the apparel in stores today i.e. raggedy and faded jeans and jackets etc. The story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting. I know that it is animated but it still gives you a feeling that families can stick together and come out okay. I would recommend this movie for boys and girls alike.',pos
'I have to agree with Cal-37 its a great movie specially for the family Kelly Linch is beautiful the little girl is really talented and cute of course Jim Belushi has earned his strips!

'The really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget Halestorm Entertainment has had to work with. All involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash. Not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best. The soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop PC. The worst part of all is that I actually sat through the whole thing. I think just because I couldnt believe that I had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater I was watching it in had actually agreed to show the film.',neg

'I didnt approach Still Crazy with any real anticipation. Just another rocknroll picture I figured... good nostalgia for the baby boomers. This film is partially that but so much more. Brian Gibson the director previously helmed a biography of Tina Turner and is quite successful in his style. I suppose it is fitting that this was his last film.<br /><br />The cast is well-chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as the bands frontman. Actor-turned-director Bruce Robinson appears as the bands washed-up guitarist. He does a superb job even though he hasnt appeared on film since the late 70s. If youre looking for an touching and funny film (with some great songs) youve found it.<br /><br />7.4 out of 10',pos
'My friends and I rented this for Bad Movie Night with high hopes but The Brain was something of a letdown. The Brain itself is gloriously goofy-looking but it mostly just sits on its little platform. Who thought that it would be cool that the Brain only gets to munch on three people throughout 94 drawn-out minutes? This movie has a number of things going for it at first including an Estevez-knockoff lead playing a rebellious genius (were told that his enormous intellect is misdirected into his elaborate pranks and school stunts which include putting krazy glue on someones chair). It also has some great lines a hilariously out-of-shape and out-of-breath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere and yeah some chick gets naked. However the director desperately needs some schooling in the art of pacing. During the last half things just start to drag on and on with at least 3 or 4 pointless boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot. The scenes inside the PRI complex are especially bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same stairwell. I couldve fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour- more cheese more gore more nudity more Brain action. If youre going to make a bad horror movie at least give me something cool to look at while my superego shuts down. Maybe the director was trying to really bring the audience into his movie- I started feeling like one of the zombified townsfolk by the end of this crapfest.',neg
'If you watched this movie you know why I said Jesus Jesus Jesus. Hehehe!!! Every time they said Jesus Jesus Jesus... I laughed thinking Jesus Jesus Jesus why did I rent this movie? I cannot believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreaful acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a big fun of him... but I really prefer an actor not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow hollow and annoying as hell. I was happy when they both were popped in the street.<br /><br />The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well. The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake ruined it all. It would have been much enjoyable without him.<br /><br />By the way the music was OK but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes low motion and things like that. Something misplaced for this cops movie I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake.',neg
'Once in a while in Indian cinema there comes along a movie like Sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. And den just once in a while(hopefully) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own. A standard so low it can never be broken. Ram Gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance. To take a classic like Sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and I cant believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever. What Aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly ull need a contest to pick the worst. The realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of actors parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events. One star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote. its time for RGV to wake up to the reality of his failure and conjure up another different plot that can be categorized under cinema.',neg
'Somehow CHANGI lost out in the AFI Awards to MY BROTHER JACK. The latter a high-quality adaptation of George Johnstons immortal novel was outstanding - but in my opinion not as good as CHANGI. I have heard that many critics dismissed CHANGI as being irrelevant unimportant historically inaccurate or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI is outstanding. More than that. Brilliant. Its not supposed to be a documentary - certainly I can forgive the actual Changi survivors (or indeed any survivors of a POW camp) for being disappointed with the production - but to the rest of us CHANGI represents the remarkable power of mateship in times of extreme adversity. It contains a part of the Australian culture that appears to be diminishing as times become easier and less challenging but which we should never forget: Australians were respected worldwide after Gallipoli and WW2 for their comradery and sense of humour. Rating: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PARADISE ROAD; THE LAST BULLET; THE SUGAR FACTORY.',pos
'Theres been a spate of recent surfing movies that I seem to haphazardly run across without advance warning. I caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was! The focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the 60s Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Hell I could watch a movie just about Laird Hamilton - one of this generations great athletes - so the rest is just gravy. Theres loads of good surfing mixed in with interviews of past and present surfing stars in pleasant relaxed and unpretentious fashion. Of all the surfing movies Ive seen this tells the big-wave story the best and I think its my favorite. Enjoy!',pos

'I really wanted to be able to give this film a 10. Ive long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman films to date (and maybe it still will be--I have yet to watch the Schumacher films again). Im also starting to become concerned about whether Im somehow subconsciously being contrarian. You see I always liked the Schumacher films. As far as I can remember they were either 9s or 10s to me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton directed films are far superior. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time around--I ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as I might I just couldnt help feel that Batman Returns just has too many small direction plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.<br /><br />But Burton _almost_ trumps the problems with sheer force of style and even though there are a lot of small flaws Batman Returns is still a great film especially if youre a Burton fan as Batman Returns has just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe.<br /><br />The film begins strongly with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces ready to vomit. Later they have the baby in a small cage. Finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the Gotham City River. The baby ends up becoming Batman villain The Penguin (Danny DeVito).<br /><br />Meanwhile Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the films evil capitalist comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He is planning on duping Gotham City in various ways and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary the timid Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots Grissom tries to get rid of her but she is rescued by cats becoming Catwoman.<br /><br />While all of this is going on The Penguin who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy despite having less than benevolent ulterior motives.<br /><br />Before re-watching Burtons Batman films this time I didnt remember just how little the films are about Batman (Michael Keaton). Its almost as if Burton didnt feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains especially The Penguin. Batman doesnt appear very often especially in the beginning of the film and surprisingly often were watching him watching The Penguin.<br /><br />Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw I cant say that I do even if Id like to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The villains stories are interesting too and as an origin story for two major Batman villains Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot.<br /><br />However there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw. The Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding but even though theyre frequently on screen we never get to learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in Tod Brownings Freaks (1932) available with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli but he just doesnt have the space to use them.<br /><br />For that matter he hardly has space to explore Catwoman. The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as The Penguin but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long. So the bulk of the Catwoman scenes had to be excised. Of course all of this barely leaves any room for Batman. Burton has Batman turn very dark in the publics eye in this film and unusually he never bothers to resolve this. As far as we know at the end Gothamites still think that Batman is a murdering lunatic. Thats an interesting development but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.<br /><br />As for the script although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters its clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. A lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented but often this is fairly subtle and/or complex (of course sometimes it is very blatant or transparent too). It helps to look at Batman Returns as a more poetic film as I believe was the intention. This also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions including from minor characters are done in service of a general mood or style and that style works very well.<br /><br />Dark is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in a word and whether thats a positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love dark. So for me Burtons style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script. In many ways Batman Returns is like an insane campy horror film with beautifully eerie production design. Like Batman Burton is still making many references to other films but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well theres still a slight Star Wars reference) he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) (including that Max Schreck was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there) Motel Hell (1980) the aforementioned Freaks Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal dark edge to it) and zombie films--made most explicit in The Penguins final scene.<br /><br />In terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general feel of the story the characters and so on--this couldnt be a stronger 10.',pos
'At the end of Dragon Heat all I could think of was why I bothered sitting through the whole thing.<br /><br />The films premise is interesting and that - as well as Maggie Q - is what attracted me to the film in the first place. But was I ever disappointed. Writer-director Daniel Lee cant hold a candle to the likes of John Woo Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen.<br /><br />This has to be one of the most annoyingly-directed films I have ever seen. Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style - and I use that phrase incredibly loosely - that he fills the film with completely needless black-and-white stills freeze frames slow-motion fast-motion and other visual nonsense. I suppose he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue.<br /><br />The action scenes are nothing special and play out like some hopped-up music video more than anything else. There is little to care about any of the characters - including two supposedly professional snipers who couldnt hit the broad side of a barn from the inside! - who are then laden with some of the cheesiest dialogue I have seen in one of these Hong Kong actioners.<br /><br />The plot is devoid of any twists and turns - from the initial set-up everything unfolds in predictable fashion - and Lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters back stories in case we didnt get it the first several times. This is awfully amateurish writing and film-making and wastes the talents of Sammo Hung Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Though to be frank I am hard-pressed to remember Biehn being in any good film that was not directed by James Cameron.<br /><br />If you really are in the mood for a great Hong Kong actioner you are much better off sticking to some of the staples - John Woos The Killer (1989) and Hard-Boiled (1992) Ringo Lams City on Fire (1987) - which Quentin Tarantino stole for Reservoir Dogs (1992) - or his Point Blank (1967) remake Full Contact (1992). Or even check out Yuens So Close (2002) a supremely entertaining yet preposterous popcorn flick. And theres always the terrific French police actioner The Nest (2002).<br /><br />True most if not all are a bit over-the-top but they were films that remain exciting thrilling and even suspenseful. They have characters we care about and mind-blowing action sequences.<br /><br />Dragon Heat on the other hand is just terribly mediocre. The trouble is that Lee has not made a bad action film he has made a dull one.',neg
'Why you ask does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the almighty? Well its deductive logic my friends you see I know God exists because Satan does how else would my poor eyes have been soiled on such a horrendous film? Yes there is no doubt about it on a cold Friday in the year 2006 Satan possessed me and forced me to watch this film. He what? You wonder; the devil makes little girls spit up vomit and climb ceilings why would he waste his time in making you watch this film? My only conclusion to that query is that Satan believes watching Camp Fear is the worst form of mortal punishment not gouging out your eyes or making you speak in tongues instead making you sit mindlessly through one and half hours of the most awful film making ever. Can this film be as terrible as he says? Yes my friend watching this film is the equivalent of getting kicked in the sack about fifty million times maybe more. But maybe I am being too harsh this film does have a few moments in it the beginning for example starts in a sorority house with a lot of topless girls; now never being in a sorority I am unsure if girls really do this but hey one can always pray. Now after the five minutes of boobs and butt cheeks has ended we are presented with a scene on campus at an all girls college; the girls themselves (about eight in all) are in an archaeological class where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds. Flash forward the professor of the class (who happens to be the only male at this girls college apparently) takes a handful of his nubile students plus girlfriend to a remote lake in the mountains their quests to find ancient Indian artifacts; yeah right professor we know what angle your pitching. Now this is where the movie gets going the group of five four girls one guy stops at a gas station to get some directions but lo and behold a biker gang pulls up and harasses the girls only to eventually leave them alone and go their separate ways. Moving on they get to a campsite consisting of four logs and some trees and then things start to go horribly wrong. First the prof. and his girlfriend go wandering away to have some alone time when one of the girls takes it upon herself to find them only to be captured by some unknown force. Continuing on the other two girls begin searching for the missing girl when the bikers plus one drunk guy come looking for them their plan to rape the girls and do horrible things to them. The movie goes on with something about a druid needing four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from some kind of water monster before the year two thousand; but their is a hitch to this plan Mr. Druid one of the girls is devirginized right before us so away goes that plan. Now since I said there would be spoilers Ill go ahead and ruin the end of the movie for you the four girls get taken drugged with some green goo and then are ready to be sacrificed after one of them is killed the two remaining bikers and the prof. come to save them; they stand upon a ledge where the not lead biker says I think I can make it down there! only to leap down and break his leg. The prof. runs at the guy and gets subdued only leaving the once rape-minded-now-heroic biker left to fend off the 63 giant druid. First he makes a pathetic attempt with a stick then pulls a knife the knife reflects some lazer beam within a gold snakes mouth and lights the druid on fire instantaneously. Afterwords they carry the wounded away via emergency stick stretchers and ponder if everything is really over only to have the lake bubble showing the monster within it still lives. In a nutshell that is the film and this is my review which unfortunately will go unread by most eyes since this is only the fifth posted review for a film that has been out for fifteen years. Thankfully Satan can only get to some of us and not all. The Judge would like to make one heartfelt apology to the poor girl at Circuit City I am going to let borrow this movie; Im sorry Sheila please dont hate me for letting you watch this.',neg
'I watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didnt bag out that one though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills going. The effects were better and the costume looked heaps better then this movie.<br /><br />I borrowed this one with an open mind i am also a fan of ken shamrock (former ufc superfight champ) and was hoping it was a decent movie.<br /><br />Boy was i wrong the movie sucked the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary the storyline was SO predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode as i already would guess what will happen the music was so bad with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen.<br /><br />Overall avoid this crappy movie.<br /><br />Save some money.',neg
'I love a good Western movie but this was more like watching a play on stage or an act at the local street carnival show. I could only stand 38 minutes of it in hopes that it would improve but it only got worse and I had to end it. Each actor(s) stated the lines as if reading directly from the script or cue cards. There was too much predictability to the lines and actions not as if a natural occurrence or conversation. The wig on Rachel Kimsey was obvious. The actresses playing Native American sisters could have played non-native parts and should have. Wardrobe for the Native Americans could have been better and a little more authentic looking. If I decide to watch it with any friends in the future I will do so not with the expectations of watching a good Western but with the expectations of watching an amateur comedy film production.',neg
'Horrible ending - and I cant believe Moore spent a year coming up with it. Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs which Hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks. This was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3.5 years. Now the first 1.5 hours were action packed though absurd in the premise and then it deteriorated into a slow painful sophomoric dissolution of the series. Unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was. Were we to think more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in a-materialism I would reread Daniel Quinns Ishmael. Absurd to think 38K people would give up everything for a fresh start. Absurd to throw in a disappearing Kara and a reappearing Baltar and Six. Absurd to throw in the Mitochondrial Eve. Just absurd.',neg

'I cant understand why many seem to hate this.<br /><br />This movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and Biblical epics of the fifties using set pieces props and costumes similar to those seen in other movies. Here however the story attempts to run through all of human history with a frame story about the human race being on trial with a guilty verdict meaning h-bombs will go off all over the world. The prosecutor is the devil played with fiendish glee by Vincent Price. OK so its a little hokey calling the defender The Spirit of All Men but I think thats one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm. The Spririt of Man is incidentally played quite well by Ronald Coleman in his last film. It is also the last movie in which Groucho Harpo and Chico Marx all appear but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Minuet buying Manhattan from the Indians in a scene played purely for campy humor. Chico isnt funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat and Harpo we are told is meant to be Isaac Newton discovering gravity. Most of the other performances are well done though.<br /><br />Other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness. There is something called The Great Clock of Outer Space which when striking midnight may signal the end of the world.<br /><br />But at its heart the movie addresses the problems of WMDs and the eternal question of whether Man is basically good or basically evil; and poses it in what I think is an interesting way. Also anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie.',neg
'Every once in a while an indie comes along that has an awesome cast and a story that sounds really interesting and cant-miss but the movie sucks. Some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are Levity and The Safety Of Objects and now heres The United States Of Leland.<br /><br />Said awesome cast includes Ryan Gosling Kevin Spacey Don Cheadle Jena Malone Lena Olin Michelle Williams Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays Leland P. Fitzgerald the teenage son of a famous author (Spacey) who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime (murdering a retarded child) but doesnt remember it and doesnt seem to have any sort of motive. <br /><br />Don Cheadle plays a teacher in juvenile hall who is trying to understand Leland (and also exploit him by writing a book about him) and Jena Malone is his ex-girlfriend. We see their deteriorating relationship (due to her heroin addiction) in flashback. Sounds like an awesome little drama huh? I thought so too. <br /><br />The fact is that this movie is just badly badly written. The dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and laden with irritating platitudes about life the characters are all two-dimensional indie cliches and while it does manage to make Leland sympathetic in some ways it glosses over his crime. <br /><br />For the most part theres no problem with the acting. Gosling (who was Oscar-worthy in The Believer) is a tremendously talented young actor but the way theyre written none of these characters (least of all Leland) even feel like real people so theres not much he can do but mumble his ridiculous lines and look sad. <br /><br />Jena Malone is the most memorable. She has one of the most expressive faces Ive ever seen. Even playing an underwritten character in a bad movie like this she can break your heart with one look. When shes got good material to work with (as in Donnie Darko or The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys) shes really amazing. <br /><br />But this is not good material. Maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been something worthwhile but as it is The United States Of Leland is ponderous inert and for a movie that seems in love with how deep it is its really shallow.',neg
'I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK:TNG they were fine shows but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other TREK shows as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. Sure there were a few throwaway episodes that were not connected to the rest but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.<br /><br />And speaking of funny I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasnt so dreadfully serious. In this way I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack ONeill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson--its really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.<br /><br />To truly appreciate SG-1 you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power. And if you dont like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance then sci-fi is probably NOT the genre for you.',pos
'After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK I decided to check it out given its sci-fi/adventure/camp pedigree: I knew I’d be in for a thoroughly silly ride – but it was also astoundingly bad! Anyway perhaps appropriately given the characters involved the script rips off many sci-fi titles then of recent vintage – SOYLENT GREEN (1973) ZARDOZ (1974) LOGAN’S RUN (1976; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self-same sets!) STAR WARS (1977) ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! <br /><br />The plot is simple but not exactly engaging: from the title one can deduce that water has become scarce on the planet where all of this takes place – so our ragtag buccaneer heroes take it upon themselves to steal ice blocks from the tyrannical Templar(!) rulers. Also involved is a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby daughter of Bing!) in search of her father the deposed king; by the way the cast includes another famous offspring: Anjelica Huston (daughter of John) as one of the pirate band – thankfully the actress’ mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten in the wake of her winning an Oscar (under her father’s guidance no less) for PRIZZI’S HONOR (1985). Since STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as the “Supreme Commander? the film-makers opted to have a screen legend of their own – 78-year old John Carradine (who’s seen strapped to a sort of operating table during his one brief scene!).<br /><br />The most notable bits (for all the wrong reasons) are: the alien using the toilet; the castration machine; the clumsy antics (including karate-style combat!) of the inevitable robot companions; the goofy slave/eunuch make-up worn at one point by the heroes; the recurring attacks by the “space herpies? (whatever that is); the climax in which the characters are made to age when going through a time-warp (Crosby becomes pregnant gives birth and sees her son grow up in the space of 30 seconds while leading man Robert Urich himself is replaced by John Ford stalwart Hank Worden for this scene!) – incidentally the jump-cuts adopted here (intending to denote the rapid passage of time) are not only unsuccessful but downright irritating.',neg
'I bought this film as I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit.<br /><br />First off let me say the acting is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose. Patsy Kensit is so-so but not too convincing in some scenes and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her Hotel Room is utterly meaningless rubbish. Ms Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this film. Ms Rubins Character is at first innocent then sexy as she plays Stephen Baldwins Character (Travis)for a fool. The supporting cast includes Adam Baldwin(no relation to his more famous namesakes) & M.Emmet Walsh who has appeared in many films also I noticed Art Evans who was one of John Mclanes allies in Die Hard 2. The Movie is decent and there are a few nude scenes with Rubin & Kensit a bit of action but this is certainly not a fast moving or intelligent thriller. There is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and Stephen Balwins character is wearing sunglasses and when you see him again the area around his eyes etc is painted black instead then the sunglasses reappear later when they are leaving the crime scene and police are in pursuit a very obvious error in editing. <br /><br />If you are fans of either of the ladies or either Baldwin then you may find something to like here but others should steer clear. This is a reasonable but unremarkable thriller and not really worth more than a couple of dollars if you want it.',neg
'Across the country and especially in the political landscape people with any kind of political ambition should take time out to see this film. The movie is called  City Hall  and with little imagination its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It just so happens to open in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort. His right-hand man is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) an equally bright individual whos ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office. Everything points in that direction until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor. A six year old boy and a police officers death are blamed on a career criminal whos questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up by political pay-offs and city corruption involving union leaders like Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo corrupt judicial officials like Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also implicated are party officials like Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) who works for the probation office of New York. But it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic. ****',pos

'A true yawner and a bad film even for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan film or even a reasonably good one but this one falls way short of the mark. Charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power. The mystery is very pedestrian and the acting doesnt fare much better. The only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces but after that the pickings are rather slim. Benson Fong is here as Tommy Chan and pairs up with Chans daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? He is pretty decent but looks like he is straining to carry the film. What I noticed most was the way the film was shot. Chan director Phil Rosen of whom I generally like most of his entries uses lots of long shots with no action(like Charlies initial walk into the house from outside). Why? The film is only 64 minutes long for crying out loud! Shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than he was accustomed to. This probably isnt the worst Chan film ever made but up to now it is the worst I have sat through unfortunately.',neg
'Blank Check is a movie that I saw on TV one day and like most movies they air on TV Blank Check wasnt that good. First of all no one I have ever met has seen Blank Check and that includes people that grew up in the 90s. Also Blank Check wont be remembered in the 00s either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixars films. I wouldnt call Blank Check a bad film but its not really entertaining either. (Or at least it isnt to anyone over the age of 6) Blank Check isnt a entertaining film because nothing about it is original. Everything just makes you go what havent I seen this before? Blank Check rips off and tries to cash in on everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (Which strangely enough both have Macaulay Culkin in it) Blank Check isnt a bad movie but it deserves to fade into obscurity.',neg
'Sorry folks but all of you that say this is a great documentary... and that award it won at Sundance... well youve all been duped. Ive heard for a few years how I had to see this documentary and I finally watched it. Maybe in 1999 when it came out and reality TV didnt have such a dominant presence in the industry this movie would have seemed entertaining. But Mike and Mark are so obviously playing themselves Mike and Mark. At times they are funny and some of the lines seem off the cuff but mostly they do not ring true. They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes the people are real they are not actors but its put on its exaggeration of themselves and its so obvious that its hard to believe so many people think its the real deal. I wasnt fooled so it was actually a tad boring. Mildly amusing but not missing much if you miss it.',neg
'Computing . Can there be anything more boring ? Sitting in front of a computer all day typing away at some keys all day every day  tap tap tapping . Thats much of the problem with this movie  the heroine sits in front of a computer VDU tapping the keys and no matter how many looks of agitation she gives  or how much suspenseful notes the composer strikes or how many extreme close ups the director uses theres not much excitement down to the fact that theres few things less exciting than watching somebody on a computer <br /><br />Theres a few other problems too much of them factual errors regarding how computers work . Is it possible to hack into a computer that is both turned off and not connected to the internet ? I guess that when THE NET was made 10 years ago very few people would understand how computers worked so the screenwriters would have been able to BS at length but since we now live in a global village where nearly every household in the western world has their own computer the audience are certainly very clued up on the factual errors of this movie . And of course theres too many instances where someone acts stupid or out of character at crucial times in order to progress the plot which makes THE NET a very mediocre movie',neg
'This film is wonderful in every way that modern action adventures are not. Take some time. Relax enjoy. Think. People who see this movie as slow or plodding or dull really need to take a week off and watch it several times until their short attention span mind comes to grips with the possibility of being involved with a cause or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because it isnt hurrying to make the points you so emphatically need it to make in the short time alloted. At first I was apprehensive of Brosnan playing a native American. Given the story line though I think it was apt casting. Now back to my hermiting. -Jahfre',pos
'This is the worst adaption of a classic story I have ever seen. They needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick.<br /><br />The songs rarely move along the story. They seem to be thrown in at random. The flying scene with Marley is pointless and ludicrous.<br /><br />Its not only one of the worst movies Ive seen but it is definitely the worst musical Ive ever seen.<br /><br />Its probably only considered a classic because A Christmas Carol is such a classic story.

I liked his performance in `The Object of My Affection very much and I really expected a good work. However I found this film a complete mess. The story has a very confused screenplay and the characters are not well developed. Further the low-budget special effects do not help much.

'You cant help but marvel at Hitchcocks early work. Saboteur for example is so slick and quick that its hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago. Theres some propaganda elements but theyre woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later. You also get some previews of stuff that Hitchcock would do later--like using a national landmark as a backdrop. This time its the Statue of Liberty. In North by Northwest of course its Mt. Rushmore. Youll also recognize things that pop up later in Rear Window and Vertigo in Saboteur but lets not give away the show. Robert Cummings is excellent as is the oh-so-charming Otto Kruger. Look for Hitchcocks mini-western in this one. It happens quickly so dont blink.',pos
'About a year ago I finally gave up on American television. I thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in England showed me some programs that included The Office Extras Blackadder and The League of Gentlemen. It was then that I decided to switch to British television. Among all the shows listed above The League of Gentlemen is easily the most dark and twisted of them all providing guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy Ive seen yet. Characters included are the most unhappily married couple a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that go unsaid (probably for the best) a deranged couple that look over a local shop that only caters to local people and the worst veterinarian ever. This program is one of the best Ive seen.',pos
'As a Pokémon fan I enjoyed this movie very much. It introduces new legendary Pokémon (as each movie does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. I however do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to enjoy it(This includes MOST adults). Some of the lines were corny but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to English. The animation was beautiful although there were a couple parts that did not look good. And although the villain is kind of corny I think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains and I guarantee you that they arent all like this one. Those who did not like it I say to each his own but Pokémon fans will love it.',pos
'I recently got the chance to view The Waterdance and quite liked it. I dont really understand why its called that as there isnt really any dancing going on there except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end. We are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie invalids in a hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman which is a very sweet story.Unfortunately you dont get to see movies like that today. Im not stuck in a time warp im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today but I really think the movie industry is deteriorating and theres much we can learn from old movies-by old movies i mean anything from 1920-1998.',pos

'This movie was awful and an insult to the viewer. Stupid script bad casting endless boredom.<br /><br />In the usual tradition of Hollywood the government of the US is shown as always evil.

'Paris je taime (2006) is a film made up of 18 segments. You can do the math--18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story. The movie is based on the premise that you can indeed tell a story in that short amount of time. The premise works. Almost all of the segments are powerful complete and satisfying. Each presents a different aspect of the Parisian experience and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and near-great actors.<br /><br />There were so many powerful portrayals in this film that its hard to pick one or two favorites. Probably the most memorable to me were Juliette Binoche as a grieving mother in the segment Place des Victoires Gena Rowlands as an aging beauty in Quartier Latin Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in the segment Loin du 16ème and Margo Martindale as a Colorado mail carrier who has learned to speak French so she can visit Paris (14ème Arrondissement segment). <br /><br />Special mention must be given to Gulliver Hecq probably the meanest little boy to ever harass an American tourist in a Parisian Metro Station (segment Tuileries).<br /><br />This is an outstanding movie. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed.

Understanding that the story and time-period demand it I found the movie extremely slow-paced.<br /><br />Im a die-hard Aishwarya fan and I regret to say that I thought she was miscast. The role of Chokher Bali required an actress who can portray herself as subversive not innocent and naive. Everyone else gave a good performance. Tagores depiction of the human condition does come across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme.',neg

And I thought the acting was great.<br /><br />So if you want to see a fun movie. You should look for The Green Butchers. A great movie.<br /><br />I give it 10/10',pos
'The original story had all the ingredients to make a thoroughly gripping Film. But failed miserably in this version as even Cherie Lunghi was a pale imitation of what she was to become - so much so that I suspected that she must turn out to be an accomplice right to the end. Sherlock Holmes was turned into a warrior quite unlike anything every suggested by Sir Arthur Conn Doyle ? In fact it was Doctor Watson who showed what little common sense that was going. The boot blacked midget from the Andoman islands looked as though he could not fight his way out of a paper bag and what the villain was doing taking tea in Baker Street for a denouement was beyond anything that the old Scotland Yard could ever have dreamed up. So consign this TV Film to their Black Museum please.',neg
'Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. I think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the Matrix style of films. Europa is a breath of fresh air a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. The back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they are having. Other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like Hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions.<br /><br />I could talk about the effects more but I think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own and really heighten the drama of the film. A film to buy if you dont own already and one to see if you have not.<br /><br />10/10 Dont miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors.',pos
'This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57. But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better. The plot has been worked out in the worst possible way. Just a few of the awful moments in the movie A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. When on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she is instructed to pull on the flaps HUH!! Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss take my word for it!',neg
'Heres yet another film from the 80s that most people just dont know exists. This slow picturesque (the loving shots of the Montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of Costners recent Open Range which also starred Robert Duval) and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you cant sleep or on a listless Sunday afternoon. Those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting. The performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced. Glenn Close Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals as are all the supporting players and young actors. I especially liked how director Cain (who unfortunately hasnt directed anything of note since this except the first Young Guns) gives us quiet little glimpses into everyones personal grief. We dont just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents but also the confused middle sister the wayward uncle his crazy wife and the dead teenagers girlfriend. What we essentially get here is the rural Mid-Western answer to Ordinary People. Theres also shades of David Lynchs The Straight Story in some of the stoic downhome Mid-West morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit. This is one of the better and more realistic tear-jerkers of the era and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there.',pos
'Engaging entry from Europe about Czech fighter pilots flying for the RAF during WW2. Its always interesting as an American to see a new point of view on familiar events in history. Theres nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which this is filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative. Still it is compelling all the way through. There is a good balance between drama romance humor action and symbolism that is understated beautifully by the director and cast. This is a breath of fresh air after sitting through overblown and boring Hollywood epics like Pearl Harbor. A solid production all around. This is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema.',pos
'Well I dont personally like rap but I still found Fear of a Black Hat hilarious. Im sure I didnt get some inside jokes but some I knew and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after Id stopped laughing. Im a big fan of Spinal tap so naturally I had to check this out. It was deriviative from This Is Spinal Tap sometimes blatantly but this film still stood on its own as an original intelligent and funny satire. My personal favorite: Back in the time of slaves they didnt have hats to protect them from the sun so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt. Now we have hats.',pos
'I guess this goes to prove that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a buck. The concept of the film wasnt very good to start with. This movie has so many bad things about it I dont know where to start. The acting is horrible. The cinematography is marginal at best. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. Theres a reason why this movie ended up on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this and I cannot believe that 9 people actually thought this film is excellent. They must have liked the two go-go dancers. Final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside Wichita and never let anyone see it again! A 1 out of 10 rating is far better than this deserves.',neg
'In the spirit of the classic The Sting this movie hits where it truly hurts... in the heart! A prim proper female psychiatrist hungry for adventure meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals. The vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman and begs to be involved in his operation. While the movie moves kind of slow its climax and ending are stunning! Youll especially enjoy how the doctor forgives herself!',pos
'For those of you who have never heard of the movie until now (of which I presume there are many lucky people who havent) Ill summarise it for you. Ryan Gosling plays the titular character of Leland who also serves as the films narrator (a la Kevin Spacey in American Beauty but without the intelligent observations on life). Leland goes to jail for stabbing a retarded kid to death and the movie attempts to figure out why he did it. He seems to be a nice boy (if not mentally absent) and is portrayed by Gosling with a complete lack of violence anger or agenda (and if youre waiting for him to reveal his sinister side later in the movie dont waste your time-- its not that kind of movie). Once in juvenile prison Leland goes to classes taught by Pearl Madison ably portrayed by Don Cheadle (who is incapable of anything but quality even when in bad movies). Pearl attempts to unlock the mystery of Leland in an attempt to figure out how such a kid could do such a thing and so he could write a book about it later (along with being a juvenile prison teacher Pearl is also an aspiring author).<br /><br />The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the driving narrative behind the film as their talks unveil Lelands past to the audience. However to call it the central focus would imply that this meandering film had one. It does not. The United States of Leland boasts an impressive cast which seems to be to the detriment of the film. It seems as though writer/director Matthew Ryan Hodge (dont worry that you havent heard of him hes never done anything) had to give EVERY character a personal story arc and personality flaw in order to get the actors to play them. Most of these traits and stories are clichéd and most go underdeveloped and unresolved.<br /><br />Ill try and break them down here: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are the parents of the slain retarded boy (I love how the movie kept calling the kid retarded never mentally disabled. That part made me laugh inside) they apparently have a cold relationship because all suburban marriages in contemporary cinema must be cold. Their other two kids are Michelle Williams who is apparently an aspiring actress about to attend college and Jena Malone who plays the same troubled teen-archetype she always plays this time with a heroine addiction. Malone was also the girlfriend of Leland which gives him his link to his victim. Williams boyfriend who was orphaned and came to live with the family and is a baseball player looking to go to the same college as his girlfriend is played by Chris Klein. He ends up doing more with his character than any of the other bit players managing to steal the movie at times. Lena Olin is Lelands mother who seems to be perpetually sad for some reason. Kevin Spacey (also the executive producer) is Lelands cold and absentee father who is a famed novelist. Eventually Sherilyn Fenn will show up to put a wrinkle in Lelands story-- if you even care at that point. Oh yeah and theres a drug-dealing ex-boyfriend a couple of fellow juvees and a co-worker of Pearls with whom he has an affair on his long distance girlfriend with (played by Kerry Washington).<br /><br />Sorry if all that synopsis and character breakdown took so long. If it seemed meaningless and boring then youve just experienced a bit of what I did during the 108 minutes I spent watching the movie. But the unruly supporting cast of over-wrought clichés is the least of this films crimes. The biggest one is that the whole exercise is entirely pointless. We arent given a fascinating look into a troubled mind we arent given an effective explanation we arent given much of anything. Given that it sucked so much Im gonna go ahead and spoil the ending for you so that you never have to see it: Leland stabbed the retard because all Leland could see in the world was sadness and wanted to spare Corky (or whatever the victims name was) the sadness in his eyes. Its like the worst emo band in the world made an album and titled it The World Is Sad So I Killed A Retard. Oh and Leland dies in the end in a sequence so reliant of unbelievable coincidences that it would have ruined the movie if the movie didnt already suck. Of course he dies in the end because that made the movie so deep.<br /><br />Im giving the movie 2 stars because the actors themselves all did a pretty good job with the junk they were given. The scenes with Cheadle and Gosling together were even interesting on some levels. But to paraphrase the film itself you have to believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts kiddo.',neg
'I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake. I think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But theres far more wrong with this movie than just that.<br /><br />The first problem is the color. The original film was shot in black and white but what few people realize is the original was shot AFTER color film had been invented. The choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcocks. Now this is not to say that the remake should have been redone in black and white but the colors of this movie are all too wrong. The most predominant colors in the film are orange and green particularly on Marion who is not supposed to be a flashy character. The bright colors make it look like a happy movie and when horrific events take place in these color schemes it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream.<br /><br />The second problem is the lighting. This is a dark dark tale which should be highlighted by dim lighting but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the OPPOSITE direction. Most of the scenes are very brightly lit even at times when it is illogical to do so because its at NIGHT!<br /><br />Another obvious problem is Vince Vaughns performance. Yes he does pull off Norman Bates awkwardness and madness quite well I dont deny him that. But there is one element to the character that he failed to show: the softness. There should be a certain deceptive friendliness to the character at least at first which then fades away once we realize the truth about him. Beyond being a character trait of Norman Bates this is a recognized character trait of ALL PSYCHOPATHS!!!!<br /><br />There are a few good aspects of this film. Some of the performances are great. As I said Vince Vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been atrocious but unlike Janet Leigh who was untruthfully advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film Anne Heche was given last billing in the opening credits.<br /><br />I read on the cover of a copy of the Psycho novel that Gus Van Sant claimed this was not a remake of the Hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. I now wish that I had bought that book and saved the comment because after seeing this film that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen. There was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original and it would be far more believable if Van Sant had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet Zafroomulax. So many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why Hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way. Such as the scene in which Sam and Lila are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow. Hitchcock covered these actors faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances not because of any artistic or stylistic purpose.<br /><br />In other words my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it replicates something thats already been said. Like everyone else here I reccommend you dont waste your time on this film and get the original.',neg
'Zodiac Killer. 1 out of 10. Worst acting ever. No really worst acting ever. David Hess (Last House on the Left. No the one from the seventies. Rent it its really good) is the worst of the bunch (Pretty stiff competition but he is amazingly god-awful.) One would be hard pressed to find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence. The film actually screeches to a stunning painful halt when he is on the screen.<br /><br />Not that the film actually has any redeeming qualities for Mr. Hess to ruin. It is filmed with a home movie camera and by the looks of things a pretty old one complete with attached boom mike. No post production either. Come on there has to be some shovelware a five year old computer could use that could clean up this picture. Throw in bizarre stock footage pictures of autopsys and aircraft carrier takeoffs and this is one visually screwed up picture. The autopsy pictures are interjected the way Italian cannibal films interject those god-awful real life animal killings. And the Navy footage is supposed to be some anti war statement (Cause we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the Navy) What in the world is Lions Gate is doing releasing this garbage? It would embarrass Troma. The plot is about the Zodiac Killer (Last seen in Dirty Harry . No the one from the seventies. Rent it its really good) Somebody gets shot in the stomach in LA and the cops assume the Zodiac Killer is back? Uh-huh. What can you expect from a movie that doesnt know that DSM IV is a book not a psychiatric disorder and where the young killer older man relationship resembles that of a congressional page and closeted congressman? Yeah eighties haircuts and production values meet a Nambla subplot. Sign me up.',neg
'Philo Vance had many affinities with Bulldog Drummond He was a gentleman with the kind of polish and elegance only usually associated with the British upper classes and he was also independently wealthy<br /><br />But there were vital differences Drummond was an adventurer charming gallant lively Vance could be pompous slight1y dull and self-righteous There was a hint of fundamental cruelty in his manner<br /><br />The Kennel Murder Case is the most impressive of the 14 Vance films made between 1929 and 1947 The story of a murdered collector of Chinoiserie it has all the ingredients of the classic private eye mystery  exotic setting in the blue nose Long Island Kennel Club three killings for Vance to solve including a baffling locked room murder the key to the whole affair and plenty of suspects <br /><br />Usually a detective story setting have proved too static and talkative to make convincing movies even though they work well enough on the printed page but here Michael Curtizs direction and the fine editing give the film a pace and urgency that make it altogether different from similar films of its type <br /><br />William Powells elegance and suavity made him the perfect Vance and although a year later he switched studios he stayed in the same genre with the enormously successful and popular The Thin Man at MGM',pos
'If you hit your head with a shovel write the script with your feet you may come close to the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this movie that hasnt been done a thousand times in other gangster flicks and done much better. Those who think Scarface was some kind of hero to be looked up to or saw Goodfellas Menace II Society or Dead Presidents and thought MMM Thats the life for me! will like this movie. I thought Id give the movie a chance since the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs were involved. Anyone above a 4th grade education see the original with Pacino a real actor and be satisfied.',neg
'Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called Good. We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship. This however should not take away credit that is due to Konkana and Shabana Azmi for relating so well with the characters!',pos
'I was really surprised with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer Id seen I thought it was going to be a Dude Wheres My Car kind of crap fest. I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because thats just how movies work. Instead I got a smart surprisingly original movie about a decent average guy who just never had sex.<br /><br />Yes the film is chock full o sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple! but its done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.<br /><br />I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap and I was very surprised. Yea its pretty over the top (cmon its a movie about a 40 year old virgin!) but its very smartly done.<br /><br />In the end youre really pulling for this guy to get laid which says a lot about the movie because honestly did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?',pos
'This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe. Gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation while Gordon is traveling back and forth to New York. He manages however to leave behind some clues scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Columbo enters the case suspects her at once and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. Oh and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordons secretary and would-be blackmailer. Hartley is I believe the grand daughter of the psychologist B. F. Skinner. Im not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button which is on display during a belly dance sequence but Ive always admired Skinner anyway.<br /><br />The murder is well handled. Its a good plot and none of the performers or crew fluff anything. But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon only a skosh over five feet tall. She was over 80 years old and looked it. There are moments when she almost teeters but she consistently exudes charm. Her acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when shes being serious or when shes putting Columbo and the audience on. Shes given some good lines too. What humor there is comes from Gordon. Columbo doesnt have any of his frequent comic moments.<br /><br />All in all a nice job by everyone concerned.',pos
'this movie I saw some 10 years ago (maybe more) I took it in a rental and never found it to buy even in French sites. The end is very surprising and intelligent.

'I just got the DVD for Hardware Wars in a shiny new package looking irresistable. Stuck it in my DVD player to find a slew of extra fun stuff. The extra content on the DVD is even longer than the movie. For those of you that have (shame!) never seen Hardware Wars it one fantastically silly Star Wars spoof (of Episode IV of course). Household appliances (such as irons toasters vacuums and a waffle maker) stand in for Ty-fighters X-wings R2D2 and the death star. Instead of Princess Leia we have Princess Ann-Droid complete with Cinnabon hairdo. You get the point Im sure. Mad silliness and a fun ride for any Star Wars geek (like me!)<br /><br />Now the DVD - wow! A directors commentary where he basically goes off on the movie making fun of himself and the project throughout. An interview with Fosselius on Creature Features (remember that?!) and hilarious directors cut and foreign version of the movie (all jokes of course). Anyway this is great. I loved Hardware Wars in the theater and am so glad for having the DVD in my collection - wedged in between MST3K: the movie and Thumb Wars!',pos
'I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few parts were slow but it was only setting the mood and building up to the action. I thought this movie was very educational it taught me more about my Croatian heritage. I also learned more about Louise Arbour and I can say she has a very great influence on me. Time magazine named Louise Arbour one of the worlds 100 most influential people in April of 2004. I recommend this movie to people that like historical movies (obviously). This movie was very dramatic but still told the truth of events in the former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbour is a brave hero and Im glad they made a movie honouring her. If you see the movie I hope youll like it.',pos
'Though the title includes the word zombies this film is not what youd expect from a movie made today though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected. Dean Jagger portrays Armand Louque an officer in the French Army of World War I who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons or zombies who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war though on whose side is not certain. At first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon but eventually French General Duval (George Cleveland) orders a non military expedition into the ancient Cambodian city of Angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it.<br /><br />The story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving Louque Duvals daughter Claire (Dorothy Stone) and Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland) all a part of the expedition. When Louque laments over his lack of forcefulness and resolve Grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power. That advice begins to transform Louque particularly after hes successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city. Having followed a temple priest into a swamp Louque now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking though its not made clear how he has instantaneously been able to command the power of zombiefication. All it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control. This comes in handy for winning back his girl and taking Graysons early advice as he comments to his servant Buna were learning to be ruthless.<br /><br />Fans of early B horror flicks will recognize the use of Bela Lugosis signature eye stare plucked from the 1932 film White Zombie also from director Victor Halperin. Of the two movies White Zombie is preferably superior both in story content and in its depiction of the undead where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening. In Revolt the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentors commands. In fact the actual revolt of the title occurs only when Louque releases the soldiers from his mental command in deference to his love for Claire; they overrun his compound and kill him in the process.<br /><br />Not to be too harsh on the film it plays out decently within the parameters of its story outline but if youre thinking zombies!!! within the traditional context youll probably be disappointed. If you want to sample an early treatment of the subject the aforementioned White Zombie with Bela Lugosi is the way to go.',neg

'***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)<br /><br />Do you believe there is a part of yourself deep inside in your mind with things you dont want other people to see? During a session when Im inside I get to see those things.<br /><br />--Catherine Deane<br /><br />And so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year The Cell is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it. I can understand the reasons some people dislike this production. With a story that combines disturbing serial killers with mind-probing The Cell is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think its one of the years most engrossing films.<br /><br />Making his feature film screenwriting debut Mark Protosevich creates an imaginative world of rich colorful images and provocative characters. The filmmakers take advantage of every shot. Protosevich conceived ideas for The Cell in 1993 when he decided to combine two of his major interests mind-probing and serial killers. He was reportedly influenced by such directors as Wes Craven George Romero and David Cronenberg. They would probably be proud of such an imagination.<br /><br />The film combines two major narratives one about scientific exploration of the human mind and the other about a psychopath who murders young women for his own sexual pleasure. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) a child therapist is part of a neurological study at the Campbell Center a research clinic. Because of her empathetic personality scientists chose Deane to enter the mind of a catatonic preteen in hopes to revive his brain into waking.<br /><br />A sick demented serial killer roams the streets. Within an abandoned rural farmhouse Stargher (Vincent DOnofrio) locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes from the FBI every time they draw near until now. A violent seizure renders him comatose. The FBI captures his forever unconscious body. Unfortunately he already prepared the cell with his latest victim. In forty hours the cell will fill with water and Stargher is the only man who knows the location of his victim.<br /><br />The FBI takes this situation to Campbell Center where Catherine enters the mind of Stargher hoping to discover the location of his latest victim before the cell fills with water sending the woman to a watery grave.<br /><br />The science fiction portions of the story relied on both real science and theoretical fiction in the creation of the Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System. The premise takes a long time to develop but it is worth the wait. It is far fetched but that doesnt matter. The film makes us believe. Even if you dont suspend disbelief however the visual enticement provides an engaging setting to enjoy.<br /><br />According to the films production notes Mark Protosevich was thrilled to work with the director named Tarsem because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail stunning art direction and highly developed abilities to tell a story. When I wrote The Cell explains Protosevich I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of painters paintings or photographs while I was working. So Im thinking visually and Tarsem is a highly visual director. Tarsem has a similar frame of visual references which made for a very smooth collaboration.<br /><br />Vincent DOnofrio provides the film with a backbone and no actor could have accomplished his character any better. He delivers a mysterious disturbing and engaging performance. I think that my character is in a way trapped in himself DOnofrio ponders. He also researched the psychology of serial killers to help get him beneath the surface of the character. His in-depth performance preparation pays off beautifully.<br /><br />While the actors writer and director do wonders with their material the real honor goes to the films behind-the-scenes talent. The director of photography Paul Laufer production designer Tom Foden costume designer April Napier special effects coordinator Clay Pinney and visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug. They bring the world of The Cell to life. Its is an extraordinary world worthy of several viewings. Some movies you watch others you experience. The Cell falls into the later category.<br /><br />',pos
'I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesnt understand action films or recognize a good one. Perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black ( Lethal Weapon/ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across. Over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I have ever seen in any film. The cast in this film crackles. Genna Davis gave a tremendous performance and its a damn shame there was never a LKG sequel. Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as her sidekick Mitch a down on his luck private eye trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks. If Baffles me how anyone could not like this film. It packs so many thrills and its so funny. The wisecracks in this film still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later. In my mind the first Matrix film and the Long Kiss Goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action flicks of the 90s. Incidentally Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script. At the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny. Its so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance cause they would have witnessed Renny Harlins best film and Genna Davis like you have never seen her before. Long live The Long Kiss Goodnight!!',pos
'Definitely a must see for all fans of film noir.<br /><br />Thanks to a fine script and crisp razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller.<br /><br />Wonderful characterizations articulate the movies powerful message of racial and religious tolerance. Its difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isnt a weak link in the entire company but Robert Ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chilling.<br /><br />Making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage. Nowall these years later at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language bare breasts crummy acting and deafening soundtracks its refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like Crossfire.<br /><br />Another low budget gem from the Hollywood archives .',pos
'New York 1953. One hot night four famous iconic figures will come together. The professor (Albert Einstein) has come to NY to give a speech which he has the senator (Joesph MacCarthy) on his back. Later that night his gets a surprise visitor; a famous actress (Marilyn Monroe). Who actually wants to discuss the theories of Relativity. Soon her ball-playing husband (Joe DiMaggio) turns up at the hotel room begging to work things out for their crumbling relationship. Flashbacks of childhood important events perceived consequences of their actions creep in to show how these individuals cope with despair and a hidden fear waiting to break out.<br /><br />Now thats one-of-a-kind! Adapted off a stage-play by Terry Johnson (who would also script the screenplay for the film) Insignificance is an odd quirky seductive and downright curious fictional pop-culture gimmick in the hands of director Nicolas Roeg. This inspired and cerebral experimental effort might be rooted in its stage-play origins because it does feel theatrical and most of the action occurs in a hotel backdrop and one main suite. The cramp look only enhanced the moody and smoky atmosphere of New York to great effect. However these limitations cant contain the fruitful and daring ideas that Roeg manages to randomly storm up visually and through the meaningful material. The way he reflects on the characters (who are suggestively famous figures without the need of naming of them) philosophical journeys and interpretations of their notions is stimulating in a spiritual sense with the memories gelling into the present and visions showing their fears of realisations which depending on what youre seeing is either beautiful or hauntingly implemented. Theres plenty of food for thought and hints within the verbosely innovative (if sometimes awkward) script with the main focus concerning the present situation but the flashbacks gives us the personal make-up (sex power enlightenment and glory) of what makes them who they are and how much of a burden it can be in there already demanding lives. Sure the story might not lead to anything by the end and it can feel disjointed but the dreamy vibe and intelligent arrangement irons out those folds and makes sure it never turns giddy. Peter Hannans sensually fluid photography and Stanley Myers titillatingly oozing blues soundtrack fit in snugly with Roegs stylistically subdue and established style of directing. He makes it look like hes working with something big and large-scale but otherwise thats not the case and a small little universe is created. The vintage costumes and locations of the period all come off fittingly enough. What made the film for me had to be the impressive acting it boasted from the main four. Theresa Russells perky drop dead gorgeous appeal of the sexy pin-up actress is a growing portrayal that definitely held the film together along with an genuinely excellent and endearing performance by Michael Emil as the professor. Tony Curtis marvellously plays it up as witch-hunting senator and Gary Busey is suitably good in the stoically gravel manner as the ballplayer. Showing up in minor but amusing support roles happen to be Will Sampson and Patrick Kilpatrick.<br /><br />A memorably striking fresh and tour de force meditation piece of metaphysics linked together by four different extremes. Some might find it pretentiously estrange and too talky but this one had me wrapped up in its own little unique world to worry too much about its shortcomings.',pos
'I am sorry but this is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. I cannot believe that after making the first one in the series they were able to get a budget to make another. Not that the budget could have been much - this is the least scary film I have ever watched and laughed all the way through to the end (actually I cant believe we watched it to the end) but I think it is because we couldnt quite believe it.',neg
'I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppolas masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981 as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is without a doubt a must see a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. Charlie Dont Surf. Robert Duvalls famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition. It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.',pos
'Even by the standards of most B-movies this movie is by far the worst Ive ever seen. The graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. the ocean water effects are especially laughable including the one scene where they board the mini-sub and the water looks like its frozen in place. The problems with this film are so numerous that Ill just stop here with the details. needless to say I kid you not when I say that even Uwe Toilet Boll himself could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all cost there are other B grade movies out there that despite being horrible are at least a good way of passing the time by.',neg
'Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It is just that bad. Truly an uneven and unfair portrayal of bad vs. good in the wine world. Did you notice the filmmaker trying any of the wines from the featured protectors of individual wines and terroir. The camera work is dizzying at best while the content may put you to sleep before long. This is not insightful journalism. What I got from this movie was that the filmmaker was trying hard to make a point about the globalism of wine by showing for example that the Mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world. Okay that is a good start. So how do these wines compare? Does the Mondavi Napa cab taste like their Italian wines. We never find out because no one in the film comments on this. Instead there is a lot of innuendo about Nazis and fascism. Well those things dont grow grapes. Hmmmm.',neg
'This is the award that made me lose all respects for the Hugos.<br /><br />If such a distinguished panel cant see or care about the obvious story-telling problems of Battlestar Galactica then what worth is their award? The answer: not much.<br /><br />Award-winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence neither of which are in evidence in BG in this episode or any other that Ive seen.<br /><br />Shooting in drab video is not artistic its just cheap. Shaking the camera is not creative its vomit-inducing and lazy as can be.<br /><br />All BG has shown is how corrupt most award-giving academies really are and how easy it is to buy awards with a lot of PR money.',neg
'Pure schlock from beginning to end. The average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination. Otherwise its a pure camp-fest endurance test. Like one of those so-so episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation that thinks it has Something Important To Say.<br /><br />Youll see every plot twist a mile off in this by-the-numbers romp. However its worth seeing for its portrayal of drag-king prostitutes a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them (hows that for role reversal) and lesbian soap operas. The ghost of Valerie Solanis lives!',neg
'So Udo Kier earned like nine bucks and free food for this so that is a victory in and of itself. <br /><br />More importantly this movie tells a very interesting tale about a group of salvage guys coming across the broken down Demeter. I should warn you im gunna bounce around through this review real quick so buckle up. First things first. Coolio plays a guy named 187. 187 likes drugs. 187 finds a bunch of caskets on board and... now i dont know anything about the future but maybe they smuggle drugs in caskets. Not gunna say that was the craziest thing in this movie. Later on the vampire gets out of his mist filled coffin and then the real hilarity begins. First although this movie has the word Dracula in it he is actually not in this movie. I have a theory though. Out of the blue you see the salvage crews ship leave without them. My theory is that Dracula was on board with his retarded brother Orlock. Dracula told Orlock hell be right back. Dracula got the hell out of this movie before he could be seen leaving Orlock to play the vampire for the six or so minutes he is in the movie. The best part of this film and for those of you that have seen this you know what im gunna say is after 187 gets sired embraced whatever. He has this huge monologue about ejaculating on various parts of erika Elaniaks body and... other super cool stuff. Coolio seriously you are the best thing EVER. <br /><br />Some other stuff happens in this movie too. Like Casper Van Dean gets some work. Orlock screams a lot and loses his arm and then we kinda lose track of him FOR THE REST OF THE MOVIE. And thank god really. We find out Erikas character is a police bot. As the movie comes to a close we find out that the ship is on a course to ram into the sun. The police bot and one other surviving character are doomed. Rather then avoid certain death Erikas police bot reveals shes also a whore bot and they decide to screw each other and die. Before they die in the sun they die for no reason yep thats right... their ship blows up for no real reason. <br /><br />This movie got the amazing rating for one reason Coolio. My god if they gave academy awards to black rappers then hed be the first to get one. The only reason this didnt get a perfect ten is because there was not a drop of nudity. Now i know what your thinking how can you judge a film by whether ladies show their goods or not. Well easy. A movie like this pretty much requires it. Its part of the process. Gore gore monsters nudity gore end of movie final shock at the end. Its the formula. This had some gore the monster was awesome because he sucked so hard he actually did us the favor of staying off camera. That was considerate of him and i respect that. Nudity not a drop even though there was a length conversation about... well see the above statement and as for the shock/twist... i certainly didnt see the end coming. That counts. <br /><br />I hope Hollywood doesnt think Coolio gave this film his all and has nothing left. He deserves more work. Well until Dracula 4000 im out.',pos
'A question for you : A family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces . Which film am I talking about ? Every horror film you`ve seen ? Yes that`s true but that`s not the answer I`m looking for . I`ll narrow it down by saying there`s a lot of teen angst scenes . Doesn`t help ? Well there`s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s POV . No futher forward ? Okay there`s a dream sequence involving lots of blood ? Could still be any horror film you say . Oh gawd this could take weeks so I`ll say the film I`m talking about features loads of Aussies many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY . Yes that`s right the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE ( aka CUBBYHOUSE ) and do you understand what the above exercise is about ? It`s about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any horror film that`s been made',neg
'Plunkett & Macleane falls into my favourite genre of film (historical action adventure with comedy) which is probably why I rate it so highly.<br /><br />The action centres around a highwayman (Plunkett) and a layabout gentleman who gets entangled with him and his schemes (Macleane). This leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures which are all tinged with comedy. There is also of course a love interest.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the wealthy at this time.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment.',pos
'Following the movie that represents the pinnacle of the 1980s Ninja genre namely The Revenge Of The Ninja salivating fans were treated to this bizarre offering that mixes Ninja shenanigans with spiritual possession....the end result being not dissimilar in nature to that somewhat horrifying experience when one spies a nugget of human poop floating menacingly towards oneself in a public swimming pool.<br /><br />Take for instance the supposed action packed introduction which is set of all places on a golf course(!) Here we witness an evil green clad ninja slaying a group of golfers for apparently no discernible reason whatsoever (although I must admit that the shallow elitist attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport does irk me somewhat though...hmmmm perhaps THATS why he murdered them?.....yep I can relate to that after all). Actually later in the movie we are told that one of the golfers was a top scientist but this story line is never elaborated upon nor alluded to ever again!!!<br /><br />Anyway back to the intro the police proceed to surround the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell out of the assassin....and they have to keep on shooting him because he just wont stay down!!! Yes literally hundreds of rounds are pumped into him and STILL he gets up to slay evermore of the law enforcement numbers.<br /><br />Finally (after what seems like an eternity) our miscreant detonates a smoke bomb and disappears.....or so it seems for in actual fact he is merely hiding beneath the soil and upon our decidedly gormless officers leaving the scene to search for his body he crawls out from hiding and staggers away.<br /><br />We next see the lovely Lucinda Dickey a truly beautiful actress and in superbly fit physical condition here playing a telephone repair worker. From her high vantage point she happens to spot the dying (AT LAST!!!!!) ninja. However upon closer investigation the man supposedly on his last legs suddenly leaps upon her and grapples her to the ground. After a bit of a struggle our feisty heroine manages to break free luckily but doesnt count on the ninja possessing hypnotic powers and she inevitably succumbs to them. It is at this point that the dying ninja actually projects his soul into our heroine! His intention is to use her corporeal form to slay those officers who killed him (the few he didnt actually manage to wipe out initially!)<br /><br />From this point on throughout the film whenever our heroine spots one of the aforementioned officers she is subjected to some overwhelmingly awful cinematic scenes of flashing lights smoke effects and the sword that the ninja bequeathed unto her levitating towards her in a most wobbly manner!<br /><br />To make matters more complex a particularly irritating police officer (who sports enough back and shoulder hair to put an average yak to shame!) persists in trying to win her affections (in a most bloody annoying manner!!!)......well of course it doesnt take the gift of preconception to work out that in a rather feeble shock (less) twist towards the end of the film HE is revealed to be one of the officers she must slay!<br /><br />But wait theres some hope yet! <br /><br />Step forward the one and only Sho Kosugi!<br /><br />Yes THE ninja himself and looking here as cool as ever! Golf club news obviously travels fast and upon learning of the said events that transpired there he flies all the way from Japan to sort the situation out (suspecting the worst!) In a brief sub story (that amounts to all of a few seconds!) Shos interest in this particular ninja is demonstrated to be personal after the said villain is shown to have murdered Shos father/teacher(?) and blinded one of Shos eyes (thus necessitating Sho to wear a really decorative looking sword guard eye patch!)<br /><br />After stealing his dead nemesiss body from the morgue and then tracking down our heroine who provides an unwitting abode for the evil soul matters climax at an oriental temple (seemingly in the middle of nowhere) where our man Sho manages to reunite the two disjointed aspects.<br /><br />Now reanimated from the dead the evil ninja and Sho battle it out in traditional ninja style with swords with the winner being........well yes you can probably guess.<br /><br />Really this movie has only two things going for it namely the always excellent Kosugi (who looks absolutely fantastic in the role as always) and the lovely Miss Dickey. What a shame that the material they found themselves in here is such a rancid pile of ordure.<br /><br />Oh well to be fair Ive seen a lot worse than this in my time although I certainly still cant recommend this other than to those desperate to complete their Sho Kosugi/Ninja movie collections.',neg
'This movie isnt worth the film it was photographed on. The dialog is flat filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time. The choppy shaky film style is a cheap imitation of the The Ring style visual effects. The characters do not even act like a normal person would. For example the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesnt even once call out her sisters name to see if she is home. What? You would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her. Way too many flashbacks to her childhood. Too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director. It is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street up the driveway around this corner over here over there oh a side view now a front view. Enough already. You would think you are watching a TV commercial for the Solaris! Terrible movie. 0 out of 100. I really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it.',neg
'I own this movie on DVD and I have watched it about 10 times and its still funny. The jokes will never get boring and I often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about them. The premise is that Richard and Eddie of Bottom fame own the cheapest hotel in Britain next to a nuclear power plant. They are desperately in need of cash and when a film star in hiding comes to stay their luck just might be in.<br /><br />To watch this movie and not become utterly bored or disgusted you first need to like the humour. Some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it. But overall its a great movie.',pos
'This is a well-made documentary on the exciting world of Indy Car racing. The photography is simply outstanding. The scene were Mario Andretti drives the old racing roadster down the New England street lined with the ancient maples leaves blown to the side by the speed of the car is incredible.

'A gave it a 2 instead of a 1 (awful) because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork. But that wasnt enough to save it.<br /><br />The sepia toned washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies. Nothing new there. I can see there were some hat-tips to other old classic movies. OK. No problem with that.<br /><br />But a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting not something that would put you to sleep.<br /><br />The story line and the script of this movie WAS awful the characters two dimensional. Slow moving. Some of the scenes were pretty to look at but ultimately as a whole it was quite boring I couldnt recommend it.',neg
'End Game started well the least said about the end the better. it seemed like things were happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no reason for this apart from the next scene wouldnt make sense without it. The whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes it would have made an average TV political drama The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable however and James Woods does an admirable job considering.<br /><br />The end game was honestly one of the worst films Ive ever seen......and thats saying something Ive seen Gigli.',neg
'Too much added with too much taken away from a great western that was written by McMurtry about the Texas Rangers vs. the Indian. This screenplay takes that away only to fill this mini series with a lot of warm fuzzy relationships that in truth were secondary to the main storyline. It ends with a totally unbelievable and detached ending not written in the book that makes you question how we are to be transported to Lonesome Dove.<br /><br />The series main characters were in truth cast very well the filming locations were excellent but this mini series should have stayed true to what is a great book.',pos
'This is the biggest load of crap that I have seen in a long time. The last time I hated a movie so much was whilst watching 28 Days later and Magnolia. There is absolutely no point to this movie except to see some really sick and twisted sex/rape scenes Gillian Anderson relieving herself on the side of the road and every single sentence of dialog having to use the F word at least a couple of times in it. It has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget. My friend and I eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour. We had tried to give it a chance but nothing could save this crud. DO NOT WATCH IT!!!',neg
'This movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved. Its always interesting to see the story from the other side for a change. This movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad Russia where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being fought.<br /><br />Its interesting to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the Germans simply as the villains. In this movie those villains are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who youre fighting against. At first its kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the Germans are the evil villains. But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care -and be interested in them.<br /><br />The way this story is told isnt however the best. Its hard to keep track of the story at times as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other. The movie isnt always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague. It also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who. It doesnt always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around. In that regard Hollywood movies are always better than European movies.<br /><br />The production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations though the movie wasnt even shot in Russia itself. It helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere.<br /><br />The character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic. But I dont know for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism. It also helps that theyre being played by well cast actors. All of the actors arent the best known actors around (Thomas Kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor) but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality.<br /><br />All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth a look due to its original approach of the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production values.<br /><br />7/10',pos
'You know I was very surprised when watching this movie. It aired during the day once when i was sick and having nothing else to do I continued watching. This is by far the WORST MOVIE EVER! But to my surprise I kept watching. I sat there saying this is terrible but yet didnt change the channel because I was so amused at how bad it was. Maybe It was the guy that looked like Big tom from survivor or the dreadful moustaches and mohawks these characters had that kept me watching. However the girls werent half bad but if thats what you want there is far better. Oh and theres NINJAS and PAJAMA BOYS!<br /><br />So if you like ninjas bad acting hilarious(and terrible) dialogue and two twins who are five feet tall and killing everything in their sight then this movie is for you. Its so bad its good. However I just had to give it a 1 out of ten. I couldnt have put a 10 on it up there with Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!!!!!! :)',neg
'I never saw any of John Leguizamos stand-up before I watched Freak and after seeing it again on HBO comedy recently it was better more enlivening and with things that at the age of 14 I couldnt understand quite before. Spike Lee did a wonderful job directing keeping the visual angle up to par with Leguizamos theatrics and the style of personal storytelling; its substance and style merging together but unobtrusively. We get Leguizamos rants about race and sex (the bits about sex are classic) but a lot of it is about family and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father. Even when things get dark in some of the stories theres something fresh or crazy or random that Leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh and it works more often than not. If something does fall flat (for me at any rate) it might be his personality tics here and there. But overall its the kind of fun material that isnt heady but is so true to itself that it stings. Find it if you can!',pos
'What seemed as a good premise for a movie...unfortunately it fails to deliver on nearly every level. Very hard to follow at the start of the movie I actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many arty splicings and semi-subliminal cuts throughout the movie that actually distracts you from the from the overall story. It really tries too hard to immerse you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it.',neg
'This is the best film version of Dickens classic tale. Ive seen it over and over on VHS and recently acquired the DVD version which is formatted for TV (not wide-screen). What I find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of English actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films/shows in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward the Equalizer as the Ghost of Christmas Present.',pos
'Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland you have to love My Left Foot (and especially Daniel Day-Lewis performance in it). He plays cerebral palsy-afflicted Christy Brown. Due to this he has spent most of his life ostracized. Even when trying to warn people about something they just laugh at him. The light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part: his left foot. He uses that appendage to paint and write poetry bringing him to prominence.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well on this collaboration and also on a later collaboration: In the Name of the Father (but The Boxer was unnecessary). My Left Foot can make you feel many ways: sad hopeful or something else. But in any case Daniel Day-Lewis gave the performance of a lifetime here. A great movie in every sense.',pos
'I had the opportunity to see this film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival in which it won an award for Best Picture. This film is brilliantly done with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble. My favorite performances were from Youssef Kerkour Justin Lane  and Adam Jones. Also there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches that I was surprised to find out that this film was done on a small budget. The writer-director Adam Jones who I believe also won an award for his writing does an excellent job with direction. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie. Definitely a must see.',pos

'I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I have enjoyed it every time. Sure the graphics are a little cheesy compared to now but back in the 70s it was great. I saw it in the original Spanish version only and thought it was wonderful. That was how I remember my Christmases were with my family - magical. Santa Claus was amazing and I couldnt wait for him to come back each year.<br /><br />If you have a child/children and speak Spanish bring them up watching this old fashioned version of Santa Claus. Its a different version than we are used to today but who says there is one way?<br /><br />Its a fun movie to watch. It teaches children good vs. bad. I dont know how the English subtitled version is or if there is an English one of this but the Spanish is the best. Enjoy and Happy Holidays! Feliz Navidad!',pos
'I first saw this movie about 3 years ago. I was shocked at how stupid the FBI was not to prevent such a tragedy. It could have been easily prevented. This movie was just unbelievable.<br /><br />Now seeing it after September 11th I am appalled and can say that this could have been prevented more easily that most people would want to know.<br /><br />This film is 100\% true<br /><br />In the final scene of the film when the mastermind of the 1st attack is being taken to prison by helicopter and flies over the towers he makes a spine chilling remark that was laughed at when he said it. Next time well bring them *BOTH* down. This was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest.<br /><br />This movie reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were carried out right under the noses of the FBI and NYPD. It shows how the 1st and 4th Amendments are partially to blame for the attacks.<br /><br />I watch this movie now and know that both attacks could have been prevented.',pos

This was a sub-par movie with a horrible hook and I would like a written apology from the studio that produced this along with some cookies to help repay me for the time I wasted on this crap fest that I can never get back. If you payed to see this movie I am truly sorry because I watched it on TV on a Sunday afternoon when I had nothing better to do and it pretty much ruined my whole week. A flying freaking WAGON?!?!

No wonder they dont have enough sense to tell someone he is beating them their mother teaches them nothing but that what she wants comes before everything else. Absolutely horrible.',neg
'Times are tough for Angel Town gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown (Mainly due to embarrassing writing) the gangs want a street kid Martine to join the gangs so they beat him up everyday. However due to the presence of an Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier Worlds lamest actor Gruner) named Jacques hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made (And Ive seen my share) it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need are French kick-boxers who cant act. Worst of all there are so many awkward moments its just truly hilarious. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit: You like the fighting? (Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock) I could kill him right? When I want him dead he dies! The reason why I dont want him dead is because im afraid of him and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me thats why he doesnt die! <br /><br />Of course the fact that its wrong to kill someone let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation. Odd.<br /><br />However dont let me make this sound that I hated this movie far from it its so terrible its priceless. The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gang-members who (the films biggest logic gap)decline the use of pistols. Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs while Gruner kick-boxes the rest. All of this set to the sound of horrible Mexican accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this.<br /><br />The other treat about this movie is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite thats the main reason hes here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend (In a graveyard in the films awkward beginning) Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand make sure to down tequila like the laughable opening song details Aint no mercy in Angel Town <br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)',neg

'I havent seen BSG I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldnt get into it. However I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday I felt a little lost so I decided to watch the Pilot today and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now I want to watch BSG as well.<br /><br />But what I really liked is that I didnt have to be a hardcore BSG fan to understand whats going on in Caprica. From what I have read in the net they were trying to reach the female population since BSG reached way more men and at least in my case it worked.<br /><br />However I suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do it from the beginning starting with the Pilot.',pos
'When I read MOST of the other comments I felt they were way too glowing for this movie. I found it had completely lost the spark found in the earlier Zatoichi movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen its often best to just let things be. I completely agreed with the Star Trek analogy from another reviewer who compared the FIRST Star Trek movie to the original series---millions of excited fans were waiting and waiting and waiting for the return of the show and were forced to watch a bland and sterile approximation of the original.<br /><br />The plot is at times incomprehensible it is terribly gory (though the recent NEW Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is much bloodier) and lacks the heart of the originals. I didnt mind the blood at all but some may be turned off by it (particularly the scenes with the severed nose and the severed heads). In addition time has not been good to Ichi--he seems a broken and sad man in this film (much much more than usual)--and thats something fans of the series may not really want to see.<br /><br />This was a very sorry return for Zatoichi. Unless you are like me and want to see EVERY Zatoichi film this one is very skipable. See one of the earlier versions or the 2003 ALL-NEW version.',neg
'Arthur is middle aged rich kid who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind. He likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he dont know and finds everything funny. Arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really weird).<br /><br />This is a damn funny film. I watched this film because a very famous Indian film Sharabee is based on the character of Arthur. Although Sharabee is definitely inspired by Arthur I think they are two different films. Arthur is just fun. Its very corny at times. There are so many fantastic one liners in the film. Its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fiancés father and he keeps talking about the moose. Duddley Moore sure has some comic timing. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a small country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud got an Oscar for this film. I dont know that actor. I dont think he did a great job but may be if I watched more of his work I may agree in future. Movie has some flat patches but not very long ones. looking forward to watch the sequel.',pos
'I have no idea what the budget on this movie was but whatever it was they made it work! I have seen movies that spend 100x the amount (Pearl Harbor anyone?) and sucked 200x worse. This movie has everything. David Makin It Naughton in the lead role as Adam an average college student who gets wrapped up in a game called the Great AllNighter run by Leon! This guy rocks! A genius with nothing better to do than come up with an elaborate game for a bunch of people to play. But he doesnt just pick his friends. He has a team of Jocks nerds fatties average kids and of course Flounders team who are the bad guys. But this movie has no black and white. There are many shades of gray. Adam is not the altruistic hero with no faults. He treats Alex P. like crap. AND Flounder is the way he is because of pressures from his Dad and a cranky stomach. The jocks play dirty but so does everyone else! This movie rocks! The scene at the PBR factory? Classic! Johnnys Obese Male Child? Can you write a better clue? This stuff is gold Jerry! GOLD! Maybe I am from a different generation but I love movies that seem far-fetched but still have roots in reality. This never happened...but it could. Eeeee-Gypt.... EEEE....Easter Bunny....Easter Parade! Oh and watch for a young Paul Rubens still working on that Pee wee character. PS That Devra Clinger WAS/is HOT! She must have been one bad actress not to work in Hollywood anymore. SEE THIS MOVIE!',pos
'Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. IM A CYBORG BUT THATS OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between. Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN DELICATESSEN) Park embarks on a fanciful lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision it is genuinely unexpected then to see all Parks effort add up to so very little.<br /><br />IM A CYBORG BUT THATS OK seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast but try as i might i could not bring myself to care for any.<br /><br />SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep indicating perhaps that Park was overindulging himself a little bit but it still managed to showcase some of the directors unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography was readily forgiven. None of the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here. IM A CYBORG BUT THATS OK left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave LADY a 5/10 and by that measure this probably deserves no more than a 3. For old times sake ill be generous: 4/10',neg
'I expected this to be a lot better. I love Tim Burtons work so I was really excited to see these online short films. Well they werent at all what I had expected.<br /><br />I dont really know what exactly it is I dont like. I guess theyre just sort of dull. The sound bothers me and most of the characters although I loved Roy the Toxic Boy and Stainboy.<br /><br />The Match Girl episode probably bugged me the most although it was pretty funny.<br /><br />I also dont like the way some of the characters die. Like how Match Girl basically set the gas station on fire or how the Girl Who Stares died in general. Roys death was amusing surprisingly. Death by a car freshener. Very original ;-) That made me laugh so hard...<br /><br />There are some things that arent appropriate for kids. Just some language and gore. Thats about all I have to say! 3/10',neg
'Again it seems totally illogical to me at least that Arthur merits a mere 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordons one-shot masterpiece herein is the totally unlikely if not quite impossible melding of wildly disparate elements. That he managed to make alcoholism laugh-friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is in itself wonderful. That he gave Dudley Moore his finest role and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact including the score seems to me patent and egregious. I challenge ANYone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud. But apparently nearly a third of its audience has so managed. Well I for one found and find Gordons effort both laughable AND lovable and the iikes of Geraldine Fitzgeralds great-aunt and Stephen Elliotts murderous would-be father-in-law absolute gems of background characters. Even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization and the late sniffish Sir John Gielgud was right about accepting his fee but wrong about undertaking his role. Arthur makes no effort to Underztand much less rationalize the scourge of alcoholism (hey iFit aint booze its other drugs of choice including meth and addictions are merely symptoms not targets) it simply observes in its own quizzical manner.',pos
'Anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will love<br /><br />this film. Taken from Ronald Taking Sides Harwood its a funny<br /><br />and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two<br /><br />very actorly types. Albert Finney is sublime as the despotic<br /><br />Shakespearean actor who barely notices the world war raging<br /><br />around him so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatre<br /><br />company and his own psychological and emotional breakdown.<br /><br />Tom Courtenay is matchless as Norman the Dresser of the title<br /><br />whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless.<br /><br />Really a must see.',pos
'Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who searches for her lost sister. Turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of Borneo. With Vietnam veteran Mark at her side she sets off to find her sister.<br /><br />As per usual the acting isnt of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl Me Me Lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare female lead Janet Agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things. Now thats gotta count for something! <br /><br />But I must say that I find it bit hard to recommend this title. If you are fan of the genre you will most likely recognize every gore scene in the movie bar a select few. And I mean that literally. A lot of the gore scenes are lifted straight out other Cannibal movies like MAN FROM DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. Theres probably more movies stuck in there.<br /><br />Ultimately this is one for die-hard fans to check off their list. If you havent seen any Italian jungle movies youd be better off watching CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and if youre an avid fan you have seen most of the gore scenes in other movies.',neg
'Where do we start with an offering like this? I nearly said film but that would be going a step too far. The only thing hellish about this film is that it is certainly a marriage made in hell between nothing and nonsense baloney and balderdash. These films should carry a physiological health warning so as not to damage ones spirit to the point where one might believe that all good film makers have left the planet and their resources have been handed to the dunderheads who have make this classic piece of trite garbage just like its sister in arms League of Extraordinary Twaddle. They are neither science fiction nor fact entertaining nor thought provoking humorous nor weighty but lay in a twilight zone devoid of any and all accoutrements that entice people to give up their valuable time sit in a darkened room and generally be more enlightened enlivened or happy at the end of it.

'Renee Zellweger is radiant but the rest of this movie just does not work. Its like a hamburger-jello-mold salad--interesting idea but who ever thought it would actually work on film? I like director LaButes two previous films--they were mercilessly honest and chillingly funny. This film manages only to be merciless and chilling--with jumbo dollops of the cutes. (As high concept think: the Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie Sam Peckinpah might have made--now reduce your expectations to match the present mass-produced state of Hollywood.) That actors as talented as Freeman Kinnear Eckhart Vince and Janney ALMOST make their scenes come alive is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that just does not cohere. I would have found Freemans corny feel-good-about-yourself speech at the end of the movie funny (in a Lynchean way) if it werent for the nagging suspicion that this unconvincingly tacked-on moral is meant to be accepted seriously.',neg
'I jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted remembering rahs and raves for it. But wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary it backed off and went somewhere else. The dripping water throughout the house the black rain the prophetic dreams taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream.<br /><br />What a disappointment. Chamberlains nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief something I found myself mirroring as the film wore on. What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into ones head. The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods that the Aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the Dream Time).<br /><br />[SPOILER] In the final scene it wasnt clear to me what the director was trying to tell. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? A tsunami? Yeah okay. Thats devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? Thatd have to be a pretty darn big wave. Why? Was the world that bad a place? It didnt seem so awful in this movie. Actually I didnt think the wave came off since the shadow left Burtons face that had been cast by the wave. Was it only Burtons apocalypse? Heck that happens every day to people who lose it. It wasnt of any interest if it was only him.<br /><br />The most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of Weirs potential was in Charlies apartment where Burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring Burtons wife. Charlie keeps asking him Who are you? and it becomes truly disturbing after a while. Unfortunately the movie never followed suit.',neg
'When I found out there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder I went through the roof!But I had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and I still have the bruise.First of all the character that Jeremy Irons (an actor I still admire even after this disappointment)plays was just awful. He treated his family like crap especially his sister played by Glenn Close. I could not get close or sympathize with any of the characters and Im no prude but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or they could have been toned down. Wynona and Antonios characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate. And what was with Meryls character and her mystical powers? Why didnt they go into this more? This film had a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of wasted talent here.',neg
'Ive no idea what dimwit from San Francisco came up with this stupid plot but apparently they need to get off whatever drugs they are taking and put their analyst on danger money -- NOW.<br /><br />Yeah this is a plausible story if you regard the alien abduction sequence in Life of Brian as plausible.<br /><br />This film is little more than a leftist pipedream. Had the US and USSR give up nuclear weapons the result wouldve been to eliminate the only real obstacle that kept the two from engaging in a war. Bad as Korea Vietnam and other wars of the era were they were proxy wars fought to keep the superpowers from a direct engagement.<br /><br />This film makes me think about how realistic it was when some group of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As if someone would say Mr. President some kids at Drastic High are not eating! and Ronald Reagan would reply My God! Id better revise my Defense policy! Right.<br /><br />Like this film? Wouldnt it be better if the Soviet Union wouldve collapsed because they could not support their massive arms build... wait that happened!',neg

Why was there so much sand that was put to so little use? Where was there so much table slapping? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy who he was shooting archery with? Did he realize the man was Japanese? Why was no no credible excuse given for Connerys accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent whether it be being raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact) being raised on the bayou in Louisiana (Universal Soldier) or having a French mother and being raised in Indochina (I cannot even remember the name of that movie)?

'Mark Hamill should have felt mighty embarrassed with CORVETTE SUMMER! This time he uses a new kind of force to regain the possession of his dream machine a bright red Vette. It looks like another sour teen-age flick the first half-hour and does a U-turn in heading for the wrong direction. The writing and directing jobs are dreadfully done with a few scenes you cant hardly take. Youre expecting this to happen anyway and youre also sniffing the smell of late-70s hodgepodge. Only a former newcomer like Annie Potts would easily steal the show and save this poor movie from the repo creeps! Her impractical but delightful personality holds on to your interest for good and this is the finest chance to see her in a swimsuit. Hooray for Annie! Sorry Mark!

'I was unlucky enough to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. Sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin. Being a devout fan of Lewis Carrolls Alice books I was very excited about this movies premier which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch. Normally Im enthusiastic about modern re-tellings if they are treated well. Usually its interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story. Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion. The adaptation of the originals characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying. It probably didnt help that the actors werent very good either. Most performances were ridiculously over the top which I assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script. I did not laugh once through out the duration of the film. All of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by. Really the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet Alice but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfmans work. Also Id have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance-off was awful. It was with out a doubt the low point of the film.<br /><br />What a joke. Dont see this movie. After its conclusion I was genuinely angry.',neg
'This has the absolute worst performance from Robert Duval who sounds just like William Buckley throughout the entire film. His hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest. Im not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but its the only thing I can recall from a truly forgettable film. This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do. Thank God Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent. He is a good character actor but thats about it. Klaus is so much better. His performance is muted and noteworthy.',neg
'I watched this movie based on the good reviews here and I wont make that mistake again.<br /><br />The first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy but you dont see what it is. Flashback 12-hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen. When the ending is finally reveled you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesnt happen and means nothing to what you have been watching. The only connection these people have is that they have all had a bad day--but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom.<br /><br />If this was supposed to be a Crash clone its a complete failure.',neg
'Completely agree with other review.<br /><br />I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasnt even a real sequel. This was after I slowly backed away from the TV with remote in hand jaw dropping lower and lower. <br /><br />The quality of the filming is beyond low budget. It doesnt even look like a freaking movie. If I were watching home video footage from a documentary I would expect it.<br /><br />In summary: Avoid avoid avoid. Boooo Lions Gate!<br /><br />Completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and I hope that Ive saved others from renting or owning it.',neg
'In A Woman Under the Influence Mabel goes crazy but I can see why she does go crazy. If I lived the kind of life she lived with the family she has I would go crazy too. Everyone in her family is off their rocker and not completely with it. She is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that arent the sharpest knifes in the drawer.<br /><br />To start with the one person closest to her in her life her husband Nick is a little off his rocker. He is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile. The rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he isnt there to support her when she needs support. The one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is he is just making her feel worse. She relies on him for support and always goes to him first when she feels she is acting wrong and he does nothing to support her. When she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act instead of comforting her he just yells at her and tells her what to do.<br /><br />The other major people in her life are her parents. Her parents do nothing in her life for her. Mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her. In the end she even asks her father to stand up for her and he doesnt understand and when he does get it he still does nothing. They do nothing to help Mabel recover or to keep her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period. The only person that tries to do something for her is Nicks mom. Nicks mom is adamant about having Mabel committed. She doesnt want to have Nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her. It seems as though everyone is against Mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they wont have to deal with it anymore. They all want to live their own lives and do nothing for Mabel except for yell at her and make her feel like she is doing something wrong when she really isnt. That is why she went crazy and why she had to be committed it was her familys entire fault.',neg
'Out of the 600 or so Spaghetti Westerns made this has got to be in the top twenty somewhere. Can not believe this hasnt received any reviews! Gemma is excellent in this. Van Johnson is good too though his dubbed voice is a little off killter but thats the charm of the Italian style. Beautiful photography and some excellently staged action. All the supporting characters are well played. The severity of the racist streak in the bad guys is pretty tough even by todays standards which creates an emotional depth to Gemmas character in some of the situations that take place. Absolutely FANTASTIC score by Luis Bacalov. See this is in the wonderful Wide screen DVD from Japan. A spaghetti must have.',pos
'The story is derived from King Lear; the setting is a farm in Iowa. Heres a test for this kind of thing: if you find yourself asking Why did so-and-so do such-and-such and the answer is because thats what happened in King Lear you know that the film has failed. Well that IS what happens here. The father figure in this story isnt living his own life hes mimicking a fictional one. But theres more wrong with the film than this.<br /><br />Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - far more ambitious than I think she realises. Shes trying to take the King Lear story and completely change the setting. This is a task in itself. The likeliest result is that the transplanted story will die and nobody will quite be able to work out why (although there are enough successful transplants like West Side Story to make it worth trying). But shes ALSO attempting a revisionist retelling. In the version of King Lear she wishes to create Reagan and Goneril command our sympathy and Cordelia is a villain. This is a task in itself too.<br /><br />Succeeding at either task is hard; succeeding at both at once is impossible. In fact succeeding at one while so much as attempting the other is impossible. If we are to look on the very same events from a different moral perspective then the events must BE the very same events - which means there can be no tampering with setting. If the story is to be transplanted alive into a different setting its moral heart must keep beating the whole while - which means there can be no tampering with ethical perspective. Moorhouse was bound to fail in not just one but in both of her endeavours. And so she did. ...Naturally its possible to attempt both tasks fail at both tasks yet by some fluke hit upon a work of art thats good for independent reasons. I mention this because I havent read Jane Smileys novel which for all I know IS good for independent reasons. But the film isnt. If there was nothing else wrong with it there would still be no getting around the fact that its just so thoroughly excruciatingly DULL. The very fields of corn are even more boring than they would be in real life - which neednt be the case since off the top of my head I can think of four films (The Wizard of Oz North by Northwest The Straight Story Kikujiro) in which the cornfields arent boring at all.',neg
'Watching Before The Devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema. I have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film - and for me the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience. It is one of those films that has stayed with me and I continue to ponder and think about it.<br /><br />Surely the DVD would illuminate some more of the themes and the film-making elements? Which include: Sidney Lumets comeback movie the time-shifting technique deployed in the storytelling the superb combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well the masterly direction the relatively rare focus Hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women the under-presented but nevertheless resonant Marisa Tomeis performance and of course the superb Hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the movie.<br /><br />Phew! Surely a masterful film. So imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated DVD - only to find no commentary no behind-the-scenes no interviews no extras.<br /><br />Hey - distributors - sort it out!',pos
'If I have to give this movie a score on a linear scale then I have to give it a low score 3/10.<br /><br />But it was entertaining and there are several good things to say about the movie.<br /><br />The psychiatrist candidate James Bishop is assigned to St. Andrews Hospital for his resident and is exited and eager to change the world.<br /><br />From the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth but James thinks he can make a difference and doesnt recognise this evil. <br /><br />The story builds fairly well you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil and wonder when and how James will discover this. Also when the break comes James is in a way hunted by the evil and you feel some suspense until the fight is over.<br /><br />Add an innocent beautiful girlfriend that arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements and you get the picture.<br /><br />The character buildup is actually fairly good you are introduced to most of the people that gets killed some of them you get to know.<br /><br />The film sets an unpleasant scene this is also done fairly well. There are mysteries that are unveiled - in an acceptable way.<br /><br />The main character James is very believable - the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting.<br /><br />What kills this movie is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of Plan 9 from outer space-type bad (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad acting (or probably very few takes when filming) - The main characters sometimes acts badly and somtimes good. * The sound is at times very cheap.<br /><br />I kept thinking I could make a movie like this with my home video camera throughout the film.',neg

Quirky and often surprising this is not the best of Bradys films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest) though it does have a unique charm.

You know from the start how its going to end but when it comes it is honest and very open ended a realistic and credible ending the end seemed like a beginning enjoyable and left me wanting more.',pos

Is it possible to write ten lines? The acting was horrific. It had absolutely no flow. I saw the made for TV movie on the BTK killer and it was much better(in comparison to this one). I am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer they missed by a mile.

'Do-It-Yourself indie horror auteur Todd Sheets returns with another entertainingly atrocious nickelndime shot-on-video clunker thats basically just a feeble excuse to sling around a lot of watery blood and gleaming guts as often as possible. An evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as ravenous rot-faced zombies so they can feast on the living. A bunch of bickering college kids a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by the vicious Slade (Byron Nichodemus hamming it up to an outrageous degree) two equally savage sleazeball hoodlums and a trio of hottie sisters all have to do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal. Thats it for the needlessly muddled and convoluted plot but fortunately what this hilariously horrendous hoot lacks in narrative coherence (plenty) it more than compensates for with a pleasing plethora of gloriously grossngraphic gore. Disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers chopped off a fatal gunshot to a young gals groin attempted necrophiliac rape evisceration and of course more repulsive entrail eating than you can shake a pile of moist intestines at. Moreover weve also got rough grainy cinematography that constantly alternates between washed-out color and grimy black and white ineptly staged fight scenes lousy acting from a uniformly pathetic no-name cast (Jerry Angell in particular cops the top crummy thespic dishonors for his laughably abysmal histrionics as slimy no-count psycho criminal Joe Bob) a grating head-banging thrash metal soundtrack and a generic shiverynominous synthesizer score. Lets not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble across a few vials of flesh-eating bacteria to use on the shambling undead hordes.

TROMA`S WAR is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you`ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? Of course not .

I lasted a very very very long forty minutes before giving up. Its just boring pretentious twaddle.<br /><br />The last French movie I saw was Romance and it too was pretty dismal but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time. I am baffled at the continuing popularity of Dogme 95 overseas -- itll catch on in America about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy.

'My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film but this is not true. I did enjoy the movie but was probably expecting too much.<br /><br />Adele who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon did not come off as a very likable character. She is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. This is the one thing she knows how to do without fail. Adeles daughter Anna is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mothers shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old. This of course makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna since she never seems to be 14- 17 years old either. Portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years. Yet even with the two solid leads Wayne Wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and even more so with Smoke. Though I have not read the book the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen changes which may drain the emotional pungency of the story. I enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work but I never got lost in the experience and I never related to their plight.',pos
'When I first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though I saw it again recently I have not changed my mind about it. I think it was Robert Ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real life(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse. Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.

'I thought Harvey Keitel a young fresh from the Sex Pistols John Lydon then as a bonus the music by Ennio Morricone. I expected an old-school edgy Italian cop thriller that was made in America. Istead I got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying: WTF!!! Too many unanswered questions and not enough action. The result: a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together so maybe Quentin Tarantino can reunite these guys with better script. Oh and the Morricone score: OK but not memorable.<br /><br />Overall not a waste of time but not a must see unless you are a hardcore Keitel fan.',neg
'Lost is the best TV series there is.First of allit has GREAT actors and wonderful directing.The writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary but after season 3 the writing became highly complex.For instancewho is Jacob?Why are there polar bears on the island?Whats the fog?How did the island disappear?Who is Richard Alpert?A lot of people think that the writers are lost and that they have raised a lot of questions and mysteries that they cant explain.I believe these people are wrong.I have confidence in the writers.I think that if the mysteries are revealed from now all the charm of the series will be gone.Anywaylost is undeniably the greatest TV series and it will continue to be for a long time.',pos
'After repeatedly saying how brilliant so many Columbo episodes are its time to honour an episode with maximum points. Etude In Black is not 100 percent perfect but its certainly more than 90 percent...maybe 96 or 97! <br /><br />Last week I reviewed Just Married and compared it unfavourably to Meet The Parents. Well heres one of the parents Blythe Danner in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor Alex Benedict played by the legend that is John Cassavetes. Alex has been having an affair with Jennifer Wells a girl in the orchestra (not his first affair one suspects). She is blackmailing Alex to leave his wife but as his wifes mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra Alex doesnt think itd be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight. Instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide.<br /><br />Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesnt take much longer for Columbo to connect Alex to the victim and soon hes following him around wherever he goes. Even though Columbo is certain Alex is his man it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads (none of which Columbo really swallows) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />Along the way there are some top-notch extra characters ranging from the precocious young neighbour of Jennifer Wells and the English mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on Coronation Street through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder (he had also been seeing Jennifer Wells the busy girl!). And theres even a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy films. As with Leslie Nielsen in Lady In Waiting its impossible to take him seriously (I bet youre thinking of that speech he made at the podium arent you?!) <br /><br />But its Blythe Danner John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells number from memory she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. Its a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very very wrong. Columbo doesnt help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alexs relations with members of his orchestra.<br /><br />As for John Cassavetes well its a shame he didnt make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this performance is superb! Hes another one who falls into the highly irritated category losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbos genius.<br /><br />Well its a really really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music as highlighted by many of the posters here but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally if you havent come across it there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. Im totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act playing circus music while Falk Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. Its clear to see from the quality of Etude In Black just how well the pair worked together!',pos
'This show has everything you could ever want from a prison drama. There are twists and turns all the way till the season finally. The characters are very strong and it gives the show a lot of power. When watching the show you feel for not only the prisoners but the prison staff. The actors who play prisoners on this show have done a very good job portraying a prisoner. Also if you like law and order svu or law and order criminal intent there are many actors from this show that appear in those shows. The only problem with Oz is that it was not long enough. This show could of easily had nine to ten seasons without getting old. Even after the season finale i sill find myself watching Oz all the time on DVD. This show is easily one of the best shows on television. Dont be a fool go watch Oz.',pos
'After a few lean years 1968 was a pretty swell time for Elvis: not only did he make that celebrated Comeback TV Special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well  SPEEDWAY and LIVE A LITTLE LOVE A LITTLE. Therefore personally I can forgive him for the misstep that was STAY AWAY JOE which at best emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering. Sure Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are indeed embarrassing  as respectively a dopey Indian father to Elvis character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on Mr. Presley too - but one is glad to see Elvis surrounded by top veteran Hollywood talent like Katy Jurado (as Merediths Mexican wife) the two Jones  Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic Chief Thundercloud who is Merediths stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day! <br /><br />While there is a surprising (if not unwelcome given their usual blandness) lack of songs there seems to be no shortage of free-for-all parties were the male Indians hit the bottle steadily while Presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs! As can be expected the typically Western Arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point. On the other hand the climactic destruction of the house episode is one weve seen too often since and doesnt work too well here...',neg

Not sure though at least grass doesnt steal jokes. Im honestly trying to save YOUR time. I even tried watching his show. I told myself maybe he isnt THAT bad.. But no he is. I completely zone out when I watched his show. I tried to collect myself during the commercial break and focus on the show but I couldnt. I zoned out again I think I was thinking of something more interesting like re-making my bed vacuuming or folding my socks. Before I knew it the show was over. Yeah its that bad.<br /><br />Heres my final thought - Theres so many things you can do with 30 minutes besides watch this guy shout about nothing for half an hour. Dont watch a show that tries to shove racism in your face in vain. I can support shows that try to ease the tension of the race wars but this guy just provides more racism rather than stop it.',neg

Kevin Spacey the big screen monster plays Prot as it should be done. Lets not forget Jeff Bridges and his great psychiatric. <br /><br />Lastly a masterpiece that speakes for itself.

'Worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the lam after she is linked circumstantially to the death of her husband and sister. Determined to prove that her husband is alive she follows leads across the state her peril increasing at each stop. Chasing after her are the traditional good-cop and bad-cop pair of partners.

'Im a huge lover of really bad B movies. And I especially love alien/scifi movies. I say the cheaper cheesier and campier the better. A low budget and a hokey idea are fun enough for most bad B movies but this movie is so bad that I really felt embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the schlocky ad-lib actors. First off theres no real plot its all sort of situation comedy (if it can be called that). The comedy in this movie is more about characters saying in essence look at me Im in this crazy situation! Isnt this funny? but its only pathetic because nothing anyones doing is that funny. Theres no comedic acting skill nor any kooky plot to carry all the very un-imaginative scenarios through this dreary turd.<br /><br />The bad comedy and lack of anything remotely comical is only worsened by the bad ad-lib acting actors saying really stupid things over and over again (perhaps trying to ape for catch phrases perhaps just b/c everyone in this is so bad) really unattractive women being played off as hot chicks and people barfing and passing out in bathrooms.<br /><br />There was one middle aged actor toward the end of the movie who I could tell had some acting chops and was kinda convincing in his role. He was as out of place as a solid BM in a weekend detox units bathroom. Corey Feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes in total (thankfully we didnt have to put up with him any longer) and he was filmed off site -- probably outside his apartment on the way out somewhere. He said a few really un-funny things about aliens and having sex with aliens and that was the extent of his appearance.<br /><br />If you value your life and the 90 minutes (and years of pain in remembering) youll lose by watching this garbage avoid it. If you do a lot of drugs like Adam Sandlers comedy stylings (and thus have no standards whatsoever) and are considered mentally slow you might like this movie. <br /><br />P.S. I think the people who raved about this must work for Troma or something b/c I cant believe people can be so lame as to actually enjoy this movie. (Do drugs really ruin your judgment that much?)',neg

Do yourself a favor - go to bed instead of watching this! Good night!',neg
'The dog can act...unfortunately nobody else in the cast of this sordid faux childrens film can. A stray yet very clever dog insinuates himself into the lives of two motherless children much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold-hearted father. In what can only be described as Dickensian the evil widower forbids his children --- who may or may not be mentally challenged --- from playing with Benji. Neither the children nor Benji obeys. Soon the children are kidnapped and Benji has to help the police find them. Its only then that the old man realizes that Benji is good not bad.<br /><br />Tom Lester whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dim-witted Eb on GREEN ACRES plays one of the kidnappers. So does the regrettably over-utilized Deborah Walley. Walleys previous screen triumphs include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and the woeful ITS A BIKINI WORLD. She also played both Gidget and Tammy in the past and here attempts to obliterate her good-girl reputation by playing it bad! <br /><br />STAY away from BENJI...hes a dog and this movie is a dog!',neg
'This early John Wayne Lone Star western has a bit more going for it than the run-of-the-mill oaters Wayne had been making for Lone Star up until that time. For one it has his old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix being a much better actor then the standard Lone Star villain brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line-readings often delivered in these oaters. The plot about mistaken identity payroll robbery and murder is as trite and perfunctory as youd expect it to be in a 1930s low-budget western but Waynes strapping good looks easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable. Plump balding Eddy Chandler isnt quite believable as Waynes womanizing partner and theres a running gag about something that happens whenever Chandler and Wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome. On the other hand Waynes love interest is played by none other than Mary Kornman the little Mary of the early Little Rascals fame. She is a grown-up 20-year-old now blonde and cute as a button. Most of Waynes leading ladies in these Lone Star/Monogram Bs were fairly bland and colorless but Mary is perky cute and yes sexy. Theres a scene in the general store where she works in which Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of nerve tonic which happens to be on the top shelf so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf. Waynes ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps then again as she comes down then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935. Wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt. Anyway its an interesting little B not great but not as choppy and random as many of his LoneStar productions of the time. The final gunfight isnt handled all that well and Chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while but all in all its worth a look if only to see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman.',neg
'This movie is the first of the six infamous Guinea Pig Movies and is one of the best. At the same time it looks realistic and unrealistic just knowing that the movie is fake. The story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways. A man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and it includes a manga video showing the torture. The men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die. Some scenes are shocking such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched 100 times because you see punches in nearly every movie. This movie has a lot of gore so I would recommend this to people 17 or older.<br /><br />9/10',pos
'I really wanted to love this movie and not only cause it had Aaron Eckhart in it but I thought the premise would be cool cause I enjoy movies and shows that revolves around chefs. The cinematography was good but besides it being revolved around chefs everything else is just very cliché. Oh and Little Miss Sunshine was very irritating in this movie although Abigail Breslin seems to be a bit irritating in every movie she is in cause she plays a lot of roles where she is whinny. It has some decent flashes of cooking but food really didnt play a big part in the movie than I expected which was a big disappointment for me. This film had some good potential the cast was great but they just had very little to work with. I like a good light hearted romantic comedy but this was just bland. And longer than it should be cause it felt way longer than it is. Its not a terrible movie you just wont miss anything by not watching this movie.<br /><br />4.5/10',neg

'A SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy/Canada 1977).<br /><br />Every once in a while you come across a film that really touches a nerve. This one offers a very simple premise almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. Its surprising Ettore Scolas Una giornate particulare is relatively unheralded even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it rubbish and Leonard Maltin somewhat milder pleasant but trifling. I disagree not only because this film is deeply moving but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most films Ive seen. The cinematography is distinctly unflashy even a bit bland and the storyline straightforward which might explain the films relative unpopularity. Considering late 70s audiences werent exactly spoiled with great Italian films its even stranger this one didnt really catch on with the critics.<br /><br />The film begins with a ten-minute collage of archive footage from Hitlers visit to Italy on may 8th 1938. Set against this background we first meet Antonietta (Loren) a lonely love-ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building. One day when her Beo escapes she meets her neighbour Gabriele (Mastroianni) who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies. He is well-mannered cultured and soon she is attracted to him. During the whole film we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings. After the opening scene the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist (hypermodern at the time) apartment block seemingly searching for our main characters whom we havent met yet. <br /><br />Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type. Canadian born John Vernon plays Lorens husband but he is only on screen in the first and last scene. I figure his voice must have been dubbed since hes not of Italian descent and never lived there to my knowledge so I cannot imagine he speaks Italian. If his voice has been dubbed I didnt notice at all. On the contrary hes completely believable as an Italian even more than the rest of the cast. The story is simple but extremely effective the performances are outstanding the ending is just perfect and the framing doesnt come off as overly pretentious but works completely. Dont miss out on this one.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 9/10',pos
'I rented this film just to see Amber Benson though after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story.....however the first problem was that there really wasnt a story...or actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense. The second problem was there was no set up for these characters...yes I got that they all went to school together but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and didnt like each other...so why did they keep getting together. Flaw number 3...the director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled suspense (especially with the typical suspense music dubbed in)...he was sadly mistaken. It was painful to watch a terrific actress like Amber Benson waste time trying to bring this back to life....my only hope is the money she made here was put toward producing her own film.',neg
'Soylent Green IS...a really good movie actually.<br /><br />I never wouldve thought it. I dont really like Heston in his sci-fi efforts. Hes one of those actors who like Superman manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And indeed he sneers his way through much of Soylent Green too but as hes supposed to be playing an overconfident bully I dont really mind.<br /><br />I can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie. Soylent Green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - it looks just like 1973) and its lacking in action. But I admired the films vision of a complex corrupt and highly stratified society and I was so pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving funny final role. Nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with Heston - really make the movie.<br /><br />The message of Soylent Green is pretty relevant these days when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to. Funny isnt it to see Heston in a prototype Michael Moore movie...',pos
'Finally! Third time lucky. This film has been always been on my mind but my first viewing I forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film. Then only a couple months later I had the my second chance of watching of it so I decided I would record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the flick. I wasnt going to allow that to happen again. So when it came on TV again I thought bugger it Ill wait until it comes on then I will record it. And it was a good choice. I would have just watched the film but they always put on weeknights around midnight. <br /><br />After discovering a hole in their crowded cell nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe which a fellow prisoner known as the Counterfeit King said he had hidden. They think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills. On this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled. Although things dont turn out the way that they intended to with most of the criminals plans going astray. <br /><br />9 Souls is an perky spiritual journey from Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada which flung its viewers into a film of two totally different halves. The first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence drama-packed second half where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with. While the first half is quite amusing with its on the road screwball doodling and offbeat banter. But its really the genuinely haunting latter half with its peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters. Even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes you just become entrenched by these flesh-out characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall you know its an effective drama when you become shell-shocked in the dramatic change. The nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down. The way the plot works out is that Michiru and Torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives. The escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study thats clear in its goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints. <br /><br />While the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told. The visual element doesnt go by unnoticed because theres just a dreamy and trance-like vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere. What HIGHLY contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly moody instrumental rock soundtrack. The mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke. Simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front. The pacing for such an long film ( 2 hours ) seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done because we are just so wrapped up in it all. The hypnotic photography is crisp in detail. While the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves. <br /><br />I found 9 Souls to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction. Highly recommended.',pos
'If in the first 10 minutes of this film you dont realize that the main character who writes a life advice column is going to have the tables-oh-so-cleverly-turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself then there is probably something wrong with you. The set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie even if the rest of the movie was good (which it isnt) <br /><br />Theres almost no chemistry between the leads and Steve Carells stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing not funny. Its hard to believe Binoches character would have any interest in him. Then in the end its all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. Isnt that great America!',neg
'This films premise seems to be that the passing of the World War 2 generation in America with its apple-pie phoniness and hypocritical morality was a terrible tragedy. Those awful hippies ruined everything apparently.<br /><br />What holds the film together are the excellent performances - particularly Lemmons which is truly remarkable. Otherwise we have a boring slice-of-life drama (just over 24 hours of Jacks life) with pretensions.<br /><br />I found it a chore to sit through.',neg
'There is one really good scene in Faat Kine. The title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened Faat Kine sprays her in the face. The scene works because the act is so unexpected bizarre and rather funny at the same time. In that one instance writer/director Ousmane Sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours. In the scene he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions. For the rest of the movie the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones. <br /><br />The tone is all over the place. Its true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre but I dont think Faat Kine fits into any genre. Supposedly its a drama though there are moments of such broad comedy (the aforementioned spraying in the face) that it cannot be taken seriously. On the other hand the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics Sembene has crammed into the picture. There is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together. Unfortunately Semebene doesnt find that balance. Instead one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason leaving two different tones hanging in the wind. <br /><br />Faat Kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale. The film ends with a big party where all the characters conflicts are resolved only they arent resolved quickly. The scene lasts longer than any other scene going on for probably twenty minutes. Because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene making for a frustrating viewing experience.<br /><br />Perhaps I am being too hard on Faat Kine. I am not the right audience for it. I felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story. There are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters. However I was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it.',neg
'From hardly alien sounding lasers to an elementary school style shuttle crash Nightbeast is better classified as a farcical mix of fake blood and bare chest. The almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of cohesive or effective story. The acting however is not nearly as beastly many of the young aspiring actors admirably showcase a hidden talent. Particularly Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel who shed a well needed shard of light on this otherwise terrible film. Nightbeast would have never shown up on set had he known the terrible movie making talent of this small Maryland town.',neg
'Not that I was really surprised....movies are never as good as the books that they originated from. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books even though I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However they strayed from the books storyline too much and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was. Ending was different too. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery. The acting was unremarkable at best. Perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they wouldnt have to stay so much in Lifetimes made for TV movie box it would be a better flick. If you saw this movie I highly encourage you to track down the book and read it. I doubt youll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.',neg
'Not having any idea what this film was about but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing in it we decided to watch it. Well it turned out not to be the wisest decision. In fact as another commentary in this forum puts it we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie.<br /><br />While the film is by no means horrible it doesnt make sense at all. The over the top performance by William Baldwin doesnt help the situation either. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better. The basic problem it seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy and the people in charge ran out of ideas along the way. The result is an uneven film.',neg
'Elizabeth Ward Gracen who will probably only be remembered as one of Bill Clintons bimbo eruptions (they have pills for that now!) is probably the weakest element of this show. It really continues the tired formula of the Highlander Series- The hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met but there is some conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence.<br /><br />Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically your typical unshaven 90s hero with the typical Sexual tension storyline. (Seriously why do you Hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) This was a joint Canadian/French production so half the series takes place in Vancouver imitating New York and the other half is in Paris... Just like Highlander did.',neg
'Kokoda was inspired by events on the Kokoda track during WW2 when Australian militia slowed and ultimately stopped a push by 10000 Japanese soldiers to move overland and capture Port Moresby. What they really mean is that the movie is set in this time period but is fiction and everything that happens is just a jumble of standard scenes from other war films. The first hour is just one cliché after another. Some of the scenes are simply there to be able to draw us into a feeling that this conflict was horrific beyond compare when there appears to be little evidence of this. Both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown by either side. Both sides suffered from logistic shortages and the terrain was a great leveler in this conflict. As the Japanese got closer to Port Moresby their supply line grew and this ultimately led to their downfall. On the other hand as the Australians retreated closer to Port Moresby their supply line decreased. Some of the scenes appear to be straight out of the handbook on standard scenes to include in any war film. The film was misguided and highlighted the youth of the production team. At a time when Australia could have done with a great film about one of Australias best moments the film Kokoda is a shallow disappointment.',neg
'I had never heard of Dead Mans Bounty when I saw it at the DVD store a few weeks ago and I thought I had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem since it had Val Kilmer in it in a truly unique role. Sadly it wasnt more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that I realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions. The first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long. Its unbelievable how bad it is. And sadly it doesnt get any better.<br /><br />Val Kilmer is featured prominently on the movies cover box maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of half-wit crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a unique town sheriff that Ive ever seen in a movie. Hes played by Boguslaw Linda who is unable to or uninterested in covering his Polish accent immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the American old west. <br /><br />Does Poland have this type of frontier past? I dont know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point but I can tell you this The Sheriff as he is known in the movie is the worst representation of law enforcement that I can ever remember seeing in a movie. He is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face. Before they start hitting him he explains that they can each hit him once and then after the first round they will each hit him again and if he can identify who is throwing the punches they lose. What the hell is this crap? I am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie. <br /><br />Throughout the movie the Sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally stumbling on screen and mumbling notwithout...the law You see there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie. <br /><br />It takes place by the way in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings facing each other across a flattened bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road. My understanding is that it is a part of Poland that is supposed to look acceptably enough like the American southwest where none of the characters except maybe the dead guy could possibly have come from.<br /><br />I have heard that Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role and also by director Uklanskis minimal use of dialogue in favor of a reliance on cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages. <br /><br />Yeah whatever. <br /><br />Seems to me that Kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role. Personally I would really feel that I had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while. I like to think that he didnt even read the script for this mess because if he did I am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the role.<br /><br />At any rate the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man played by Kilmer seeking the reward. Soon he finds himself embroiled in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute the alcoholic Sheriff and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid stupid characters. <br /><br />There is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of American rituals. In one scene a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into Kilmers eyes (for what reason I cant imagine) and then later a man makes a short speech over Kilmers corpse in which he explains that he was one of the finest men we ever had and then he proceeds to lop his head off with a shovel. What the HELL?? <br /><br />Not convinced yet? Here are some more reasons not to watch it. In one scene the Sheriff appears to be covered with ash except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red lipstick. A man gets a head wound that drenches his head and body in blood. In a daze he cauterizes it with gunpowder. Smart. Near the end the Sheriff appears to have a broken arm. Sitting at the bar he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm and uses his good arm to pull on the rope lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth rather than using his good arm to drink. Also smart. <br /><br />Why doesnt he just use his good arm? I have no idea. That like everything else in the movie makes no sense whatsoever like the title. Summer Love? Are you kidding me? Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /><br />In the meantime heres something for the IMDb Goofs page  <br /><br />Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers) : This movie got made. HA!',neg
'I have seen this film on a Sunday evening and I must say there is no better way to end the weekend. I am totally pleased with the humor and the warm charm this film offers. It simply leaves me in beautiful mood. Watching this film means having a great time and keep a warm feeling.<br /><br />The film offers sharp black British humor and feels very fresh to me. You really enjoy the story and the characters. Brenda Blethyn is SO great. I dont know exactly why. Shes too old to be a love interest for me and too young to be my mother. But I really feel comfortable when she shows up in the movie.<br /><br />Some may say the story was thin and predictable. But who cares? There simply has to be a happy end dancing in the sunshine! Are the characters stereotypes or cut outs? I dont know- better I dont care! I just loved them and enjoyed watching them.<br /><br />Furthermore I must say that I usually dont like romantic comedies. But this one is outstanding: a black comedy with a heart of gold !!',pos
'As many agree Origin is a beautiful anime artistically. The music graphics and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works. However if you are looking for more than this than I suggest looking else where. The beauty stops short of its appearance and when it really comes down to plot and characters theres nothing special. Action is slow and minimal and the people are flat corny at times and do not act realistically. Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there... So in summary oh my goodness Ive never seen an anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my goodness its like... -poke- people dont act like that. It took a GIANT step forward in graphics and music in anime but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization and unfortunately theres not even that much action to make up for that...',neg

'Conrad Hall went out with a bang. The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on. He did himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films youll ever see.<br /><br />Of course the acting aint bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing the leads! The amount of action in here is just right too: not too much; not too little.<br /><br />None of the characters in here frankly are good guys as Hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss Newman. Hanks only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies!

'My roommate got the No No Nanette soundtrack as a dub on a tape and she proceeded to listen to it non-stop. After it finally totally brainwashed me into submission I found the songs to be irresistible especially the famous I want to be happy but I cant be happy... But of coarse from the soundtrack I had no idea what the film was about. So the other day I saw a copy of it at the video store and I rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the film. I was thinking that it was going to be amazing because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately most of the songs that I loved were nowhere to be found in the video I saw. Now Ive never seen the 1930 version of the musical but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing and beside that the sound was really bad through out and you couldnt really understand what people were saying a lot of the time. Really the only highlights of this film were the outrageous 1940s fashion. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stick out like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre feather muff that she keeps on her fore arm and then has herself wrapped in this net scarf. The one dance sequence is a little weird too with Nanette doing this weird ballet stuff with pin-up girl imagery superimposed on top of her. Actually one more bright spot of the film was the artist Guillespe who dreams of being a fine artist but it currently condemned to drawing pin-up girls for money. I like how Guillespe keeps it old school and disses Nanette when his masterpiece the piece that was to make his career is sold by Nanette for a paltry $5250. Doesnt she realize that that piece was his immortality? Silly rabbit/girl with your feather rabbit ears on your hat. When will you learn? Why doesnt he just pencil in a cigarette before the ad men take the Work away?',neg
'I read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so I thought I should see it. Im a big Francophile and art film lover but I believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something arty or intellectual into something it is not. I will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that I never ever wanted to actually see. Obviously the piano teacher has some major psychological issues but I really did not want to see them displayed so graphically. The film is in essence disgusting. I mean when I saw Requiem for a Dream I was repulsed by the last sort of scene with Jennifer Connelly but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion I felt during this film.',neg

'Yeah well I definitely had regrets about giving up my Saturday night watching this strange little yet very long movie. Apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life. Heres the epitome of the antihero in No Regrets. We have this jerk so messed up so wandering so selfish aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessmans up-and-coming son Jaemin unless it was just that: physical attraction. He claims otherwise that its love. But after watching this its like loving Charles Manson because you dig the beard. (Alright hes not that bad but still no real redeemable characteristics.) I could never get past the reason Jaemin endless stalks Sumin. It was never shown just told that Jaemin loves Sumin. Perhaps its a culture thing that flew over my head: crazy/stalking = mad love over in Seoul. It has to be because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point I thought this was turning into a screwball comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named baby to make an appearance. Okay so Sumin works two jobs while going to school so far so good on someone trying to better themselves. But after his first taste of his stalkers attraction he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring. What? OK well as previously mentioned the obsession doesnt stop due to the job/career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup. Basic movie not 100\% terrible but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies.',neg

'In 1927 a young man alone in a single engine aeroplane flew non-stop from Roosevelt Field in New York across the entire North Atlantic Ocean to Le Bourget Field in Paris a distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles. In this triumph of mind body and spirit Charles A. Lindbergh influenced the lives of everyone on earth--for in the 33 hours and thirty minutes of his flight the air age became a reality. This is the story of that flight.<br /><br />Billy Wilder adapts from Charles A. Lindberghs Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name in what is re-creation of Lindberghs historical 1927 solo flight. Boosted by a considerably strong lead performance from James Stewart {himself a pilot} as Lindberg and containing an intelligent screenplay from Wilder and Wendell Mayes Spirit Of St. Louis is a sincerely well told story.<br /><br />In what at times threatens to become a monotonous film Wilder keeps it ticking over by using flashbacks to Lindberghs life. After the nicely told build up to the event such as the peril being realised as Nungesser and Coli go missing {never to be found} whilst attempting the same trip in reverse we learn stuff like how he come to buy his first plane and his work with the flying circus. This is all relative to understanding the man and his obvious passion for flying. This also helps to give us a complete picture of Lindbergh thus putting us with him in his isolated cockpit as he undertakes this dangerous journey. Battling isolation {his only company is a fly} and chronic tiredness its here where Stewart perfectly portrays Lindberghs devotion to the task. Aided by a terrific score from Franz Waxman and Academy Award nominated effects by Louis Lichtenfield Wilders movie turns out to be an engaging human interest story that got a thoroughly professional production. 7/10',pos
'This ranks as my favorite movie of all time. Its the best spoof of a science fiction movie ever; the fact that it was a sendup of Star Wars just made it all the better.<br /><br />I love slapstick. Think of this as the Marx brothers or the Three Stooges meet Star Wars. The writing is hilarious. The effects are a hoot. The free association that goes on guarantees all sorts of things coming out of left field. (I almost wet my pants when the Wookie Monster accosted the Princess.)<br /><br />Space Balls was a much longer movie but only had about 15 minutes of good material in it and I felt sort of ripped off afterwards like buying a burger that turned out to be mostly filler. Hardware Wars despite being only about 15 minutes long would be worth paying a feature price IMO.',pos

Chico seemed fragmentary with the main character Ricardo staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. As could be expected no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. The excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in various countries.',neg

The characters werent intriguing and I didnt feel for any of them even the dawky fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group.

Comparing it to other films in the same genre ie American Pie is just cruel because there is a film which was laugh-a-plenty. This ACCEPTED failed to raise a smile!',neg
'This is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace Lorenzo Lamas is really cool though!. All the characters are just annoying (except Lamas) and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for! plus the action is very boring. The film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up! plus it looks very cheap and amateurish!. Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma but he cant save this piece of crap and believe it or not the opening was really cool as was the ending however the middle is incredibly boring and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button! plus The dialog is especially laughable!.There is a cool bar scene that i really liked but once Lamas heads to the dock it all falls apart plus the scene where The villains torture Jennifers family and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable!. This is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace Lorenzo Lamas is really cool though! however it is not enough not recommended. The Direction is very bad. George Erschbamer does a very bad job here with mediocre camera work bland location and keeping the film at a boring pace. The Acting is pretty bad (except for Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is awesome here and while he isnt required to act he is quite fun to watch and has a really cool character and had a lot of charisma however even he cant save this oneand he had no chemistry with the cast either! (Lamas Rules!). Josie Bell is terrible here and while shes decent looking she isnt very convincing and had no chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot but does not have much to do but scream and scared she did okay at that.Robert Scott is INCREDIBLY annoying as the main villain and wasnt menacing at all he was laughable as were the other 2.

'This movie was release when I was 15 and I could easily relate to the themes the film portrayed.<br /><br />That was over 24 years ago and I havent seen the movie since. This time around I cringed at some of the acting but still appreciate the film for what it is.<br /><br />Life is not always fair and the good guys dont always win in fact I think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teenager the pricks always did better with a lot of girls. Also it doesnt matter how nice you are you cannot make someone like you. Girls/boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise. Sometimes you just gotta let go and say next.<br /><br />Gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for Karen. This is so true of teenagers when they get fixated on someone.<br /><br />I remember sitting around with mates laughing our arses off at some of the antics. The acting is not quite there compared with Fast Times at Ridgemount High but it kicks ass over this movie simply because FTARH has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending. Nice guys finish last!! Gary comes across as pretty lame cringe worthy material but we all know guys like this who are far to sensitive. We all know a David fun guy who makes you laugh.<br /><br />Some people on here bag the ending but hello the ending is exactly what can happen in real life. Some chicks just go back for more no matter how bad the dude treats them especially at that age. I have experienced that first hand.<br /><br />Great sound track too!!

'Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative inventive and prolific directors of all time because he is arguably all of these things. It takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties. Saboteur however is not creative or prolific at all. Rather Hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster American Pride a certain call-to-arms support-our-troops title which was a popular theme of the time. With that in mind Hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film including but not limited to a logical plot characterization believable dialog and a fluent running storyline. <br /><br />Typically Hitchcock does great with espionage films only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps but seemingly lost his stride in creating Saboteur and merely recycled the same once-thrilling story lines both his previous excursions readily provided. Without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems: <br /><br />1. Despite having his face plastered on every newspaper across America the only person who recognizes Kane is blind.<br /><br />2. At the dinner party Kane and Patricia dont want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were gate crashers. Logically what prevents the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening? Besides does anyone need to be reminded Kane is a wanted terrorist?<br /><br />3. Since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs? <br /><br />4. Nobody recognizes him...his face is on EVERY NEWSPAPER!!! <br /><br />5. The spies catch up with Kane in the ghost town and assume hes the man Freeman sent to work with them...shouldntt he have some sort of credentials? I know spies dont run around with name tags and photo IDs but a secret handshake maybe? <br /><br />6. Cop picks up Kane escaping from Freemans house still seems no one recognizes this guy.<br /><br />7. How exactly does the FBI come to believe Kane with no evidence? They dont even show Kane talking to the FBI the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher.<br /><br />8. When the cops search the Carnival Caravan how do they know Kane is now with a woman? The blind man believed Kanes story thus logically would not have reported his daughter missing kidnapped or even more importantly running with Kane. Why does this movie not employ logic?<br /><br />This is a running list. The movie is not exciting the plot makes no sense and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing. Hitchcock fails miserably on this one.',neg
'Or maybe thats what it feels like. Anyway The Bat People is about as flat as a rug bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock...and as intelligent as all three combined.<br /><br />Okay plot in a nutshell (fitting vessel that...): a doctor (Moss) gets bitten by a bat while checking out a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and subsequently turns into a bat - well not exactly a bat but a bat-like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first-person camera viewpoint....<br /><br />But then theres the business of the sheriff (Pataki) who is about the WORST kind of sheriff: the hick kind. He hassles people he leers at married women he steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries (the FIEND!) he smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and talks at the same time making him look and sound like Buford T.

But for my money theres just too much of John Huston and poor Rex Reed isnt hardly given a fighting chance. His character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines wondering what hes doing in this film.<br /><br />The low user rating should give an idea as to the publics opinion of this piece. Vidals original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted. Not even the classic film clips did much. All in all a rather sub par effort and its not likely to get much better with time.',neg
'By all accounts this could have been an interesting film. Featuring a score by the mighty Cradle Of Filth starring their frontman Dani and being hyped up as the future of British horror I expected Alex Chandons gore fest to live up to the hype.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Everything about this film is either cliche or inept. The short story anthology setup was done to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. Admittedly the idea of the sick room did send a chill down my spine but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting.<br /><br />Chandon cannot write dialogue. Every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence (the typical cop on the edge formula. funny im sure ive seen that somewhere else before...) No Chandon you are not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. It sounds BAD. Add ludicrously OTT acting with very dodgy casting (dont get me wrong Dani Filth is a great singer and musician but actor he aint) and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing. Give me Bruce Campbell any day.<br /><br />The visual effects are on the whole poor with some atrocious CGI awful gore effects (for goodness sakes Peter Jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget) and editing filters that shriek OVER-USE! As for the often mistimed use of Cradle Of Filths score... man they should sue.<br /><br />The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience. too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects (eg: maniac zombie flesh eaters the beyond suspiria etc) rendering Cradle of Fear in my mind second-rate and obsolete.<br /><br />I hope Chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares.<br /><br />Better luck next time.',neg

'I found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible.<br /><br />The only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was Lacy Chaberts performance who I thought played the multiple personalities really well. For me she was definitely the highlight of this movie.<br /><br />Dina Meyer was pretty as always but I found her role pretty bland so I dont think one can say that her acting was great.<br /><br />As for the male lead Armand Assante his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series.<br /><br />All of that I could have lived with. However the terrible terrible terrible end/solution the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing I have seen in a long time.',neg
'If you would have asked me 1 month ago how this movie was I probably would have left most of this out but I am a fan and as any fan I visit the movies sites often well when Super Troopers came out I visited that site after the release on DVD and was hooked yea its a difficult site to stay on but the good ones normally are like good families they stick together. What a story this company/comedy troop has.BEGGING people to come and see there movies on street cornersuniversities anywhere they can and all for free and after all that to develop a great fan base after a few years THEY CRAP ON IT And decide to close down there website that helped them and was created for the fans but the worst thing about it....THEY DIDNT TELL ANY OF THEM. They just decided that they are better than us they want new fans not the fans that helped them get where they are....you know the same fans they begged years ago. Still the smart crew they are they released the best movie with Super Troopers and got everyones attention and thank God for that because after that they have sucked with everything else. Good for you guys way to go mainstream just remember when you realize your material isnt that good and you have no new fans left you are the ones who crapped the original ones away. FANS MAKE YOU WHO YOU ARE NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Never burn your bridges',neg
'The Beautiful Country is a big disappointment. It doesnt come up to my expectation. Bihn a tall muscular guy is a son of an American GI and a Vietnamese woman during Vietnam War. We were told that that he was treated less than dust in Vietnam in the early 90s so he fleeted to America to seek his American father.<br /><br />Sounds like a heart broken material? Maybe but showing in this film. I find myself having a hard time to connect to Bihn emotionally because the film is full of cliché and I simply dont understand or believe him. The writing of this film is a total failure. The plot is full of holes. It grabs some events on a needed basis trying hard to stir the emotion of the audience. We are not that stupid and it doesnt work that way. Lets see what the film is trying to do. So you dont feel Bihns boat trip (yeah he was on a boat!) is hard enough lets have a storm over night and let the ship shake a little. Still not touched? Fine! Get a little kid to suffer the heat the hungry the sickness the violence with the adults on the boat hopefully that will do the trick to touch the audience. Still not touched? You heartless SOB lets... OK I dont want to give any spoiler of the film but you get the idea.<br /><br />The film is really long and slow. It never tell us why Bihn didnt go to find his mom and dad until the moment in the film when he left to look for his mom and dad. What has he been doing the 20 some years before he went to Saigon to look for his mom? And guess what? He has the luck and everybody will tell him where to find the person he is looking for and he will find anybody without a scratch. I really think the Department of Homeland Security should hire those Vietnamese who helped Bihn. The beautiful country? Which one? Both Vietnam and America seem hell to Bihn.',neg
'A Must See!<br /><br />Excellent positive African-American Love Story. This movie had reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad. More true to life characters looking for love being in love and loosing it. Old story fresh view. Larenz Tate was so Cary Grant in style as the character may have been in a clumsey situation but the actor kept him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut out. Nia Long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black man<br /><br />This movie is a classic superb acting well written a real love story set in Chicago what more can you ask for?<br /><br />SuperB Black Love Story<br /><br />Amsterdam Holland',pos
'Watched Uzumaki last night and right away was reminded of two early Peter Weir films from Australia The Last Wave and Picnic At Hanging Rock. They were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror. Uzumaki to me seems clearly influenced by these films. It has a number of fairly mundane scenes that become more portentous the deeper you are sucked in by the film. It also has more scenes of outright horror and although I dont think the film actually measures up to those two films it is well worth the time of most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair but I must say that years after seeing The Last Wave the film still stays with me and it is precisely Picnic At Hanging Rocks unresolved ending that makes it so haunting. p.s. All the people criticizing the acting... pullleasse...in this genre?',pos
'I thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey Tarzan concept made so popular by Hollywood Weismuller et al.<br /><br />Yes; there is a lot of silly stuff. But then the idea is silly. It is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees. I am tempted to say completely unbelievable but that the concept has never been tried. And there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. Though under the circumstances I can see how that would be very difficult to avoid. We also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthood.<br /><br />Still if you can get your head around that lot theres a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring. Lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb. I am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role I have seen him play. There are plenty of other excellent performances too. Not least of which are Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm.<br /><br />What is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the simian perception of humans. We get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor dumb helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it. And it demonstrates well how the phony civilisation and morality with which we cloak and justify our conduct is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance. It may seem a little overstated at times especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms but what we see isnt just a truth about the Victorians; its a truth about the way we are today. Its one that needs to be stated and cannot be stated often enough. Holms characters obsession with the ray-zor as a symptom of civilisation - as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned - is an excellent case in point. Primitive bearded readers take note.<br /><br />The story is depressing. Ultimately its a tragedy. Because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human civilisation; we know hes doomed. Before the third millennium is 50 years old wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excess.<br /><br />In the end its a tale about ourselves. The path to extinction that other simians tread must eventually be followed by humans.<br /><br />Highly recommended for its ethical take despite the hokey moments.',pos
'Excellent film. The whole picture was filmed in Budapest so I feel proud. My little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (M?V) and it is plain to see that they were used in big train not in the local railway - according to the story Chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations. Apart from this the film is superb.',pos
'This is one of those movies that make better trailers than full-length feature films. The concept was really cool and different the humor was unique I just felt there were missed opportunities to put the punch into this movie. So many lines and gags were left hanging too long with no definite ending and really didnt leave me laughing. Wilson Wilson Farris & Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was under-used in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me more of a DVD rental. Also I was looking for some sort of a feel-good music video during the end credits something that has become sort of a trade-mark to these romantic comedy films a la Something About Mary Meet the Parents but again I was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this COULD have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines. It felt like it was RUSHED into theaters.',pos
'I saw Dark Harbor at the 98 Seattle Film Festival. Filmed against a autumnal Maine backdrop this movie boasts an excellent cast and a plot that keeps you guessing throughout. At times eerie at times funny I have to say that it stayed with me for days after seeing it. Rickman and Walker are wonderful as the icy marrieds and Reedus is someone youll be hearing more from Im sure. The opening shot of a winding deserted road in a downpour at dusk (and the score that accompanied it) set the tone so well -- just terrific. Nice nice work from a new-ish director/screenwriter and his talented crew.',pos
'This film makes several nods to various science fiction films. The prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of THX-1138 (the trailer for BUCK ROGERS here it was clips from some early Japanese SF TV show). Then the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard reminding one immediately of BLADERUNNER. The BLADERUNNER aspect comes even<br /><br />more pronounced when we meet the hero who is called a Replicant (He is blond haired and is called Ryo a homage to Roy Batty Rutger Hauers character in BLADERUNNER?). A battle scene soon ensues which reminds one immediately of THE MATRIX. The government forcing the population to take drugs is like THX-1138 and the chief enforcer while looks like a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd turns out to be a robot very much like the TERMINATOR. The end battle reminds one of TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is hilarious. Probably not one of the best SF films out there but is enjoyable certainly a lot more enjoyable than tripe like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.',pos
'Home Alone 3 is the first of the Home Alone movies not to feature Culkin in the main role and the same villains. However the plot is very similar to the original Home Alone film. Instead of two comical villains we get three or four of them. This film involves some traps but it also has a long scene with a remote-control car. The slapstick humour is consistent as well but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film. (No pun intended.) This film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did and there really is not the warm holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had. Its more of a pure comedy but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me. I would not recommend this film; its pretty boring. If you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy then watch the original Home Alone movie.',neg
'I agree with most if not all of the previous commenters Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement.<br /><br />I have seen Zatoichi 1-131516; I believe 14 has not been released on Zone 1 (usa). Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing. The story line was complicated and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous Zatoichi story lines. At one point I was wondering if I was not seeing a remake of a previous Zatoichi film.<br /><br />This film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects (a head rolling limbs severed blood) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character. All the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action and won a great following without having to resort to effects.<br /><br />I am just hoping that the remaining Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend. This is the first Zatoichi film from his studio. I highly recommend all the previous Zatoichi films -- and recommend them.',neg
'I watched this movie and hoped for something to get better the entire time. What is so great about a guy with no emotion? *yawn*<br /><br />You never see Alex show emotion for anyone other than his son. Yeah I know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper (if you can call it that) I get it.<br /><br />Characters are undeveloped relationships arent given enough time to be understood. In one scene Sarah says they wont fall in love and the next time we see her shes talking about how his death really shook her up because they were so close? Logic synapses abound in this film.<br /><br />Its like someone watched Boogie Nights and wrote this part to mimic Little Bill. Even the scene where he loses his temper is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife down to the facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - been there done that - can you say Magnolia?<br /><br />This movie didnt only lack emotion it lacked substance a good script developed characters and a plot. And it certainly lacks my recommendation. :)<br /><br />~A~',neg
'When I first watched Zoey101 with my sister we thought it was a piece of garbage. No one is that rich and lives at a dorm off the pacific coast. In the show Zoey is a mega popular rich girl that everyone always go to her for advice. Zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her no matter how stupid her idea is. She is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure. And she is such a dietetic freak she talks about carbs like she knows what they are. When she sees that her friends are eating chocolate she confiscates it. And another thing that ticks me off is that she is always chewing a piece of spearmint every time you look at her. And everyone wants something do with her for example in one episode that Logan guy bid $4000 to have her and her friends cheer for everything he does in his pathetic life. And her friend Nicole is an overly perky freak that screams a lot.And Lola dresses like a hoochie Houdini lady. 80s called they want there bushy hair back.Might as well shave off the hair chase. This show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to make them think that if they dont have the latest I-Pods and designer clothes they will hate themselves. <br /><br />This show is a big thumbs down. <br /><br />We hate you Jamie Lynn <br /><br />Best wishes Ryan and Kara L',neg
'I dont get this. The movie obviously has a pretty good budget. It has very good cinematography. It has nice pacing good editing and pretty good directing too. Then WHY OH WHY didnt they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and WHY OH WHY did they hire such lousy actors that cant act their way out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. At most times it LOOKS good and FEELS good but in the end you realize that the movie was no good at all.<br /><br />So I would say its a good production but a bad movie. Too bad actually.<br /><br />And eels? Come one really!',neg
'I couldnt relate to this film. Im surprised that people are lauding it for being so realistic. How many people at your school were victim to incest? How many closet homosexual jocks were there? How many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm. OK you wouldnt know even if their were. But really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with. And yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored. But hey wheres the entertainment in that?<br /><br />With regards to the girl who committed suicide - I found this to be exploitative. I actually think MANY people in High School at some stage feel invisible ignored and unwanted. But what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed? The filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative. I didnt buy it as a real life scenario.<br /><br />And the problems of the other students I didnt fully relate to. Bullying is explored but thats been done to death we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person. Closet homosexuality? Pfft another cliché gets rolled out. Thats the thing really too many clichés. I guessed the ending at the start. There was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense. Youve got all these characters with explosive problems and one with apparently none. And I thought what is the point of this character unless shes the unsuspecting suicide victim? And surely enough..<br /><br />One thing I will say and it is the saving grace of the film is that it does NOT glamourise suicide. The suicide is very graphic and heart-breaking to watch. It is a powerful scene (regardless of how contrived it is)and one that dismisses suicide as the easy option. But the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes.<br /><br />Not bad but certainly not groundbreaking OR worthy of a 17-minute standing ovation at Cannes???',neg
'So Seagal plays a DEA detective named John Hatcher who lost his partner on a drug investigation into surprise surprise Colombia! Not to brag or anything but my father was born and raised in Colombia (hence my last name) and now hes a doctor in California so no matter what the movies would have you believe there are some things other than drug dealers and cocaine that come out of Colombia!<br /><br />At any rate in a drug bust gone bad Hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked Colombian prostitute inspiring him to go to confession somewhere that I have never seen him go before in any of his movies before or since. It was actually pretty interesting. Seagal has a tendency to come off as almost asexual the way he never gets much involved with women other than as a plot device and the way the occasional seduction attempt whether by a stripper or by a lover never piques the slightest bit of interest from him. Hes all get-the- bad-guys all the time. <br /><br />But in the confession booth he confesses to having lied sold drugs falsified evidence and even slept with informants in order to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars (I hope Im not getting in trouble with God by telling you this). The priest tells him to go to his family so he decides its time to retire from the force. <br /><br />The next third of the movie is an exercise in the paper-thin characterization characteristic of Seagals films. Marked For Death is the story of Seagal against a band of mystic Jamaican drug dealers and these guys have no discretions about pushing their products in broad daylight.<br /><br />Hatcher goes back to visit his old high school coach Max (a minimal effort by Keith David) and right in the middle of practice there are some of these dread-locked crackheads sitting right there in the bleachers peddling crack to some bookworm-looking high school girls.<br /><br />Maybe I just had a sheltered experience in high school but I didnt know crack dealers and crackheads hung out AT SCHOOL in the MIDDLE OF THE DAY. At any rate its not long before Hatcher learns how evil these guys are. Theyre not just peddling crack to high school kids but the coach has been losing football players regularly to their drugs they engage in smartass stare-downs with Max and since thats not enough his 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse.<br /><br />Ah OK. We get the picture. Im sure they also torture puppies and beat up old women and maybe steal candy from children too just for good measure. Is it really this hard to establish who the bad guys are? 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse. Wow.<br /><br />Anyway. Not only does the movie not know how to develop villains without resorting to what basically boils down to movie name-calling where evil deeds are shallowly assigned to them through dialogue but they also dont know how they should act. <br /><br />The leader of the drug dealers is named Screwface and I suppose that alone should tell you something about the kind of movie this is. Screwface is a cartoonish Jamaican man with these bright bizarrely green eyes which I am guess must be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his screen time with his eyes half bulging out of his head. His favorite means of intimidation is to scream really loud in his wildly overblown Jamaican accent with his face quite literally less than an inch away from whoever hes yelling at. This guy likes to get so into guys faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses dont touch. All I could think about was how the poor guys would deal with his breath.<br /><br />Man they do not want you to forget that these guys are Jamaican by the way. Their accents are so exaggerated and overblown that for most of the movie its nearly impossible to understand them. Not that it matters. It doesnt matter what theyre saying all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil drug-related thing theyre just the psychos that peddle drugs and kill people. The movie must have been a huge hit in Jamaica!<br /><br />My biggest problem with the movie is that the theatrics particularly of the bad guys as Ive described are spectacularly goofy even for a Seagal film. They are so cartoonish and weird that its impossible to take them as anything other than a goofball b-movie creation something slapped together to provide fodder to whom Seagal can distribute his characteristic brand of smack-down retribution. <br /><br />But there is also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the movie that just makes it all come off as weird. For example a mystic I guess you would call her at one point puts some kind of curse on Screwface by (if I remember correctly) spitting mouthfuls of Bacardi onto a live rooster thats hanging upside down before beheading it and dripping its blood onto a picture of Screwface. Hmm. Interesting. <br /><br />Sadly its this same woman that warns Hatcher that his family has been marked for death by these people meaning theyve got some voodoo hex on them. Not to belittle anyone but if I was told that my family had been cursed by people like that I would just laugh at it. Hatcher doesnt strike me as the kind of guy to take much stock in freaky voodoo curses! <br /><br />But the set-up as you can see is pretty standard for a Seagal film. Unique villains I guess you could say although not very impressive. Definitely the weirdest film of Seagals early career',neg
'On the cusp of being insufferable. Somehow I stayed just slightly interested but was it because I truly wanted to know what the secret was (which I should say is pretty damned obvious) or because I hoped Scarlett Johansson would put on a more sexy outfit? This movie is poor and whats more its a disgrace to all the lonely alcoholic Southern literature professors out there. Travolta wants his Oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating blood. Sorry pal. . .you were more believable is Staying Alive.

'I like both this version of DORIAN GRAY and the MGM version. Both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have an association with Dorian (this is not in the original book) and that is my only complaint. I especially like Angela Lansbury as Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version but Shane Briant as Dorian in the TV-version is much better looking (I think) and far more ruthless than Hurd Hatfield in the MGM version: I think Briant is more true to the novels Dorian. In the end this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even hints at Dorians liaisons with men as does Wylde which could not be done in the MGM version).',pos
'This British pot-boiler has one thing going for it: the young men are uniformly good looking. The older men are opinionated right-wing Thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the Reagan/Thatcher years. Young or old however morals in this three-part mini-series are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well.<br /><br />Nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of Oxford. It is not pivotal to the story but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier. Nick comes to London with a friend whose father Gerald is a rich conservative politician and babysits his sister Cat while the family frolics in the south of France. They neglect to inform him that when upset Cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen implements. Nick mistakes their self-serving gratitude for affection and moves in finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him. Inexplicably Nick lives in this house for four years but as the plot depends on this point its best not to question it.<br /><br />While Nick is most pleasing to look at he is unbearably obsequious. His coy subjection to rich bigots soon had me climbing the walls. Deeply closeted except to Cat (she guesses his big secret on sight) he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay. Though it hardly seems possible Nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he.<br /><br />Supercilious Tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film so imagine the venom which spews forth when Nicks sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid. Gerald in true Tory fashion has become involved in several personal and financial scandals so the revelations about Nick add to his embarrassment. This gives Gerald one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy.<br /><br />Except for one brief moment of indignation Nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement. Denial self-loathing naiveté or ignorance? You decide if you can manage to sit through this whole thing without throwing something at the set.',neg
'Its possible that A Man Called Sledge might have been done irreparable damage on the cutting room floor. Maybe someone will demand a directors cut one day but I seriously doubt it.<br /><br />James Garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in doing so brought a whole lot of Americans over to fill the cast out. Folks like Dennis Weaver Claude Akins John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow who both wrote and directed this film.<br /><br />Garner always gets cast as likable rogues because hes so darn good at playing them. But he has played serious and done it well in films like The Childrens Hour and Hour of the Gun. He can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully. But A Man Called Sledge cant be counted as one of his successes.<br /><br />Hes got the title role as Luther Sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head. After partner Tony Young gets killed in a saloon and Garner takes appropriate Eastwood style measures hes followed from the saloon by John Marley.<br /><br />Marleys spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run. Garner gets his gang together for a heist.<br /><br />Heres where the movie goes totally off the wall. Usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning. Certainly that was the case in The War Wagon which some other reviewer cited. But in this one Garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake US Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed. <br /><br />That was just too much to swallow. If taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before. But I will say for those who like the blood and guts of Italian westerns during that prison break theres enough there for three movies.<br /><br />Thats not the whole thing of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends. But by that time the whole film has lost a lot of coherency.<br /><br />The great movie singer of the Thirties Allan Jones is listed in the credits. But for the life of me I cant find him in the film. Maybe a chorus of the Donkey Serenade might have made this better.<br /><br />Couldnt have hurt any.',neg
'Masters of Horror has proved itself a poor arena for message episodes and while a definite case can be made for Joe Dantes Screwfly Solution (one of the best episodes of the series period) most efforts to do so have come across as anvil-heavy and unimpressive (nothing defuses horror more than a soapbox). And Pro-Life simply fuses reactionary viewpoints with ultra-violence; young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs) seen running through the woods is nearly hit by 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who just happen to be driving in to work at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angeliques father Dwayne (Ron Perlman) is a stone-cold far-right holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. If for nothing else Pro-Life accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue but John Carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifference--he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself (which is admittedly poor); the slow pacing builds no tension and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl. Even when Dwayne and his sons storm the clinic guns blazing it is a stunning non-event; later when a doctor is tortured with a male abortion the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary--an effort to pad out the underwritten film. The poor performances (Perlman is sadly wasted here) become an outgrowth of the script and Carpenters direction feels exhausted as if Pro-Life is the source of his next hot meal. By the time a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking...',neg
'Taken in the context of the time it was made I found this a worthwhile movie. While the details may be dramatized the overall history was a nice primer. In addition I found spotting actors I knew a real pleasure. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad? Ill leave the rest of the star spotting to you. As to the secondary casting this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor but top kudos to Andrew Jacksons right hand man Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well shot with beautiful ships and competent acting throughout out I recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp or an eye for a double-period piece set at the dawn of America and made in a period when great names and top notch character actors were a real pleasure to enjoy.',pos

'Ridiculous fluff that compounds its error by trying to have meaning. Joan this time as a congresswoman Agatha Reed chairwoman of a committee dedicated to investigating the high cost of food. Says Congresswoman Reed The housewife has been getting it in the neck too long. Im going to keep fighting long enough so that the American family can take a vacation once a year see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant. Shes all business but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from Good Hope College where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night (the parallel to Joans real life is unmistakable here as it is in all Joan Movies). The degree causes much consternation on campus (That would make it the most broad-minded institution in the history of education!)  but Joan is unaware of this as she arrives. The college president Jim Merrill played by Robert Young at his handsomest happens to be Joans former teacher  and lover. It was with *him* that she spent the night out all those years ago but Joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married. Naturally this high-profile event will be covered by *Life* magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be? Yet another of Joans old lovers  this one she hung out with in China during the war and he thinks Joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame. Eve Arden playing Joans assistant Woodie is at her butchest and most smart-alecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job if you didnt like her so much. But you not only like Eve in this as in all her roles you adore her. She is so droll and no-nonsense youd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys. When Joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater Eve tells her it looks fierce. But Joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings she Joan sees youth  herself at 18 eager expectant  a little frightened asking What is life? What am I? But of course if we actually go into depth about Joan at 18 the truth may be a little different. <br /><br />For me this is the major problem in watching any Joan movie. You can call her characters whatever you want to but its always all Joan all the time. So since what were always seeing is Joan being herself its easy to dispense with characters names. Its just that it gets confusing when Joan tries to tell us something patently untrue like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18 Joan had already been around the block several times. Many men would have described her as eager and as far as being expectant she had already had several abortions at this point. But thats a personal problem and I digress but I simply wanted to explain why I say things such as and then Joan does this or that or We see Joan as... when we are not literally watching a home movie.<br /><br />There is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which Joan is given the Clara Bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that Joan and Clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe Joan is much younger than she actually looks. It fails. What also fails is an attempt at early-50s political correctness. In the story Joan has written a book about free speech and made a film (no not the one about the plumber) and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical Dr. Pitt who is about to be fired for his views which are shockingly similar to Joans. This is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one to be sure but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion.',neg
'I LOVED this flick when it came out in the 80s and still do! I still quote classic lines like say it again and you said youd rip my balls off sir. Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it was underrated and disowned by MAD I have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that I would take with me if sent to a deserted island! I only wish that someone would release the DVD because my VHS tape is about worn out! If you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! It is military humor at its best and worse! Rent it if you cant own it!',pos
'honestly I dont know why this show lasted as long as it did. ah well humor is subjective eh? but yeah this show is incredibly unfunny if you ask me. Tim Allen is annoying. Jill is annoying. the boys are annoying. Al is annoying. the neighbor is annoying. its just more annoying then funny. the plots are all the same Tim makes Jill mad and has to make things right again. and the latter seasons? less said about them the better who the hell things cancer would be good for a damn sitcom? yeah great idea jerks. so yeah home improvement isnt a very good sitcom. Id recommend you go watch News Radio or Seinfeld. if i had to give this show a rating Id give it a 1/10 seeing as it never made me laugh once. ever. so yeah its still better then The Nanny though.',neg
'In my opinion a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. The point should be revealing the truth. This means in particular having among the interviewees experts on the subject and representatives of all sides. This film is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of men off the street expounding on the question of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself the supposed subject of the film is given no serious treatment at all. For most of the interviews the interviewer simply waits to be approached and asks general questions such as what do you think of the wall? - she does not approach random people near the wall and ask them how they have been directly affected by it. Outside of one interviewee the Israeli general in charge of the walls construction we have no experts on the subject to provide us with the walls context (e.g. how and when the project began whether it has been successful which groups are for and which against the project etc.)<br /><br />Outside of the interviews a very large portion of the film consists of extended shots of uneventful scenes such as head-on shots of the wall construction of the wall and people getting off a bus. These shots take up far too much time in my opinion. Its nice to see what the wall looks like but the 20-30 minutes of head-on filming of the wall (and only the wall) are excessive. Clearly these shots (accompanied by Arabic music that conveys a sense of mourning) are included for the sole purpose of arousing in viewers feelings of loathing for the wall.',neg
'I actually quite enjoyed this show. Even as a youngster I was interested in all sports and that included horse racing. It was always going to be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record filming about this controversial subject. One episode I particularly remember centred around a horse expected to win a big race that looked a bit off colour. A syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it had been drugged but nothing showed up in the blood tests. All too late they realised the horse hadnt been doped but had had its knee cartilage removed. Like running a car with no oil and the engine seizing up the horse broke down with tragic consequences.',pos
'First off let me say that I am a great believer in Fanpro stuff. I see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent efforts. So I have a soft-spot for fanpro stuff that means Ill overlook things that I would ordinarily slate badly.<br /><br />So on to ST: HF. Well first off the good things. Enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and for the most part the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles. Next the effects arent bad for a home-brew effort with nothing to make you really wince. The stories arent too bad either. Nothing particularly innovative but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing story-arcs.<br /><br />But it has a lot of faults.<br /><br />First off although they quite obviously HAVE to rip-off Star Trek footage set backdrops music and effects I see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other sci-fi musical score ever made. Everything from Aliens to Starship Troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another. Likewise much of the footage is from other movies dutifully CGId over to make it look different. The Grey warships for instance though disguised are quite obviously Star Destroyers from Star Wars. And the station is also rather obviously Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga from Starship Troopers. Likewise sound effects from various Star Wars movies appear in space battles between fighters as does animated over footage. In one scene in either first or second season I think you even see two TIE fighters fly past during a battle which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favours.<br /><br />Acting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch. Everyone does improve as the seasons progress though but expect to grimace at the screen a lot especially in the early seasons. Theyve also made some interesting acting choices. Lets just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to cake and leave it at that.<br /><br />Make-up effects are generally quite effective on the whole. But they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for anything other than background use or passing shots. They are just beyond unrealistic. Every time I saw one of these (apart from trying not to laugh too much) I kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that This is a stick-up! In one scene a Cardassian actually talks whilst wearing one of these. Not only do the lips not move but the mask doesnt even have an opening where the mouth should be. Someone needs to be slapped hard for that. Couldnt they have taken a craft knife to it for goodness sake! There are also some well-done but unintentionally funny make-up jobs such as the Herman Munster look alike.<br /><br />The writing though coherent is nothing new. Instead the script runs like a continuation of DS9 with the ships heading out from DS12 on various missions. The new enemy The Grey arent very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the Borg threads. i.e. Starfleet meet the Grey the Grey are hugely powerful Starfleet barely escape with their lives then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc. All done before with the Borg.<br /><br />Another bone of contention is the dialogue. Star Trek writers have long had the ability to write insert technobabble here into a script. It usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using quantum phase discriminators or isolytic charges etc. In other words nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at hand.<br /><br />The words are just gibberish really. Ive no problem with this but where ST:HF makes a mess of it is where they include real-world comments into this concept.<br /><br />Tactical advice such as We need to regroup sounds good but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group. Likewise when asked what the situation is a tactical officer is heard to reply We count three battleships. He actually needed to count them? Cmon! I expected the questioner to ask him Are you sure? or Can you double check. But my all-time favourite comment is this: <br /><br />Captain: Can we establish two-way communication?<br /><br />Comms officer: No we can only send and receive..<br /><br />Well duh!.....<br /><br />Having said all the above the show does improve as it goes along. Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad 3 shows an improvement but 4 & 5 are where it starts to get noticeably better. Season 6 so far looks quite reasonable.<br /><br />I do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though. Quicktime sucks quite frankly and the sooner they move to divx/avi format the better. Some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny QT window on a computer monitor. Not only does Quicktime make this difficult but the 320x180 resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well. In fact it makes the shows pretty unwatchable like they were a tenth-generation VHS tape copy. The least they could do was to include a hi-res downloadable option.<br /><br />Anyway the show has promise and Im even beginning to like some of the characters. But thats 40 episodes on so Im not sure this says that much about character development at all.<br /><br />But what can you say its free....<br /><br />PS: Out of 28 votes 19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10. Hmmmm... were we watching the same show? Or are you 19 all three year olds?',neg
'This film wasnt good at all. I was able to catch it at a film festival and didnt appreciate the content I was forced to watch. Its a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the familys cornerstone (Gabrielle Union) dies. the film stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielles Unions brother. Well actually Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her early years which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams older sister. This had to be Billy Dee Williams worst performance in his career ever. He looked as if he didnt remember his lines in a few scenes. He was an unlikable hardly ever empathetic character who fathered a daughter while married to a white woman whom he already had a daughter with as well. The two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman (Lucy) was trying to connect with him his other daughter didnt want anything to do with him. Billy Dees character was so pathetic that the only way they can get him to fly in from Paris for his sisters funeral was by telling him that the funeral had already passed and his late sister left him with the responsibility of handling her paperwork. Why they had to fool him? Because he didnt like attending funerals. I know. Youre asking but he didnt want to attend his own sisters funeral too? Yes! He claims he didnt like being around the forced feelings of emotions that is shared amongst the people paying their respects. He didnt want anything to do with that. Now were suppose to empathize with that a**hole? The rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters. The director and editor didnt care to consider the pacing of the film. The flashbacks were painful to watch. It was a bad film. However it seems to be the favorite at black film festivals; a film that glorifies African-Americans dependence on Caucasians to find a love that they can settle down with even if it is a healthy relationship. When lame love stories like this win best of festivals at the black film festivals it makes me question the judgment of black people on film. In these same festivals the only films that win awards are educational films about African American culture and black films directed by Caucasian directors. Im not saying that anything is wrong with a white person directing stories written for people of color. The problems with these films is that they never argue from both point of views which are usually the films that actually speaks to the masses. These films are often one-sided forms of didacticism. These films fail at executing the powers of both sides of the argument that the film is revolved around. The writers and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. These films always slant the argument. What I am saying is are the people running these black film festivals judging a film off of pure content which to me means directing acting writing cinematography editing etc. or are they judging films off of strictly the message being delivered about African American culture? Are we suppose to expect a film like Constellation to have a shot in the world against films like Million Dollar Baby and Sideways? What happened to film being entertaining? When I mean entertainment I mean the ritual of sitting in the dark staring at the screen investing tremendous concentration and energy into what one hopes will be satisfying meaningful emotional experience. Why cant these festivals appreciate films that get their messages across without preaching? Why cant these black film festivals acknowledge films that are well told pieces of work that are brutally honest telling the truth? I believe we have no responsibility to cure social ills or renew faith in humanity to uplift the spirits of society or even express our inner being. We have only one responsibility: to tell the truth.--Robert McKee. Now thats something I totally agree with. These same black film festivals put down Hustle and Flo as if it is that awful film stereotyping blacks. However its an honest film about a pimp with a dream. A pimp cant dream? I recall the last time I saw a real pimp he was a human being. And arent they pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society at large not just in the black community but all over? The powers that be in black Hollywood believe that films like this are making Afro-Americans look bad in the eyes of others as if others dont know that there are pimps in the hood. The truth is until African American people in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world then our films will never have a chance in the world. This film was awful. The best thing was the cinematography and Zoe.',neg
'Having seen both Fear of a Black Hat and This is Spinal Tap I can honestly state that while similar both movies are truly must see. There will be many times in Fear that will have you in hysterics. It is no wonder why both movies have such a huge cult following. Fear will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you must but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.',pos
'Once again Woody Allen seems to be completely devoid of any inspiration other than recycling himself. Here we have a mock documentary (like Zelig) the structure of the film is a series of anecdotes (Radio Days Broadway Danny Rose) set in the 30s (Zelig Purple Rose Bullets over Broadway) about a low-life (Deconstructing Harry) who believes being a genius absolves him from being a jerk (ditto). Given this film and Deconstructing Harry one wonders if this is Allens justification for his own actions with Mia Farrows adopted daughter; yes I was a jerk but Im a genius so you gotta love me.<br /><br /> Allen has only produced two good movies in the past ten years; the fine but overpraised Bullets over Broadway and the excellent but largely ignored Manhattan Murder Mystery. His other efforts range from trifles (New York Stories Mighty Aphrodite) to edgy yet experimental (Husbands and Wives) to pure drek (Alice Scenes from a Mall Shadows and Fog Celebrity Deconstructing Harry). His films no longer even try to have a narrative arc and his humor seems to aim at wryly amusing not funny. After Deconstructing Harry I stopped seeing his films in theaters; after Sweet and Lowdown I may stop renting them as well.',neg
'Chances Are a big mistake to see. You could know director Emile Ardolino from Dirty Dancing and Sister Act and should expect something amusing from him. But I guess I have to disillusion you. He made a really really bad movie.<br /><br />According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to reburn as a baby. The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr and Jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated huh?).<br /><br />They fall in love with each other. Then appears Jr former wife Cybill Shepherd and Jr falls in love with her too. I guess I dont even have to mention that she loves Ryan ONeil.<br /><br />In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jrs on his worst. He copies Michael J Fox.<br /><br />After the Moonlighting Shepherd proves that shes not suitable for acting in movies.<br /><br />Anyway theres one thing this unfunny comedy can be used: as antidote to insomnia.',neg
'I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling Gentleman Jim the best boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick Somebody Up There Likes Me. That movie might be number 1 but Gentleman Jim is a close number 2.<br /><br />The movie doesnt just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more gentlemanly days of the gloved Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.<br /><br />Gentleman Jim is not a realistic look at those days. It is romanticized and yes even a bit hokey at times. But always delightfully so. Errol Flynn is perfect as the Gentleman Jim who really isnt a gentleman at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is of course love that will win that match in the end).<br /><br />At the end of Gentleman Jim the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT I can lick any man in the world of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey if you want realism watch Raging Bull instead. That is a much more realistic boxing movie. But Gentleman Jim is a lot more fun.',pos

'I dont understand this movies distinctly average rating!?<br /><br />I really really enjoyed it i even stayed up till early morning to finish watching it on late night t.v<br /><br />There are three excellent characters here excellent characters. Danny DeVito played a gem quite a feat considering he was directing as well. His down trodden laughable at times character was brilliantly written and was surreal in a absolutely believable way. There ARE people like that Owen was just on the line without crossing it.<br /><br />Billy Crystals comic syle and sense of timing was PERFECT for his role. His frustration/comedy was interesting and captivating and whats more... you could understand his feelings. To really feel like you know a character is hard to achieve from the writers point of view to find the right actor to pull it off is an art in itself and both were achieved here thrice over.<br /><br />Thirdly who else could have played Momma? There is no one that can play this part so well. There is a style there unlike any other something you love to watch i found myself waiting for her to appear on screen... and not because the rest was bad oh no but because Mommas character was again so on the line without crossing it that it was excellent to watch.<br /><br />And whats more? A happy ending with new found friendships no one getting hurt and everyone getting what they wanted in life... WITHOUT a big hunk of cheese tied on the end.<br /><br />Brilliant script brilliant idea perfect cast great film.',pos
'I am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on Stephen Kings books - this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable.<br /><br />I have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and I still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary.<br /><br />The scene where Gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out.

'This Hamlet made for one of the boringest MST3000 episodes ever. I am not a Shakespear fan but I do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab. It is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many Hamlets listed. Like I said though this one is quite boring. It is in black and white the pacing is slow and there is minimal scenery. The actors are all dubbed too so that doesnt help. This is the one MST 3000 I cant watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing Hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep.',neg
'Ive watched this movie twice now on DVD and both times it didnt fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude. It seems more like a depiction of reality than most other Hollywood fare especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed. Even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint it doesnt fail to question it and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost not matter what and cruelty is a common denominator.<br /><br />What really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over-dramatize. Nowadays truly good movies (in a nutshell) are few and far apart with mainstream fare being enjoyable (if you dont have high expectations) but terribly commercially spirited. I think this movie comes off as a truly good movie (without being a masterpiece) because it sticks to itself and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence. This movie is cool observant and generally light-handed in its judgement which is GOOD.<br /><br />The story has its flaws especially Jewels Character comes off doubtfully but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life even by liberally taking each next guy. Still she doesnt come off as weak in fact I think shes one of the stronger characters shes always in control of the relationships with the men just tagging. And I take it very gratefully that shes not a weeping widow. I believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now. You could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries so the prospect of of someone dying while surely causing grief didnt traumatise people like it does now. People didnt seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now and I like that attitude.<br /><br />My recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare. Dont watch if if you want non-stop action or heart-renting emotion.',pos
'I saw El Mar yesterday and thought it to be a great movie. It starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: Ramallo Manuel Tur and Francisca. After that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet again.<br /><br />Religion sickness love violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tension-filled movie.<br /><br />I see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story. Its a violent intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. To cry. To get hurt. To bleed. And i think that what the film shows isnt done for pure shock-value or presented in a distasteful way. I know that some people like their films clean even those with violence in it. But sometimes a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work. This is one of those movies. And a great movie it is.<br /><br />The only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details werent 100\% clear and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie it all made sense. But it wasnt anything of much importance to the overall story so i still give this movie a 9.',pos
'I love these awful 80s summer camp movies. The best part about Party Camp is the fact that it literally has no plot. It simply drops a weak batch of characters into a location and then things occasionally happen. The cliches here are limitless (SPOILERS): the nerds vs. the jocks the secret camera in the girls locker room the hikers happening upon a nudist colony the contest at the conclusion the secretly horny camp administrators and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout. The only cliche missing is the presence of Corey Feldman. This movie will make you laugh but never intentionally. I repeat NEVER. A final note be prepared to bust a gut watching the nonsense that is the dramatic scene where Jerry Riviera and D.A. share a beer late at night spilling their guts to each other. The dialogue literally makes no sense and the acting belongs on a high-school stage. Its a classic.',neg
'Had this movie been made just a few years later I would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor. At times the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in-between-scenes (normal ambient sounds are missing). But given it was 1931 and a French movie this is quite forgivable. Especially since this also occurs in later French films--by which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely (such as in LAtalante from 1934).<br /><br />Okay apart from some minor sound problems this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you cant help but like. A nice charming film all-in-all.',pos

'This movie has everything. Emotion power affection Stephane Rideaus adorable naked beach dance... It exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesnt mean there isnt quite useful insight for anybody in it. I would probably classify it as a gay movie but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieus incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society doesnt encourage us to act any differently and that is what engenders the discord between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must-see!!!!',pos
'Sometimes I think that somewhere in the Lifetime Channels office complex there is a room where the writers hang-out with a large wheel on the wall - sort of like the Big Six ones in casinos. The latter have a lot of spots where you win even money and fewer for higher amounts until there are perhaps a couple which pay bigger bucks.<br /><br />But I picture the channels wheel having about six different genres on its wheel with two of them appearing the most labeled The Psychotic Neighbor or The Spouse with a Hidden Past or Secret or Both. Lifetime movies have a few repetitive story lines and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous.<br /><br />The Spouse... category can have a spouse of long-standing but some person appears or an event occurs exposing that the good wife was once a hooker one of the couple was involved in some nefarious act long ago or that something else in one of the background in different than presumed -- etc. etc. or as in this flick one of them has entered the marriage with the most nefarious of aims.<br /><br />One constant in all of their genres is that the husband or other males are usually clueless vacuous and slow to have any idea what in the hell is going until the climax or at best very late in the proceedings (unless the male is the miscreant). Not the case here.<br /><br />Whether the referenced miscreant might be the neighbor or as in this offering the wife it is always fascinating how easily successfully and effortlessly they proceed with their dastardly deeds. They manipulate many of the others whack them as necessary assume various poses and juggle more deceptions than you can count - with unfailing success until just before the end.<br /><br />The lead actor here like many in this channels movies is an old hand. I noticed that another film in which he starred was titled The Perfect Neighbor.<br /><br />Finally the vengeful perfect wife in this flick dispatches those in her path with more expertise and ease than the most experienced and competent button man in Don Corleones family could muster. And I couldnt help but imagine that Jack Nocholsons Melvin Udall character fro As Good As It Gets with his massive OCD affliction could provide counsel to the anti-heroine to assist in dealing with he obsession which was the basis of this opus.',neg
'Yes this review may contain spoilers but youll thank me for it. This is the worst film Ive seen in quite some time. I came to this board expecting to see the same response I had but inexplicably there are several people who love this film and Spaceys performance in particular.<br /><br />Some will chastise me for saying it but I find Kevin Spaceys acting quite limited despite the worlds admiration for him. I felt like I was watching a meaner version of Kevins American Beauty role. His character in this film is ridiculously overacted all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistant.<br /><br />There are all-world trite and boring scenes like when Spacey is tearing into Whaley about bringing him Equal instead of Sweat and Low. Somehow I suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny but by this time I was ready to hit the stop button (this is approximately 20 minutes into the film).<br /><br />What about the faux-homage to Resevoir Dogs? Whaley proclaims I think I saw this in a movie once as if hes going to cut off Spaceys ear. But what does he use to cut him? An envelope! Thats right hes going to give him paper cuts! That has to be one of Hollywoods all-time worst scenes and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling.<br /><br />I will admit that I didnt see the end of this film (my DVD mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end) but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that I missed a great twist and everything would have made sense. Well I dont care what happened in the end because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue. I even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as I did.',neg

'The entire movie an artful adaptation of one of Joyces Dubliners stories takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany) 1906. Most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters (two sisters and their niece) where a group of upper-class Dubliners gather for an evening of music recitations and dinner. While there is very little plot per se the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about Dublin in the early 20th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning. The cast all talented Irish stage actors with the exception of Anjelica Huston are universally wonderful and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself. The poignant final scene between Ms. Huston and the amazing Donal McCann reveals much about the marriage of the characters. There is poignancy mixed with humor and insight and for those who like quiet thoughtful movies The Dead is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every January 6th. After many viewings it never fails to move me and each time I glean something that Ive missed before.',pos
'This television show is stereotypical and far-fetched in many of its aspects.<br /><br />First of all the setting. All of the characters attend PCA this unbelievable boarding school with painted stylish dorms. The campus seems to have no reasonable rules - for instance the boys are often seen in the girls dormitories and vice versa. But this may be simply because the dorm adviser a silly character that basically bores the viewer instead of amusing them as I assume her purpose is supposed to be sits around and does nothing. I have friends in boarding schools and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show.<br /><br />Next the characters. I was so disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon wasnt creative at all with the personalities in this show. They all represent on characteristic which is exaggerated to the extreme: Zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she does (looks grades sports guys judgment creativity etc) Michael is the jock Logan is the arrogant jerk who basically does nothing aside from aggravate all the characters as well as us poor viewers Nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straight-As Dana was the tough girl Quinn is the unrealistic smart kid whom they consistently make fun of Chase is the guy who is afraid of confessing his true feelings which really aggravates me as the show continues and that new girl- Lola or something- is just another clone of Nicole.<br /><br />The main two characters that aggravate me the most are Zoey and Quinn. First of all I just do not understand Zoeys character. She was obviously created to be the perfect character as I said above but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them- in most of the episodes she creates a problem then has to fix it. Whats frustrating is that we are supposed to love her and think she is amazing when they havent even created a very realistic character to begin with.<br /><br />Quinn on the other hand bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point at which her character is absolutely insulting. The impression I get from Nick concerning her character is that geeks and nerds are people to laugh at to criticize to mock. In the spring break episode they did a year ago they introduced two more nerds who the characters had to make cool. I found this highly offensive and stereotypical. What kind of message is Nick sending to these kids? Is it: Dont do well in school dont get good grades dont study hard- youll end up being a geek and we will mock your profession in future television series! Because that is definitely the message I get from these poorly constructed characters and it is an awful message through and through.<br /><br />All I can do is hope that Nick one day realizes that by putting down the intelligent folks in our world they are not doing anyone any good.',neg

'From 2002 on Dutch cinema finally got better again. This movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of the bad period of Dutch cinema.<br /><br />The story is needlessly told in flashback style. All of the present sequences set in France are completely redundant and add nothing to the story emotions or power. For some reason European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not chronological. I never understood why or what the appeal of it is.<br /><br />The story self also isnt exactly the greatest. It isnt always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell. The story of a young unexperienced boy falling in love with a wild young girl who later turns out to be quite psychotic might sound good enough on paper and even shows some parallels to Paul Verhoevens Turks fruit to which this movie often was compared to before and at the time of its release. However the end result is far from comparable. The story fails to capture the right emotions which is also due to the unimaginative performances from the actors. The way the story is told also makes the movie far from always interesting or compelling. I lost interest for this movie at about 40 minutes through the movie.<br /><br />At the time this movie was made both Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf were promising rising stars with great potential and ambitions but both their careers have pretty much dried up by now. Angela Schijf seems to give her family more attention than her career (that is not a bad thing of course) while Antonie Kamerling tried to start a career in Hollywood. He never got any further than playing some small bit parts in 2 Renny Harlin flops. To be honest Im not surprised. Its not that he is a bad actor and he certainly has got the right looks but his English just isnt good enough to put it mildly. Just listen to him speaking English in the beginning of this movie and youll understand what I mean. They are really not bad actors but for some reason it doesnt show in this movie. Its probably also due to the poor dialog. I still kind of liked Beau van Erven Dorens. Hes been criticized a lot but his acting seems very natural. He always keeps the characters close to who he self is.<br /><br />It by no means is one of the worst movies ever made but its not exactly one I would recommend either. Bad and uninteresting storytelling makes this a bad movie.<br /><br />4/10',neg
'78 years ago...the premiere of Anna Christie advertised by the slogan Garbo Talks! The film runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the climax of curiosity: Greta enters the bar and gets through a long awaited transfer from silence into sound: a few seconds closing her silent era and at last Greta Garbo says a historic line: Gimme a whiskey ginger ale on the side and dont be stingy baby! <br /><br />Anna Christie (1930) is the movie by Clarence Brown that introduced a great silent star Greta Garbo to talkies. Nowadays we can only imagine what serious transfer it was for actors and actresses. The careers of many were bound to end - something we hardly or not at all see at present. And it was no coincidence that it was Clarence Brown who directed the first talkie with the Swedish beauty. Garbo trusted the director after two of his great silent productions FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) and A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS (1928): movies that achieved a smashing success at the box office both with Garbo in the lead. <br /><br />But we are in 2008 and that fact about the movie now purely historical appears to be of minor importance. The question for todays viewer is not what Garbos voice sounds like but if the movie is still watchable after these 78 years. In other words we all strive to answer the question if the movie has stood a test of time. Has it?<br /><br />When I recently watched it I came into conclusion that except for some minor technical aspects including static camera Anna Christie is still very entertaining. Its on the one hand a wonderful story of a life of a reality that the young woman faces (being based on Eugene ONeills play) and on the other hand an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of direction and acting. Let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs.<br /><br />CONTENT: Chris Christopherson (George F Marion) a heavy drinker lives a life of a sailor on a barge. Although his days are filled with sorrows he is consoled by a letter from his daughter Anna (Garbo) whom he hasnt seen for 15 years. She says that she will come back to him. He starts to change everything for better; however forgets that his daughter is no longer a child lacking experience but a 23 year-old woman who has got through various sorts of things on a farm in Minnessota where she lived and worked. Moreover he forgets that she has a right to accept another kind of male love in her life... This brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main character but the one which is introduced to us sooner than Anna (her father Chris) makes you realize how universal it is. Simply no letter from the whole text that life appears to be has been erased after all these years. Cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid...<br /><br />PERFORMANCES. There are not many characters in the movie but there are two that really shine in the roles. It is of course Greta Garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her 15 year-long phenomenon the presence that strongly marked the history of early cinema (something I have already discussed in many of my earlier comments on her films). But here Garbo is slightly different. I admit that there are moments in this movie when she does not feel very comfortable with her role. That seems to be caused by her new experience with sound in English; however her performance is as always genuine and unique. But that is what everyone has expected from Garbo. The true surprise of the movie for the 1930 viewers and also for us is Marie Dressler as Marthy. She is excellent in her facial expressions in her accent in the entire portrayal of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of hitting the bottle. Her best moments include the conversation with Anna Christie in the bar preceded by her hilarious talk with Chris. The rest of the supporting cast are fine yet not great whatsoever (here the German version makes up for it). Particularly Dressler except for Garbo herself constitutes an absolutely flawless choice.<br /><br />If you asked me what I like about Anna Christie nowadays thats what I would tell you: its a classic movie. However there is one more thing that I must mention at the end. It is humor wonderful wit that is noticeable throughout. Although the content is quite serious and Anna Christie in no way carries a comedian spirit (the only Garbos comedy was NINOTCHKA) there are such moments when you will split your sides. Dont skip for instance Anna and Matts visit in the fun park particularly at the restaurant where he orders milk for her thinking how virtuous and innocent she is beer for himself and where suddenly Marthy joins them by chance...<br /><br />Anna Christie is a perfect movie for classic buffs and a must see for all at least a bit interested in the true magnificence of performance. If you are fed up with many of those modern starlets seek such movies out and you shall be satisfied. Very worth your search! <br /><br />Skaal Greta Garbo! Skaal Marie Dressler! Let us drink a toast to the great jobs you did in the movie! Skaal after all these years when wine tastes much better and your spirits are with us in a different sense...',pos
'I have just finished watching this film and I can honestly say that this is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2.<br /><br />Not only does Guy bring together a b list(ish) movie cast and make them into such glorious characters he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination.<br /><br />Far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate...yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable.<br /><br />This film is special.

'Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the worlds great directors. This sensitive visually beautiful film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures well that writers dark irony. John Turturro gives what I consider to be his finest performance (I am usually not a fan of his); and Emily Watson is brilliant as well. Well worth seeing.',pos
'Three flash-backs introduce the main characters (Abu Jaffar and the Princess) who will interact with Ahmad; three are the songs each linked to those same characters. Three times does Ahmad pronounce the absolute word Time in his declaration of love to the Princess answering her three questions at their first of three meetings. So strong is the impression he causes that the Princess will resist the three attempts by Jaffar to conquer her - by three successive ploys: deceit hypnosis and memory erasing. Yet Jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman: the whip the power and the sword. Three is the number of flying entities: the mechanical-horse the Genie and the The Genie and the magic carpet. The Genie offers three wishes to Abu at their first of three encounters; three times does the Genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges and three are his considerations about human frailty before he departs. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn (armed guards giant-spider and giant-octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu the future the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save Ahmad and the Princess and the bow-and-arrow to execute Jaffar. Theres magic in the number three and there is magic in this movie.',pos
'I dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy. Meanwhile Gene Kelly falls for lovely damsel Leslie Caron. His main dancing partner and I must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise. Famous French singer Georges Guietary sings too. So if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with Oscar Levants nimble piano fingers the songs of George Gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem. 8/10',pos
'I thought this would be a sequel to the original 36th Chamber of Shaolin but actually its more of a light-hearted sister to the original. Gordon Liu still stars as a would-be hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those pesky Manchus... but this time around its lighter and more comedic. The film centres around the local dye mill where wages are cut due to the hiring of 10 new Manchurian bosses. Liu plays Chao who is able to fool the mill bosses into thinking he is a shaolin monk possessing almost magical kung fu skill. But his luck runs out he is exposed as a fraud and he promises the mill workers that he will go to the Shaolin monastery to learn kung fu and return to protect them.<br /><br />The comedy really begins at the monastery where Chao makes several bungling attempts to get accepted. This sets up lots of really funny moments and lots of great fight choreography. Continuing in the 36th Chamber tradition we see all kinds of neat and interesting (and supremely hokey) training methods at the monastery as well as creative uses of wooden benches as weapons.<br /><br />Also unique and of note is the blending of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold building. Chao is not accepted as a student at Shaolin but is made to build bamboo scaffolding for the 10 year restoration of the monastery. On the DVD I bought there is a special on bamboo scaffold building and the inspiration that director Lau Kar-Leung drew from it. This is a craft many hundreds (perhaps thousands) of years old and in Hong Kong scaffolding is still built of bamboo even on large high-rises though the West exclusively uses steel tubes and clamps. As a result of his scaffolding work Chao develops a special style of kung fu... when asked what kind it is he hilariously replies scaffolding kung fu!! which he first tests during a dust-up with the monasterys Abbot. In the final confrontation with the Manchus there is a dazzling array of creative uses for bamboo poles and ties.<br /><br />From a comedy perspective I think its one of the best of the kung fu genre. As a kung fu film in general it also stands out... I recommend it to anyone!',pos
'Chokher Bali  A passion play.<br /><br />Based on Rabindranath Tagores novel of the same name this is a classic tale of deception adultery and relationship exploitation. Set in 1900 Bengal director Rituparno Ghosh transformed the Nobel Laureates acclaimed literature into a delightful visual treat.<br /><br />Tagores story elaborately deals with the Bengali society through his central character the rebellious widow who wants to live a life of her own. We are taken into the picturesque part of Bengal where we meet our heroine the beautiful young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai).<br /><br />Despite her gorgeous looks two handsome men the rich Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji) and his friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury) denied marrying her.<br /><br />Mahindra chooses a naive Ashalata (Raima Sen) over Binodini and marries her. Leaving behind the country life the free-spirited Binodini accompanies Mahindras mother to Calcutta as a caretaker. Soon her friendship with Ashalata flourishes. It looks like the two addressing each other as Chokher Bali (sand in the eyes) share an enduring bond. The English-speaking Binodini captures a special place in the house. But soon she unmasks her real face. Manipulating good-natured Ashlata Binodini gets closer with Mahindra and fulfills her sexual desires.<br /><br />When she is thrown out by the enraged mother of Mahindra Binodini seeks solace from a reluctant Behari. The remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters crisscross and culminate in an unimaginable climax Aishwarya walks through the rolea manipulative rebellious lady still gaining the viewers sympathywith a ballet dancers elegance. The other lead artistesProsenjit Chatterjee Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhuryare equally brilliant in enacting their characters.<br /><br />While Tagore penned this mould-breaking story at the turn of the 20th century the very idea of widow marriage was a taboo even among the upper class! Narrating the nations freedom movement in parallel the author asserts the importance of individual freedom from the caged life. Kudos to the art director who gave life to the early 20th century Bengal and applause to the cinematographer for capturing those sets with verve.<br /><br />This passion play by Tagore has been fervently converted to the screen by the ablest filmmaker without loosing its originality.',pos
'I accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels. I immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast groovy haircuts aside and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars? Having not seen the original I guessed it might be the Poseidon Adventure since it was obviously on a ship in distress. Was I wrong! I cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash. There is no story the performances all looked forced the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy.<br /><br />It is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as Sally Field Michael Caine et al. They must have needed the money badly. Can we blame the director?',neg

It didnt have any bloopers or any exciting parts like their other movies.',neg
'Boring predictable by-the-numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of (mindless) mayhem and gore to satisfy (mindless) genre fans. Mostly its about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we dont care an iota about - if thats your thing tune in. (*1/2)',neg
'If there was some weird inversed Oscar Academy awards festival this flick would win it all. It has all the gods excellent plot extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar. Well this could be the scenario if the world was inversed but its not. Instead its the worst horror flick ever made not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia but also extremely low on special effects. For example the devil costume (which by the way is a must-see) is something of the most hilarious Ive ever seen. Whenever I saw that red-black so called monster on screen I couldnt hold my laugh back. And to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor-belt.<br /><br />Do not do the same mistake as I did. Checking IMDB seeing that the movie was released in 2003 had less than five votes and thinking: -Well its worth a shot cant be that bad.<br /><br />Yes it could.<br /><br />Im not even going to waste more words on this movie.',neg
'Jerry Angell owner of zombie-horrors finest mullet returns for more undead action in the sequel to director Todd Sheets atrocious home-made gore-fest Zombie Bloodbath. This time around Jerry plays a sleazy low-life thug who along with his equally despicable partner-in-crime some escaped convicts several teenagers and a bunch of screaming girls comes face-to-face with a horde of shambling flesh-eating corpses.<br /><br />Obviously having learnt zilch about improving his craft in the two years since Zombie Bloodbath Sheets delivers another shoddy mess of a film that somehow manages to be even worse than the originala feat that I thought was almost impossible to achieve. The acting is uniformly lousy the effects amateurish and cheap (most of the gore appears to be nothing more than a selection of offcuts offal and blood from the local butchers shop) the story incomprehensible (as far as I could fathom the zombies rise from the dead because a scarecrow commands them to!!!) and the direction frustratingly laden with cheap looking video effects and completely meaningless cuts to black-and-white.<br /><br />And as if that wasnt enough to convince you of this films complete lack of redeeming features the simply mind-bogglingly moronic ending should do the trick: the few remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently happens to have a stash of flesh-eating bacteria laying on its passenger seatjust the thing for dissolving the undead (but strangely enough not at all detrimental to the living).',neg
'What about Scream Baby Scream is supposed to make me not feel like a fool for buying it? I bought it because God help me Im a sucker for old B-cinema even as worthless as this. Nonetheless Something about this movie irritates me its probably Janet Janet comes off cold & snooty seemingly with the intention of coming off as deep and noble with a look on her face that screams constipation she cant seem to agree to anything her uptight boyfriend wants. Im glad that this is her only role. What really irritates me is that this is a 1960s gore film gone terribly awry and as we all know awry is Floridian for zero gore. Its like the director started with a Herschell Lewis style but backed out of the gore scenes when his wife found out so instead we end up with one dull conversation after the other and basically a whole lot of irritating nothing. In other words we end up with Florida Bore. Joseph Adler should be embarrassed. Janets boyfriend Jason is almost as ridiculous as she is this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything come to think of it hes probably the least likable good guy in horror history. The only thing this movie really has going for it is that it carries that 60s/early 70s B-gore vibe that you can find in stuff like Undertaker & his pals Blood Freak or most anything from Herschell Lewis. Even Rodney from the Gruesome Twosome is in this I Ithought his caveman comedy routine was irritating most everything from reel to reel is stupid even the trip scene was stupid. The only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery but that mostly includes Janet whining about life not being perfect. In the only real ironic twist Scream Baby Scream gets even less interesting once the story finally gets started around the 45 minute mark. If you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable but are offended by the color red you might not hate this. Why does Troma distribute this? Wouldnt this be Something Weird Videos area? Scream Baby Scream very well may be the worst in Florida horror/gore of its era but I suppose underneath the unlikeable characters and the incoherent plot lies potential. Scream Baby Scream really just seems like it should follow the Blood Feast pattern so to steal a quote from Janet If it doesnt fit I throw it out. 2/10',neg
'`Its as if this town has the power to suck your brain right out of your head. -Patti<br /><br />Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenaged girl bored with her all-too-average little town. Bored that is until a woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes to be clues to the poor ladys whereabouts. Now with the help of her precious cat `D.C. and an inept FBI agent (Doug E. Doug) she must find her.<br /><br />That Darn Cat is a bad movie. It is quite foolish and it has humor that often falls quite flat. There are however a few buds of talent in it. Doug E. Doug was good in Cool Runnings. His performance as `Senga was really funny. Here he is wasted as the bumbling FBI agent. He does have a good scene when he imitates the cat though. Micheal Mckean plays Pattis father. His character must be the most understanding parent to ever live. This poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed gets arrested for picking up his own cat and gets bitched-at by his snippy wife and STILL doesnt get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles. I wish my old man was like that. The only real good performance is Christina Riccis. She entertaining as the ever-annoyed Patti but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down. You might also recognize Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein Everybody Loves Raymond) the old lady from Wings and Cliff from Cheers in this movie. This is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget. Even the cat isnt very good... I really cant recommend 1997s That Darn Cat. Some young children (under 8) might enjoy it a bit but every one else should look elsewhere. If youre looking for a good Christina Ricci movie I suggest Addams Family Values The Opposite of Sex or Sleepy Hollow. If a fun family film is what youre after try Snow Day instead.<br /><br />',neg
'<br /><br />I understand that people have different expectations of low-budget arthouse movies. I also know that John Sayles has a sort of glow about him that earthy intellectual anti-hollywood vibe a la Tim Robbins the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan that makes him a darling with the critics from the get-go.<br /><br />But this is not a good movie. Im sorry it just isnt.<br /><br />It meanders. It has too many characters. Its tone is uneven its point of view is muddled the acting is all over the board from naturalistic to over the top. It lingers for long moments with minor characters we dont care about and cuts away from tense scenes just when things are getting good.<br /><br />It misses the mark.<br /><br />The worst flaw in the movie is that the two closest things to a protagonist Edie Falcos Marly and Angela Bassetts Desiree are straight-jacketed in characters that have no drive. Marly is an apathetic drunk steeped in her lifes own inertia. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own repressed pain. When your two main characters world-views can be summed up with the phrases I dont care and I want to leave here why should the audience give a rats patootie?<br /><br />Ill be plain: Sayles writes funny dialogue. Hes very adept at crafting a scene. The problem is these scenes dont go anywhere. Theres no spine to the movie. No drive. The movie doesnt create rooting interest in any of the characters. In my opinion hes also too preachy about big bad corporate America gobbling up the little guy. <br /><br />If you want to see a quality small movie see David Lynchs Straight Story. Pass this one up.',neg
'Son of the Mask is a terrible excuse of a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we had seen Because of Winn-Dixie instead. I must say that it is partially my fault as I agreed to go see it with him. Being a fan of the first Mask movie (Jim Carrey was hilarious) I had hoped it wasnt as bad as all of the critics said it was.<br /><br />Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was headed for disaster. Disgusting and pointless attempts at being funny got little seven and eight year old children shrieking with laughter but the rest of us were left staring at the screen in disbelief.<br /><br />Finding the movie as repulsive and unfunny as I did is surprising to even me as I loved Scary Movie and Anchorman two films which many people I know found crude and offensive. But the thing is Son of the Mask is not funny unless youre under the age of ten.<br /><br />The film features lots of CGI in it but it cannot save this piece of rubbish. Whoever allowed this movie to make it to the big screen was probably thinking it had potential considering the success of its original. Unfortunately it has none of the laughs fun or excitement of the first creating a mockery of the original movie. I recommend renting the original Mask to anyone who is thinking about seeing this one. 1 star out of 10 is generous to this awful mess.',neg
'I caught this during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater. Despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy namely the beating death of Eddie Polec in 1994) I really have to come down hard on this movie. The director for reasons best known to himself decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. Such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material which makes up the majority of the film. A stroll down the sidewalk a brother-to-brother discussion on a sofa hell even a kiss on a first-date are all shot cusinart-style distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama. Martin also undercuts his narrative by packing in far too many topics: besides the birth of mob violence we get anorexia alcoholism divorce racism parental abuse...did I miss anything? No doubt a better cast (and a better-focused direction) would have knit these threads together as Martin surely intended to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and sustains a host of others...but good intentions do not necessarily a great film make. Just a sprawling mess. Martin I know youre from my town and Im down with you man I really am...just do a better job next time like you did in Two Plus One.',neg
'This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you. I found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability this was represented in a great performance by both two Michael and Rory. Whether the story is based around a true story I feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human. On the whole this film reach into my soul and I too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity. The whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but I feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama. Certainly one not to be missed!',pos
'As soon as I saw the ad for Changi on the History Channel I knew Id love it. It captured the ANZAC spirit fantastically - you would die if you didnt have mates around you. The characters of Changi were strong and each brought something different into the story and the Japanese soldiers werent criticised but were depicted as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right just as the Australians were doing. Direction screenplay acting and setting were all done wonderfully with a clear easy-to-follow plot. Humour was the soldiers key to survival and it was great to see a mini-series about war actually have some sort of humour in it which is usually difficult to do without offending people. From what Ive read about soldiers in Changi PoW camp this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years those Australian British New Zealand American and Dutch men spent there. I would recommend this series to anyone whether you are interested in war or not. 10/10.',pos

By the end of the movie Myia not only deflowers but give poor innocent and naive Trent a lesson in how to spot a dangerous nut job and keep as far away for him or herin order to keep from ending up turning into one. <br /><br />Hanging around a trucker rest-stop Miya is picked up by Roy Burt Young for some hot and heavy action in the back seat of his buggy. Roy is either too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is non other then his estranged daughter! Outraged that Miya is reluctant to get it on with him Roy almost strangles her to death only to be interrupted by first year collage student Trent Colbert who plows into the rest-area side swiping one of the truckers. <br /><br />Seeing her chance Miya jumps into Trents car and the two are off in what turns out to be the weirdest car chase ever put into a movie. Going all across the North Eastern USA the two end up involved in a truck car smash-up a murder and a shootout with the state troopers that then leads to Trents parents home with them being held hostage. Its there that theres another wild shootout between the crazed Miya with an entire SWAT team reinforced by the local police and state troopers. <br /><br />You would expect a movie like Hit and Run to be intentionally or unintentionally funny but its not. In fact the film is very disturbing in how Miya treats everyone in the film that she comes in contact with even her perverted and child-molesting father Roy. Getting Trent to drive her all over the North-East Miya gets the poor slob drunk having it on with him in a motel room together with whips handcuffs and a lighted candle. Miya also gets it on with the motel owner the horny Mr. Foster by tricking him into giving her his gun as being part of some weird sex game. After holding Foster up she takes off with Trents who out cold in his motel room wallet with some $400.00 in it yet doesnt bother to drive away with his car. <br /><br />Needing the money to pay for gas to get home to his parents for Thanksgiving Trent gets a call on his cellphone from Miya to pick her up at a local diner to get his money back. Like the jerk that he is Trent picks up Miya whos now a fugitive from he law and later gets involved with her father Roy on the open highway as he tries to run both Trent & Miya off the road. <br /><br />The chase ends up in this deserted wear-house that Roy chases Miyaout running him on a muddy road in high-heels into with him getting it in the you know where with a blast from his own shotgun. Roy was so busy trying to take his pants off that he forgot he left the gun unattended. <br /><br />With both a holdup and murder as well as a hit and run charge against them the two desperadoes stop off at a S&M/Tattoo boutique where Trent gets his ear and nose pierced and is dressed up in leather and chains by Myri together with a matching his and hers dog collar. This in order to meet his straight-laced and conservative parents for Thanksgiving Dinner. <br /><br />Having a running shootout with the state troopers with one of them ending up badly injuredthe two fugitives from the law end up at Trents parents Mr & Mrs Colbet David Keith & Elaine Martyn home with the entire local police force with a SWAT team waiting for them there. <br /><br />Obnoxious movie with a truly disturbing final ending that made you wonder what exactly the movie was tryingif at all to tell its audience. You felt a lot of sympathy for Miya at first but as the movie rolled along to its downbeat ending that evaporated as fast as a tray of ice cubs in Death Valley. Even though Roy was the most unlikable person in the movie at first by the time the film ended Miya totally eclipsed him.',neg
'In his first go as a Hollywood director Henry Brommell whips an enthralling yarn that is all of penetrating relatable marital issues with melancholic authenticity and lacing such with an equally absorbing subplot of a father-son hit-man business. The film is directed astutely and consists of a wonderfully put together cast as well as a swift family-conscious screenplay (also by Brommell) that brings life to an otherwise fatigued genre. As a bonus Panic delivers subtle acerbic humoran unexpected undeniably charming and very welcome surprisethrough its bumbling unsure-of-himself low-key star whose ever-cool state is enticing especially given his line of work.<br /><br />The forever-great William H. Macy again captures our hearts as Alex a unhappy torn middle-aged husband and father who finds solace in the most dubious of persons: a young attractive equally-messed-up 23-year-old named Sarah (Neve Campbell) whom he meets in the waiting-room at a psychologists office where he awaits the therapy of Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) to discuss his growing eagerness to quit the family business that his father (Donald Sutherland) built. Alex whose lust to lead a new life is obstructed by the fear of disappointing his dictating father strikes an unwise fancy for Sarah which ultimately leads him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being a husband to his wife and more importantly to him a good father to his six-year-old son Sammy (played enthusiastically by the endearing David Dorfman).<br /><br />Henry Brommells brilliant Panic is something of a rarity in Hollywood seldom seen (with the exception of 2002s Road to Perdition) since its conception in 2000it weaves two conflicting genres (organized-crime family drama) into a fascinating warm hunk of movie-viewing that is evenly strong in either directionand its one that will maintain its exceptional infrequent caliber and gleaming sincerity for ages to come.',pos
'I watched the movie in a preview and I really loved it. The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious. Another highlight of the movie is definitely the music which hopefully will be released soon. I recommend it to everyone who likes the British humour and especially to all musicians. Go and see. Its great.',pos
'I cant imagine why it hasnt been theatrically released yet. Its got a great ensemble cast with Sutherland Lane and especially Chris Evans doing spectacular work. Wake up studio execs!<br /><br />The story is based upon the experiences of the author/screenwriter growing up as the poor kid in an extremely affluent community where class is everything and makes a difference in every aspect of life from clothing to justice.<br /><br />During the films Q&A the author was asked about his experiences and particularly what we dont know about the ultra-rich. He said they arent stupid theyre very smart (as opposed to how they may portray themselves) theyve got plans and they are a threat!<br /><br />In many ways this film is extremely timely.',pos
'This movie is all about entertainment. Imagine your friends that you love spending time with the ones that you know inside out becoming a bit silly and perhaps taking on a character or two. Thats what this film is about. An inventive script and brilliantly performed. Its not about pleasing the masses with this one its about having fun with a bunch of brilliantly talented people. Which is what Im sure they all thought when they signed up for it. <br /><br />The above review sounds completely unfair and I think that the person who wrote that was in the wrong frame of mind when they watched the film. In a lighthearted moment there is great dignity in it if you care to look.<br /><br />A job well done I thought it was a great film. Id watch this before the North American norm any day.<br /><br />In a nutshell its not the best film youre ever going to see but it has a hell of a lot of moments. I havent laughed that long in an age.',pos
'Just saw this at the cinema. I havent read the books. There is nothing new about this film at all. <br /><br />the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword he keeps on going looking the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close move fast and turn the music up......... This leaves me feeling conned yet again.<br /><br />I admire them for attempting to tackle a dark storyline without the normal Hollywood cheese but Im sorry to say the filmmakers have failed miserably. The characters are 2 dimensional. We hardly get to know them or feel for them at all. The lead has a charming farmers accent oo arrr..... though it seems he hasnt got much to say...<br /><br />Dont bother watching this unless you are bored and got it half price from blockbusters....',neg

'Love Rosario Dawson think shes one of the finest actresses of the modern era.<br /><br />Descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else. Its the consistent undertone in everything in the film. The dialog is flat the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided. The only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and Rosarios journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again.<br /><br />Pitching this as a rape classic isnt appropriate and thats probably why so many people dont enjoy the film. The standard rape audience wouldnt particularly like this film and maybe thats the point? The film asks more questions than it answers and it does confront its target audience whether they like it or not. Theres a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film doesnt slap the audience across the face with self-righteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Descent is a good film which IMHO is severely under-rated.',pos
'Like The Jeffersons Good Times was one of the those classic American sitcoms which was never aired in the UK not to mention it came out in the 1970s- a decade where of which I wasnt born yet.<br /><br />But like most fans of the show I watched a few episodes on You Tube- and afterwards I loved it.<br /><br />The Evans family are headed by James and Florida- two parents trying to make ends meet and who despite their lack of qualifications encourage their children who have their own aspirations in life to fulfil them and to take their chances. James was the strict but loving dad who didnt dare hesitate in disciplining J.J Michael and Thelma- should they over-step the line. Whilst Florida in contrast was a fair kind- hearted and considerate mother and loving wife although she was in many ways similar to James with regards to their attitudes to parenthood and family values from an Afro- American perspective.<br /><br />The kids were just as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves: J.J was an aspiring artist with a goofy personality and crazy sense of humour who would often wear multi-coloured outfits and whose DY-NO-MITE catchphrase is as infectious and familiar as Arnold Jacksons Whatchoo talking bout Willis? from Diffrent Strokes. Michael was the smart-alec who dreams of becoming a lawyer whilst sister Thelma had her own dreams and hopes. Her verbal taunts with J.J were mostly hilarious as was the love/hate relationship between brother and sister which was played out extremely well by both Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis.<br /><br />Over the seasons there were a few cameo appearances made most notably from Janet Jackson Debbie Allen and a young Gary Coleman as himself! I actually prefer Good Times over say The Cosby Show which was an 80s show because a) I preferred the Evans family over the Huxtables both in terms of a) characterisation and b)as I felt it tackled serious and difficult social issues in a way that resonated with many viewers. It was a comedy but it was also a social commentary which aimed to highlight the lives of working class Afro- Americans in 1970s America. The Cosby Show attempted to cater to the mainstream audience in a candy coated way as the Huxtables were portrayed as Blacks who easily assimilated themselves into an upper-class U.S culture we would associate Whites with whereas Good Times in contrast was much more edgier and it was not afraid to address themes such as drug and child abuse in a realistic way. I actually found that whilst The Cosby Show can be fun to watch at times it lacked that bit of sassiness which Good Times has and of which made it trendier and cooler.<br /><br />The show did jump the shark during the latter seasons as it continued after John Amoss character James died in a freak accident (in reality it was known at the time that John had quit Good Times for good. And so his characters death was written as it is on the show). Without John the show suffered and alas it lost a lot of its charm.<br /><br />Still for a sitcom Good Times ticked all the right boxes. If only they had shown this in the UK during the 80s. As it certainly is as JJ would put it DY-NO-MITE!! <br /><br />My rating: 8 and a half',pos
'Lily Mars a smalltown girl living in Indiana dreams of making it big on Broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice her but he just gets annoyed with her antics. When Thornway goes back to New York to stage his show Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show only as a favor to her family however Thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms which makes the shows leading lady Isabel Rekay jealous. When Isabel gets fed up with the John-Lily romance causing friction with the show she leaves and John decides to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play which also may jeopardize the romance. Very charming film and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comedic touches into her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth while supposed to be humorous never threatened her singing career) I enjoyed Heflins character (Thornway) more when he was annoyed with Lily rather than be the romantic. The film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes werent assembled that well together but a very enjoyable film. Rating 7.',pos
'Quirky vulnerable raw honest and a treat to watch. Im not here to give a summary or synopsis of the film. I simply wish to congratulate this small film with the GREAT BIG HEART. I tip my hat to the filmmaker and its excellent cast. If you want to know what happens in the film...then go see it. Michael Parness writer/director has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter  Suicide with great compassion comedy and empathy. I see a great career ahead for Mr. Parness. This film works. Right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with every movie we need to suspend some disbelief yet I found with MAX AND GRACE I was easily transported and completely convinced with its surreal moments. I only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further. Mr. Parness has pulled some wonderful performances from this already talented cast. For instance Guillermo Díaz performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving. The colossus Ralf Moeller former Mr Olympiad as a terrified patient...perfect. I can go on and on...This independent feature has the star power of a big budget Hollywood film however you forget about the STARS on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story. The real star here is the brilliant screenplay. I look forward to seeing more from Writer/Director Michael Parness.',pos
'*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br /><br />Great WrestleManias were still a few years away. But this one was certainly good with lots of good matches and one great match.<br /><br />Demolition was always at their best at WrestleMania. Im glad their last WM hoorah (I refuse to include the other version) was a win over the Colossal Connection. I liked the gag of Andre never tagging in.<br /><br />Few fans know that this was the first time anyone ever beat Mr. Perfect. For some reason Brutus Beefcakes feat was never recognized. Or the fact that he did it pretty easily.<br /><br />The Hart Foundations win over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM history including the 24/9 second match between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones.<br /><br />Im glad Jake and DiBiase got to fight at WrestleMania. This made up for the fact that the feud had to be put on hold for so long.<br /><br />I expected the Big Bossman-Akeem feud to heat up but the Bossman just clobbered him. As good as Bossman was as a heel he was just great as a face. He was always intense and obviously loved his job.<br /><br />If the Warrior just had a better work ethic and maybe tried to learn to wrestle he would have been a great WWF champion.<br /><br />Worth a watch especially since the boring matches are too short to complain about. And the tag team matches are all very exciting.',pos
'Even those of us who like cute animal pictures --- and I abhor them ---would be hard pressed to find any merit in this abysmally bad travesty of a film. Perhaps inspired by 101 Dalmatians with its smart and loyal dogs its dumb and devious humans and its absurdly happy and predictable ending the alternate title 101 Turkeys springs to mind. That would just about cover everyone involved in its unfortunate production. I dismissed it as some inane Hollywood perversion of British customs before learning to my horror that it actually is a Canadian film done in Victoria BC that phony British theme park of a town while sucking tax dollars out of Ottawa ON that equally phony pit of Canadian mediocrity. Let me count the ways it is bad. The dizzy plot? The asinine script? The dismal performances and sophomoric direction? The cloyingly clever animals? The endless clichés and predictable slapstick? On second thought neither I nor those browsing the IMDb have time for a complete catalogue of its failings. Yet were I to detail its merits this space would remain blank. Trust me it is bad; a signal monument in the vast pantheon of truly terrible (Canadian) cinema. If you have seen it already my condolences. If you have not stay away from it as you would SARS or bubonic plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Dont even let your children see it lest their tiny minds be warped by the even tinier minds of those who financed fabricated and filmed this frightful folly. Perhaps tonight when I retire I will have a nightmare with ghastly fanged beasts springing from the bed table as I flee in frantic flight. I hope so. It will be a far far better thing I do than watch this beastly banal boondoggle. But then I might dream that I had to watch it a second time and the sheer terror and cold sweat of that makes me want to stay up all night trembling at the very possibility of seeing it again even as a bad dream. I might even find something worthwhile to watch in its stead. Maybe Godzilla or Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes Perhaps the instruction video for my built in vacuum cleaner.',neg

'Theres a good story well hidden and never really used! <br /><br />The film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow character and story development have been forgotten.

'Director Mikhail Kalatozovs film The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli) is a glorious piece of cinema. From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov based on his own play Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home. Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable. However this Russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way; by telling us straight from a soldiers mouth how war is hated by all that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting we see a new vision of WWII. We have young men volunteering to wage war for peace to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they dont believe in. With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East and how people are dying for no reason against their will its nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are as well as those awaiting their return.<br /><br />Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl Veronika doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love. An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration. Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude. Whether this is all a glorified look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not I dont know. There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country it is all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday.<br /><br />The acting is top-notch throughout but some deserve singling out. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris grandmother. She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language. Vasili Merkuryev as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich brings what is perhaps the best performance. As spoken at the end about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments. He puts on a tough exterior especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave. But when Boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man seated in sorrow at the table. He loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him his actions throughout the film express it to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris a happy-go-lucky young man and idealist doing what he believes is right and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villainous Mark staying home due to his talented piano skills or maybe just to steal his cousins love. That love played by Tatyana Samojlova really draws the audience in to her grief dejection and slim glimmer of hope. The true star of the film she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way needing to steer back on course hoping that she did so soon enough for Boris return.<br /><br />Besides the realism to the story as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across I also loved the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevskys cinematography is amazing especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen. It is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do so in a square frame. Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water a bridge in the background at the top as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance. There are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are utilized as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together.<br /><br />The real feats however are those instances of the long shot. Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for Boris her own farewell needing to be said. The planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people the camera focuses on couples kisses people yelling to one another and more all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through. Everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. Its just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and mise en scène can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible. Composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do.',pos
'I could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable. The dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft-core porn. In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (Perhaps for sex as well but not on Indian TV anyway.)<br /><br />Not being a fan of the genre I couldnt place Jeff Wincott and had no leads to search from. Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II did I make the positive ID on her.<br /><br />This movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90s couture or nod-and-wink schlock à la Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for so-bad-its-good?',pos

'Fashionably fragmented yet infuriatingly half-realized character-study an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates: a talented but undisciplined star basketball player and a pot-smoking womanizing rabble-rouser. We never learn why these young men are friends. They may share confusions about the world and their places in it but they dont seem to have anything else in common. Making his directorial debut Jack Nicholson--who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeremy Larner based upon Larners book--doesnt introduce us to the characters with any clarity nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen. There are some very decent performances here (particularly from newcomer William Tepper in the central role) but most of the picture is unformed (perhaps intentionally) sketchy or unsure. Bruce Dern plays the hard-driving basketball coach Karen Black is the older married lady Tepper is having an affair with and Michael Margotta is Teppers wayward friend (in an off-putting over-the-top performance). Nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor preferring (I assume) to let the character interaction dominate the films tone; his script is no help either and as a result it is unclear whom were supposed to sympathize with. Small random moments do work (a supermarket fight between Tepper and Black Dern visiting Tepper in his dorm-room all of the scenes set on the court) however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess. Hoping to juxtapose an all-important b-ball game with a sexual assault Nicholson shows no style at his craft (nor does he earn points for chutzpah as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly). When a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors one has to question his motives in doing so. Perhaps if Drive He Said ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste. Unfortunately the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie. *1/2 from ****',neg
'So where are the cannibals? Those intrigued by the title and the real cannibal appeal of this film will be let down. Instead we are shown a strange man and his re-visiting of a Papua New Guinea village full of natives one of whom was his lover several decades prior. The man Tobias Schneebaum is New York Jewish as they come and somehow this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes.<br /><br />There are no real cannibals here: only stories relayed by some of the natives and by Tobias himself. Not all together a bad film. Very interesting and great cinematography. Schneebaum remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from Western Civilization as one can get.<br /><br />Its just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary.<br /><br />4 out of 10 kids.',neg
'Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film. The acting directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer/director/star Larry Bishop to get laid. The only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with QT. The plot of the film is pretty flimsy and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older B-movies and some cameos from guys like David Carradine Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Each one is listless in their performance particularly Hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career. The saving grace if there is one is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining. Bishop tries so hard to get that trademark Tarentino banter and just fails miserably which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others. Id only check this one out if you love bad movies...or if youre really into biker films.',neg
'This is a very amusing and sometimes quite creepy anthology that if a bit short in the screenwriting department more than makes up for the shortcoming in the acting location work and overall exuberance. The best episodes of this are the first with Denholm Elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works ( a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian); the third with Christopher Lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final episode with the late great Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspired both obviously relishing the opportunity to really ham it up! Cushing is typically good in the weakest segment which certainly isnt helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman hes obsessed with down at the local wax museum is anything but beautiful as we are told to believe she is! Someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead were given a woman with a jaw of a turtle. Minor quibbles aside this movie and its wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can.',pos

'Isaac Florentine has made some of the best western Martial Arts action movies ever produced. In particular US Seals 2 Cold Harvest Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can tell Isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always eventful creative and sharp affairs with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for. In particular he has found a muse with Scott Adkins as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for. This is borne out with Special Forces and Undisputed 2 but unfortunately The Shepherd just doesnt live up to their abilities.<br /><br />There is no doubt that JCVD looks better here fight-wise than he has done in years especially in the fight he has (for pretty much no reason) in a prison cell and in the final showdown with Scott but look in his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. Theres nothing in his eyes at all. Its like he just doesnt care about anything throughout the whole film. And this is the leading man.<br /><br />There are other dodgy aspects to the film script-wise and visually but the main problem is that you are utterly unable to empathise with the hero of the film. A genuine shame as I know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been. There are some good bits mostly the action scenes themselves. This film had a terrific director and action choreographer and an awesome opponent for JCVD to face down. This could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls-out action movie stakes.<br /><br />Sincerely a shame that this didnt happen.',neg
'Sheba Baby is another Pam Grier Blaxploitation film. It was one of Pams less visceral films of this genre. Pam plays Sheba Shane whos a Chicago gumshoe. Shebas father is the owner of a small loan company in Missouri. When local mobsters try to run her father of of business Sheba goes after the bad guys.<br /><br />Pam Grier had already made her mark in Blaxploitation films by the time Sheba Baby came along. Fans of both Coffy and Foxy Brown know that Pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress. In Sheba Baby the fiery performance that viewers had come to expect from Pam wasnt as evident in this film. Not that Pam doesnt kick-butt in Sheba Baby. Shes just not as much of a runaway-train vigilante as she was in her previous Blaxploitation films.<br /><br />The supporting cast in this film are a distinct disappointment. So Sheba Baby is Pams film through and through. And though Pams a bit more subdued than in her other films she still gives a compelling performance in Sheba Baby.

'Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th The Burning and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical final girl.<br /><br />Constance is a woods girl but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival shes a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend does the primal notion of survival kick in. Theres a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls hidden sexuality - coinciding that alongside her will to survive.<br /><br />Just Before Dawn isnt for everyone but for the slasher fan its as close to perfect as you can get. The killer(s) are very menacing - Almost like its a game to maim and murder anyone who crosses their territory. The end scene is a bit off kilter. For the first time viewer it may be a little shocking. Id recommend this to anyone whos a fan of the backwoods slasher. Even non-slasher fans will find something to like about it. The setting is eerie and makes one feel uneasy. The death sequences arent particularly gory but Im not sure the film needed gore. See it!',pos
'I was in this movie as an extra in the Dallas filming in July 1975. Some of the things you see todayand take for granted in movie making were implemented in this movie. The movie premise the costumes the special effects the acting. It all was ahead of its time. It opened the door for movies such as Star Wars the Terminator the Matrix and X-Men movies. Now people look at it and they say Well this does not add up to this new special effects story... It did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days. It did have a story and a wonderful cast and a hell of a director! The places it was filmed like the Dallas World Trade Center and the Zale Buildingand the Ft. Worth Water Gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film. The director Michael Anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and frailtys. It was my first film experience the first of six films I have been in. Just because it was filmed in Texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of filmmakers art. Watch it again and appreciate it more. This movie was the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now enjoy. Well my hand is blinking... I got to run. Santuary awaits...',neg
'Yes Marie Dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running.<br /><br />Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen.<br /><br />I watched this for Polly Moran whom Ive seen elsewhere. Here Moran is OK -- just OK -- as Dresslers shrewish friend/foe. Too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion.<br /><br />The plot is good hearted. Bad guys try to rob the townspeople. Dressler triumphs and all ends well.<br /><br />I do wonder about the central plot mechanism: bonds. This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly. I however not of that era am vaguely familiar with them. Theyre like stocks only different right? It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity.',neg
'Good movie great story great characters I enjoyed it immensely enough to buy the DVD when it came out. <br /><br />The real life story it purports to tell is more fascinating and engrossing than anything the fictionalizers could ever come up with. My friend who is in the media business said they shouldnt show insider dealings like this it gives the business a bad name. As if.<br /><br />There are a few problems with the DVD though: First the sound volume is awfully low so you have to run up the TV volume to watch it. I notice that its also like that when HBO runs it so its in the original production copy. Second for about the first five minutes the left side of the video is cut off that is the picture is cut off about one inch short of the left side. After the five minutes it fills the screen properly left to right. Sloppy technical production like that is very amateurish and I dont know why the director and producer let such sloppiness slide by.<br /><br />Still even with the technical flaws its an enjoyable story one of HBOs best I think.',pos
'I watched this movie because of Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly. I adored them together on Picket Fences so it was a treat to see them together again. This was not the best movie ever made but it was cute. Very predictable but sometimes mindlessly fun movies are just what I need.<br /><br />The desserts were gorgeous and I wanted to eat all of them. I did love it when that one fell apart though. I bet it still tasted good.<br /><br />Costas and Lauren still had the great chemistry that they had back on Picket Fences and I swooned as they kissed in this movie.<br /><br />I wouldnt watch this again but it was a great filler for one night.',pos
'**Attention Spoilers**<br /><br />First of all let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best films of the 90s. It was an amazing achievement for all those involved especially the acting of Liam Neeson Jessica Lange John Hurt Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. But alas...<br /><br />it constantly and unfairly gets compared to Braveheart. These are two entirely different films probably only similar in the fact that they are both about Scots in historical Scotland. Yet this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that Braveheart is a better film than Rob Roy. I like Braveheart a lot but the idea of comparing it to Rob Roy is a little insulting to me. To put quite simply I love Braveheart but it is a pale shadow to how much I love Rob Roy. Here are my particular reasons...<br /><br />-Rob Roy is about real people.<br /><br />Lets face it the William Wallace in Braveheart is not a real person. Hes a legend a martyr a larger than life figurehead. Because of this depiction he is also a perfect person never doing wrong and basically showing his Scot countrymen to the promised land. When he finally does fail it is not to his fault. Like Jesus he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most. He even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much.<br /><br />The depiction of Wallace is very well done and effective. But it really doesnt inspire or intrigue me. I find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection. That is why The Last Temptation of Christ is a better film than King of Kings and that is also one of the reasons why I think Rob Roy is better than Braveheart. Rob Roy may be heroic and brave but he is far from perfect. He makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones. Now sure not bearing false claim against the Duke of Argyll was an act of nobility and courage but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness. Let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act. But Rob did the best he could and that was all you could ask of him.<br /><br />Robs Wife Mary is also a normal ambigious person. Let us start though with how she looks in this film. Sure shes beautiful but she doesnt wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show. Compare this with the two loves (or one depending on your point of view) of William Wallace in Braveheart. Now these two ladies are hot but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time (especially the lay persons). Maybe not a fair comparison but just another example of how Rob Roys attempts for accuracy are far more effective.<br /><br />Throughout Rob Roy Mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion Cunningham. She feels compelled to tell Rob of her struggle but doesnt because she knows that Rob must seek revenge for her rape. Such revenge would surely mean the death of Rob and Mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice.<br /><br />The villains in Rob Roy are equally as compelling. Although the enemies in Braveheart are well written they are hardly original. Robert the Bruce a man both brave and cowardly is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm. Should he take his claim as the king of Scotland or should he betray Wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name? Bruce is the most ambigious character in Braveheart but from Brutus in Julius Ceasar to Fredo in The Godfather Part II these types of characters are hardly original. Longshanks although a compelling villain in his own right is very one dimensional. He is the epidemy of evil and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to Wallaces heroism.<br /><br />Rob Roy has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery. First of all lets start with Marquis of Montrose. He is a man who is so obsessed with his self image that hes willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it. See to it that I am not mocked are his favorite words to his factor. He is a man obsessed with power upset that a man of great noble bearing as the Duke of Argyll can be considered of greater providency then him. He is shamefully self obsessed and insecure. He is an evil aristocrat but in ways that make him unique.<br /><br />Cunningham and Callarn are the conspirators in Rob Roy and are also Roys direct assailants. Callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical. He will do anything to maintain the good will of the Marquis which includes backstabbing and trickery. Cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the Marquis. He needs a father little does he know that the Marquis is his real father. Therefore when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from Callarn he grabs it without even questioning it. He is very much like the evil of modern man so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others.<br /><br />Many have criticized Tim Roths performance in this film as overacting. Hogwash I say. It is clear that Cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film. In a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement is Cunningham too much of an unbelievable character? We live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life. Rob Roy simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed. It is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that goodness will prevail but snakes will always exist in our world.<br /><br />Another character that I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the Marquis. He appreciates the bravery of Rob Roy and Mary and has a direct vexation for the Marquis and his factor. He gives the world hope for the people of power. Hopefully people like the Marquis are an exception and not the rule.<br /><br />- The final duel in Rob Roy is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in Braveheart.<br /><br />One thing I get tired of is people telling me that Braveheart is a better film because of the battle scenes. First of all battle scenes are hardly original. From Spartacus to Gladiator Hollywood has had a long tradition of historical European battle scenes. Braveheart has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film but they suffer from one important problem. These battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom.<br /><br />Now dont get me wrong duels are hardly original either. In fact there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty to behold. It is one of the greatest scenes in film history. Let me explain why...<br /><br />First of all the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly. Cunningham is effette and dangerous Rob Roy is strong and courageous. Cunningham uses a fencing sword while Rob uses a broadsword. Cunningham fights with quick tricky movements while Roys fighting style is more obvious.<br /><br />The whole film from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half is leading up to this moment. It is powerful stuff and it is clear that Rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world. When Rob finally gets the upper hand (literally and figuratively) it is one of the greatest moments in film history. Rob wins because he has more to live for and his honor is more powerful than 10 Cunninghams. The use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene. Good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell FREEDOM!. But hey maybe thats just me.<br /><br />- Rob Roy is more realistic than Braveheart<br /><br />I dont know that people in the aristocracy or Scotsmen talked like the people in Rob Roy but I do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. I feel that many people are bored by Rob Roy simply because they cant understand what the characters are saying. If this is the case then read some Shakesphere or put on the close-captioning. Rob Roy is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90s. Many of the dialogue in this film is clever but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it.<br /><br />By contrast the dialogue in Braveheart is hardly very interesting. Of course what do you expect when the main character is a Scotsman played by an Australian? This is a legend and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times. This film takes place several centuries before Rob Roy and yet they talk like the people today. Thus the reason that many people like it better. Audiences today have become increasingly lazy and they dont want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex. Therefore as with many epic films they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable English accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our American language. Sure it is clear that the Wallace is Scotish but other than sounding like Scotty from Star Trek and a couple of Ayes for acknowledgement the Scots in this film fit into the Hollywood tradition of how we believe Scots should sound.<br /><br />So do these descriptions prove that Rob Roy is a better film than Braveheart? Hardly. But if it proves one thing it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that Braveheart is a better film than Rob Roy. To put simply Rob Roy is a film that has themes that are very apropos in todays world. Braveheart is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic. You can make a decision on what you think is better...<br /><br />Grade - A Score - 9',pos
'Next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes Graduation Day! All of those seniors just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. That is however IF they can make it TO graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic whos running around gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... Yeah it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later her older sister returns home from the Navy for Graduation. The track coach holds the blame and broods in his demoted position in shop-class while the girls boyfriend still mourns her death a year later... All of these characters are prime candidates for Serial Slasher of the Year and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who-done-it. Graduation Day is fun though it isnt spell-bindingly original by any means and there arent a whole lot of memorable demises but there is enough going on to keep you mildly entertained. Like Linnea Quigley screwing the music teacher and getting busted with a joint 30 year-old actors playing teenagers and of course... Rollerdisco! Gotta love that crap! You can do a lot worse than Graduation Day kiddies...',neg
'Lillian Hellman one of Americas most famous women playwrights was a woman with a mission. Her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country. In her memoir she recounts her trip to the then Soviet Union as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system. Watch on the Rhine must have come as a result of those years. The left wing in America as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism not only in Europe but in Japan as well.<br /><br />Watch on the Rhine was a play produced on Broadway eight months before the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese. In it Ms. Hellman was heralding Americas entrance in World War II. The adaptation is credited to Ms. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett her long time companion. As directed for the screen by Herman Shumlin the film was well received when it premiered in 1943.<br /><br />We are introduced to the Muller family when the film opens. They are crossing the border to the United States from Mexico. They are to continue toward Mrs. Mullers home in Washington D.C. where her mother Fanny Farrelly is a minor celebrity hostess. The Mullers we realize are fleeing Europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact we thought in a way the Mullers could have been better justified if they were Jewish fleeing from a sure extermination.<br /><br />We find out that Mr. Muller has had a terrible time in his native land as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing Fascim. Little does he know that he is coming to his mother-in-laws house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy.<br /><br />The film offers excellent acting all around. It is a curiosity piece because of Bette Davis supporting role. Paul Lukas repeating his Broadway role is quite convincing as Kurt Muller the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family. Mr. Lukas does a great job portraying Kurt Muller repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on Broadway.<br /><br />The other best performance is by Lucile Watson who plays Fanny Farrelly the matriarch of this family. Geraldine Fitzgerald is seen as Marthe de Brancovis a guest of the Farrellys married to the contemptible Teck de Brancovis a Nazi sympathizer played by George Coulouris. Beulah Bondi Donald Woods and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by Mr. Shumlin.<br /><br />The film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule no matter where.',pos
'Oh my god what a horrible film. The film has all the right people involved unfortunately it is not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I had paid to watch this I would be even more upset. This film is unwatchable. How could Tarintino be involved with such a slow paced unexciting film. No wonder it didnt get much distribution every one involved must have been ashamed. I can make a better film with a Dated Camcorder and my Big toe. Its beyond boring I really hated it. Tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes. This must be some kind of sick joke. Dont Bother with this film. If some one even hints you should watch it kill them.',neg

Thats the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie! Music was a little better than the acting. If you get around to watching this I hope its because there was absolutely NO other option! The sequel (yes sequel) is coming on now....I think Ill skip it! Jason',neg
'I opted to see the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it had been selected to the Cannes film festivals prestigious Competition section. I was surprised that Cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality.<br /><br />The film some reviewers have noted does not have too much of gunfire--but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy/competitor in front of your young son..or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are some hints of the contrasting Corleone sons in Copollas Godfather that seem to resurface here in this Chinese/Hong Kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese.<br /><br />This film is only recommended for violence junkies..there is no great cinema here. At best it might be considered to be better than the usual Run Run Shaw production for production values.',neg
'If youre a fan of the late Gram Parsons then this movie is definitely going to divide you! Part comedy part road movie but mostly a bad fictionalization of one of rock historys oddest tales.<br /><br />SPOILERS-- <br /><br />Basically the story concerns a well-known roadie named Phil Kaufman (played by Johnny Knoxville) who supposedly made a pact with cult rock/country/folk music hero Gram Parsons that stated when one of them died first (it didnt matter which one it was) that the other living one was to take the deceased out to the desert Joshua Tree National Park in California to be exact and set the body ablaze...so as to free the spirit and become one with the earth and so on! Sure to keep his word the barely sober Kaufman with the assistance of a self-hating pot-headed buddy jacks the body of the late Parsons -whom had fatally overdosed from a drug and booze bender a day prior- from the airport. And shortly after that what ensues is a cringe-worthy combination of fiction and truth where the late Parsons girlfriend Kaufmans girlfriend Parsons stone-faced father and a gaggle of police officers and other pointless idiotic characters all try to beat the clock (so to speak) in trying to catch Kaufman and his pal before they get the chance to torch Parsons body! <br /><br />The films incompetent direction bad acting and lame offbeat tone in general all sink this movie faster than the Titanic. And not to mention the huge fact that this movie is not even halfway telling the truth of the actual events that took place. The accuracies that should have replaced the inaccuracies as far as Ive heard them include: number 1. Parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a child so what the hell was that all about with the girlfriends and the chasing and whatnot? number 2. Kaufmans drugged-out buddy was a known willing participant (unlike what the movie attempts to portray) in the disposing of Parsons body and finally number 3. Gram Parsons real-life father died when he was just a boy and so it was Parsons step-father (who could have honestly cared less about Gram Parsons when he was still alive) in real-life that took care of the body after it was torched! Altogether though what probably disturbs me the most about this movie is that the real Phil Kaufman was actually on set to help assist with the facts of the story. And yet still the movie ended up becoming so untrue and so bad that it really boggles my mind frankly! <br /><br />Also as the mediocre aforementioned acting in the film is concerned its lead character played by the ultra-grating Johnny Knoxville (Phil Kaufman) is not only a bad actor but it actually seems as if he were asleep throughout most of the movie and the rest of the pathetic cast are for the most part either hysterical brain-dead or seem utterly clueless as to what theyre actually doing there in the first place! Overall if you like Johnny Knoxville and or really dig the so-bad-theyre-not-even-good buddy flicks then I suppose you just might get a kick out of this movie! But if youre like me and are a fan of the late Gram Parsons enjoy films that attempt to tell the truth as much as they can especially if theyre based on an actual real-life story and or you just like good films be-them road movies or fictional slice-of-life stuff you will truly loathe this film and advise others to do likewise. I obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been made in the first place but since it was made I would have preferred it to have turned out differently than what it did unfortunately! Maybe some day the real facts of the story will come through and be made into a really great biopic on all of Gram Parsons life...not just what happened to his body after his spirit left it. But until that time comes all we as an audience and or fans of the late performer get is this sad waste of film and an all-around terrible memorial (of sorts) to the musical legacy that Gram Parsons was known to have left behind. It should also be noted that they did actually use Parsons music and a few others as well in the flick but not surprisingly though you never get to hear enough of it to really enjoy it even in the slightest bit.

'For me Pink Flamingos lived up to its reputation as being the shocking disgusting repulsive trashy film I was expecting it to be that really contains everything but the kitchen sink. We are treated to almost two hours of nastiness that never lets up: rape sex sex with chickens transsexuals castration murder cannibalism and a horrid display of singing out ones anus. It is about a strange couple who begin a competition with a trailer trash family trying to steal their title as the filthiest people alive. Divine (a fat guy in drag) is an unbelievably vile human being who actually becomes painful to watch. Trust me when I say that this film is not one to be quickly forgotten especially the end scene in which Divine eats dog crap off the sidewalk. I have always thought John Waters was over-rated and I cannot say I like this film but it is an experience if you ever get a chance to see it.',pos

'Best in Show is a often hilarious mockumentary that takes us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who prepare for the event. The only thing that separates this movie from real dog shows is that the dogs in Best in Show act more sane than their owners! Funny stuff from a top-notch cast that includes Eugene Levy (who co-wrote the film) Catherine OHara Parker Posey Michael McKean Jennifer Coolidge Jane Lynch and Christopher Guest (who co-wrote with Levy and directed). Theyre all funny but Fred Willard steals the movie with his explosively funny performance as the dog show announcer who says the most outrageous things. Plus the dogs are cute too. Best in Show isnt exactly the laugh riot that I expected but there are laughs and its worth seeing.<br /><br />*** (out of four)',pos
'The Journey is a very good film. Produced in the spring of 1958 in Vienna and released in 1959 this movie was quite popular in his early years. Despite the political problems which influenced the movies success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution the Cold War) The Journey is a very good film but not well-known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home. One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner their intense relationship. All their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the great passion and love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is the script which is very well written. It was even published as a novel by the screen player George Tabori. The film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end. At first we didnt know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary because the Communist Major discovers that Dianas friend Paul Kedes is Hungarian and he isnt allowed to leave the country. The Major falls deeply in love with Diana and this is in fact the true reason why he doesnt want to let her go. But after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen and she kisses him too he lets her go. And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed-the Major and Diana say Goodbye! she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers including Paul while Surov is shot several times by some Hungarians so he dies. Yul Brynner is very very handsome and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful charming refined just like an English Lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of the greatest couples of the Golden Hollywood. A true moviegoer should watch this film. The Journey has everything that a good film should have-a great captivating story interesting characters a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is in my opinion at his best). Finally I want to give a message to Warner Bros. Studios or those who restore and release classic films: Please release The Journey on DVD as soon as possible.',pos
'One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middle-man Titta Di Girolamo a physically non-descript middle-aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When were introduced to him at the start of the film hes been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamos cash tell him that 10000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you cant bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth. Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamos troubles. <br /><br />This initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 a man who wont even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non-life Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous. The first half of the film may be described as slow by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamos days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). <br /><br />Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dellAmore or LImbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonists insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way the Al Pacino film Insomnia) Le Conseguenze dellAmore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise thats been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious its almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani grand-daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Tittas best friend a man whom he hasnt seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though its never explicitly spelt out the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations Le Conseguenze dellAmore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare more La Vita è Bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dellAmore LImbalsamatore and others. Your loss world.',pos
'Yes. It takes a Norwegian to ruin and slaughter two great books and a concept that would work well on film - this film truly is The Worst Swedish Film Of All Time. I hated it so badly that I even considered walking out on it something I have never done. But it was so awful i was almost compelling. I just had to sit through to the end. Much like some early-80s Stallone action reel this one REALLY takes Swedish action back to the stone-age. So full of logical errors and stupid mistakes it is almost amusing - but who could ever see anything good in the terrible acting Mark Hamills surviving a mine-field or the dumb-ass useless and irrational action?<br /><br />Let me ask you: arent we through with clocks ticking down to zero the hero escaping in the nick of time and two friends become enemies reuniting by the end? STUPID!!!!<br /><br />And one more thing: the product placement in this film is unbelievable. While other countries have understood that it shouldnt be so OBVIOUS the Swedish film industry apparently hasnt understood at all: just look at the credit card Hamilton uses to open a window?

'Elizabeth Taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying untalented self in this film. This was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more range like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie. The whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long. The actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up.

'The CinemaScope color cinematography of Leon Shamroy is quite remarkable hereincluding his use of colored filters for<br /><br />various scenes. The Alfred Newmann Score has to be the most sensual and seductive score Hollywood ever produced. Its a shame it is no longer available on CD. The actors however never rise to the occasion. The accents are so varied from the subdued British of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision. Tommy Rettig is jarringly American. Acting styles span the range from zombie-like to stilted. Only Ustinov as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal. The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single God Ra - persecuted by the authorities has its interesting points. But when the films plot fades it is the haunting music and visuals that remain.',neg
'A group of tourists are stranded on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their boat. They are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected it isnt called Snake Island because its just soooooo much fun to say - it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls. This is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from NOBODY actors. The only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which aint anything couldnt see in a PG13 rated movie folks. If you are into snake movies than check out SSSSSSS but dont torture yourself with this crap.',neg
'I have seen a lot of PPVs in the past but this is the most entertaining intense PPV and the most complete DVD i have ever seen. The DVD extras are worth it because they it gives a different view of how the wrestlers act after the show (such as the chris benoit interview/edge interview) some glimpse into the Monday Night Wars erathe first match of Hogan winning tag title gold and some promotional talk. Additionally there is a good music video.<br /><br />1. Tag Team Table match: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris benoit 7/10 This was a pretty good intense match to start off the show. Not too many holds and just pure raw physicallity. Spike can hold his own in tables matches and Guerro and Benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the mat. <br /><br />2. WWE Crusierweight championship: Jamie Noble w/ Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd really didnt care about either wrestler and didnt get interested until Kidman did a shooting star press. Usually people expect a lot of high flying in a cruiser weight championship but this had very little. In fact it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher no one even cared or knew (you can tell by the lack of cameras flashing). The ending was quick though. <br /><br />3. WWE European Championship: Jeff hardy v. William Regal 5/10 Ive never really liked regal as a wrestler he lacks intensity and style. Hardy was impressive but really didnt get a chance to show off his high flying act although he still performed some good counters and added that needed fast pace to the match. It ended off quickly which was perfect for this match. <br /><br />4. John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 Its funny looking back at Cenas very first PPV how he used to act how he used to dress and how he used to look (watch his interview its pretty funny). This was a good intense match with Cena showing a nice variety of holds suplexes counters and some aerial. Jericho was sub-par but definitely helped Cena launch his career. Cena Wins.<br /><br />5. WWE Intercontenital championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This was a very intense and good match. Both wrestlers styles really matched up well on the screen with Brocks pure power and raw energy vs. RVDs skill full moves and quickness. RVD looked great in this match (better than his later matches with edge and cena)and the entire match was fast pace. The ending worked perfectly because it still preserved Brocks undefeated streak while giving RVD his just desserts in his home state.<br /><br />6. No disqualification match: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the RVD match but still a good follow up. Although it started off kinda slow (which it always is with big show) Booker T was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table. The finisher was awesome the ending was a great upset and big move up for Booker T.<br /><br />7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 This was a mediocre match. Hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy. Then again Christian doesnt exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself. This ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still OK for PPV. <br /><br />8. Triple Threat Match for the Undisputed Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle.<br /><br />Easily the match of the year. This is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen. It had close falls plenty of finishers stolen finishers raw energy intensity and fast pace. No one could predict who would come out of this one. If your going to buy this DVD i would buy it strictly for this match. (ending? watch for yourself!)<br /><br />Overall this was a solid PPV with plenty of extra goodies to keep you watching again and again. Although this is hard to find (i had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD) it is definitely worth your money.',pos
'I have seen this movie many many times and I will never get tired of it. It is a classic in every sense of the word. The movie is hysterically funny and yet quite touching all at the same time. For those of you who are not a fan of subtitles or of foreign film in general open your mind. This is a great movie for the beginner because the story is so entertaining. Dont get me wrong it is 100\% Japanese (and that is what makes it work) but everyone will get something out of it (even if it is just a great laugh at one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters I have ever seen!)<br /><br />I cant even think of this movie without smiling!! I love it ... and I think most people will too.',pos
'Stay FAR AWAY from this film. The fact that youre reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys. This is a truely horrid movie... so lets get down to the problems. Writing and Direction: It wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive gradeschoolers that watched scream and I know what you did last summer a few too many times. GIANT GAPING plot holes abound; while I cant congratulate them for this movie its nice knowing theyre finally potty trained. Actors(or lack thereof): Only the finest for this film... the finest extras ever to grace a screen now starring in their speaking role debut! As a disclaimer I have to note that I am capable of watching and enjoying just about anything. I recognize a good movie when I see it but I can still giggle and smirk during Bubble Boy (yes folks its true); so when I say to avoid something you KNOW Im not kidding.',neg
'I dont think I need to tell you the story. For it has been told for years and years. So I will just share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella was when I was five years old. From then on I was a Disney child in a good way. The animation now seems childish and old fashioned but that is part of its charm now. Now in the age of High School Musical and computer generated images it seems like people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early Disney movies. Thankfully I was born before that so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems no matter how old I get I turn back into that five year old watching it on VHS. Which is the true magic of Disney.',pos
'David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `House of Games a character study fraught with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel Driven. Still she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; theres an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve and it primes her vulnerability. When a patient Billy Hahn (Steven Goldstein) confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers and that theyre going to kill him if he doesnt pay she decides to intervene on his behalf. This takes her to the `House of Games a seedy little dive where she meets Mike (Joe Mantegna) a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world. Instead of the `twenty-five large that Billy claimed he owed Mike shows her his book and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars. And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean if shell agree to do him one simple favor which involves a card game he has going on in the back room. In the middle of a big hand Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone her job is to watch for the `tell of one of the other players. By this time not only Margaret but the audience as well is hooked. The dialogue and Mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines is mesmerizing. As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling surreal realm of existence and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game we are swept right along with her. From that first memorable encounter when he demonstrates what a `tell is and how it works to the lessons of the `short con to the stunning climax of this film Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless. And nothing is what it seems. In the end Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature and about herself. She changes; and whether or not its for the better is open to speculation. Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows and does. Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm self-assured exterior and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated. She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does and makes you understand it as well. The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum (Joey) Lilia Skala (Dr. Littauer) J.T. Walsh (The Businessman) Ricky Jay (George) and William H. Macy (Sergeant Moran). `House of Games is the quintessential Mamet; hes written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since and will no doubt grace us with more in the future. But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up. Youll find it under `Perfection. This is one great movie you do not want to miss. I rate this one 10/10.',pos
'Oceans 12<br /><br />If you steal fifty million dollars they will find you. (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber Die Hard)<br /><br />This adage certainly rings true in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and his compadres were the ones who ripped him off and now he wants it all back. The Ocean gang need a lot of money and fast but cannot work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So its off to Europe to perform acts of death defying thievery whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones super cop an old flame from Rustys (Pitts) past. <br /><br />On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the Night Fox a super slick thief with a legend complex. He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full or land them in some kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive-type-sequence. Interesting? Well yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty. <br /><br />Ocean and his band of merry men are charismatic if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more pally situations and conversations. Too many. Damons Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins are bickering as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadles cock-er-ney accent is as bad as ever (I really like Cheadle but could not abide this). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends filling each others glasses and reading each others minds. However what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development versus how slick the whole damned op was. And as much as these actors work well together Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight 11 sided hole. She simply doesnt fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent.<br /><br />The stars of this film for me however were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderberghs choice of locations. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he was born into both. His Night Fox is arrogant awfully cavalier with other peoples lives (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean gang. This is where I think the film loses its way. Cassel and the European locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the American actors and the style of the first film. We want slick brash and quick-witted; not gritty considered and intellectual. This is where the film doesnt work.<br /><br />Admittingly you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter but going to far left or right usually does more damage than good in a mainstream film like this.',pos
'Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish and hes come to London to buy coal in Confidential Agent a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall Katina Paxinou Peter Lorre Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen hes accused of murder but hes determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the Fascists.<br /><br />This film has its good and not so good points. It rates high for atmosphere and for suspense and it is highly entertaining. Bacall is incredibly beautiful Boyer is passionate Paxinou is mean Lorre is slimy Hendrix appropriately pathetic and Seymour outrageously wonderful.<br /><br />The not so good points: Bacall is supposed to be English and Boyer Spanish. Uh no. Boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent but Bacall is 100\% American not of the British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat miscast. Her acting isnt up to snuff either; shes better in other films. But shes an astonishing looking woman and much can be forgiven.<br /><br />Paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. Its a great part and his performance is perfect while some of the direction of the other actors isnt as good. This was definitely a case of no small parts only small actors. Seymour wasnt a small actor.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing even with its flaws.',pos
'Young writers young auteur young cast busload of producers what could go wrong? Everything. Even lame is too good a description that suggests that three of four legs were functioning when actually none of them were. Barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour gratingly stretched to ninety minutes. The audience was talking back to the screen so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad cops frame good cops. Again how many times? There was not an original shred in this entire concoction. Giovanni Ribisi made a valiant effort to prop up the lack of script drawing the only laughs of the entire movie. And the thought of he and Claire Danes working from a real script with a grown-up director and photographed by an actual cinematographer intrigues me. Note to screenwriters: Buy one of those story generators. It cant possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television. Note to auteur: There are shots available to you other than closeups. Even the lovely and interesting face of Claire Danes eventually grows tiresome in closeup. Note to cinematographer: Apprentice yourself to a professional for a few years--you have much to learn. Note to color timer at the lab: At least try to persuade the auteur and the cinematographer that they dont know what theyre talking about. Note to Claire: I hope this paid for your new condo. Its time to get some professional management and start actually reading the scripts before signing on.',neg

'Like many others I counted on the appearance of Dennis Hopper to make this not a complete waste of time. I was sadly mistaken. Everything negative said about this flic is more than true. What takes the cake however is the horrible horrible storyline for the main character.<br /><br />Heres why: The planet might be destroyed the ONLY way to recover from it for the ENTIRE human race to be saved trough it is to get as many smart capable nice competent people into an underground hide-out. And Dennis Hopper is the lone seer/scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst and who has realized this. But whats the main motivation of Stevens (Sonny DAngelo)?? Hes angry because Dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed! While it clearly explained to Stevens that Dennis character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at. The Hopper-character was the boy with the finger in the dike and now Stevens is blaming him for picking and choosing??? And if that isnt enough he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout because it isnt fair!? AND.... hes responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanitys saviour! OH MY GOD how stupid can you get?<br /><br />Whats also maddening that IMDb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap. I mean TWO MILLION in budget what could have been done with that? Think Clerks Blair Witch and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100.000 dollars and were still better. AAAAARGH! I count myself lucky that I didnt pay one penny to see this crap and to sit through the end of this utter úber-crap is one the most heroic things Ive done this year. Its no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera operator and title designer before ...',neg
'We all know whats like when we have a bad day at the office right? Well this Neil Simon comedy looks at what its like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office. Sometimes its just not worth going know what I mean? And sometimes its just not worth doing something when its already been done before in 1970 with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis... and much better also.<br /><br />Its not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec; quite to the contrary on both counts. And its not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either; her work has been consistently good if not great ever since I first saw her in TVs Rowan and Martins Laugh-In of the 1960s.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that its not about the hapless couple at all: its really about New York and why everybody should come to New York to live and love their lives away in married bliss  sort of  in the greatest city in the world. Thats if youre a New Yorker...<br /><br />Look the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment. This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess. For example not content with the star appeal of the main players there is a cameo (relatively long also) from Rudy Giuliani then mayor of New York as we all know. What  Giuliani bucking for President even then? Worse  a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of New York.<br /><br />And then we have John Cleese reprising his role as Basil Fawlty  but this time as a prancing cross-dresser also  once again browbeating hotel staff sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is in this role. And in the process doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers arguably the best British comedy series bar none...<br /><br />Why was this 1999 movie made? In the 1970s New York was a dying city in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. So when made in 1970 that was the city you saw: grim dark moody unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke (as it was then polluted and all). By 1999 things had gotten better: glitz was back New York was thriving it was the Big Apple ready for you to bite into if you had the moxie...<br /><br />So naturally the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Hence this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon. If youve seen the latter then definitely dont bother with this one.',neg

'I cant believe that they took this off the air. Especially when they only had a few more episodes left. My daughter sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show. We were so upset when they stopped showing this because of so called ratings. It is not fair to the people who were watching this show since the beginning. We had a right to see the end. I wish they would take an overall vote from all people with a 3 times a year voting system. They could send out papers in the mail and we as viewers could give an overall vote on all programs that we watch or have heard about. This could also help promote a new show. People would see it and wonder what it is. Not only could you see what the viewers are watching you could also use this as a tool for free advertisement for TV and cable channels.

'My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old. I have never forgotten it. I had never before seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two when she made Elephant Walk) Remember Im nine so the feelings arent sexual I just couldnt see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her. She has begun to show her age (Shes almost seventy-four) but I still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived.<br /><br />I have seen the movie several times since and it is a sappy melodrama. What saves it is of course Miss Taylors beauty magnificent scenery the very impressive elephant stampede and a well-made point on human arrogance in the face of nature.<br /><br />All in all a well-spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video.',pos
'Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzogs filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997 it has lost none of its power and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzogs own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morriss Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former it details in its far too brief 74 minutes the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see. Yes we see the violence and the heroism but as The Fog Of War brought us into the mind of one of last centurys foremost warmongers this film allows us a peek at the life of a grunt who is captured by the enemy tortured and ultimately triumphs. Except in no way shape nor form is the film as simplistic nor upbeat as my brief description of it. Nor is Little Dieter Needs To Flys titular subject Dieter Dengler and immigrant German who survived the depredations of the Nazis (we find out as example that in his hometown Wildburg in the Black Forest his grandfather was the only man not to vote for Hitler and suffered brutally for that stand) post-World War Two Germany and his own imprisonment at the hands of the Vietcong when his Air Force jet was shot down over Laos on February 1st 1966. While the title of the film and the idea of Denglers passion for becoming a pilot stirred by the impression Allied fighter planes made on him when they razed his town as a child make one believe that Dengler is the central subject of the film this is not true. The subject is Denglers survival or more precisely his human will all human will. The details of Denglers romantic life are too Hollywood and staid an aspect to interest Herzog. Nor is the fact that he won a Purple Heart Medal of Honor the D.F.C. and the Navy Cross. That thing which pushed Dengler to survive so much and remain such a relatively upbeat man (although there are glimpses of darker sides) is what is at the center of this film and all of Herzogs canon. Dieter Denglers distant barbaric dream of his past is fully ripened Herzog Country and the use of a Madagascan chant Oay Lahy E during many jungle scenes among other excellent touches in the score show Herzog is perhaps along with only Martin Scorsese the best manipulator of image and music in film. Long may he merge!',pos
'This is an excellent modern-day film noir....excellent in that its interesting start-to-finish. There are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief.....but I havent found anyone who didnt get caught up in this story. The movie has the right amount of action suspense plot twists and interesting characters. In addition it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar-based soundtrack. <br /><br />I labeled this crime movie a film noir because its gritty and the all the characters are no good. Even the only supposed-good guy played by Nicholas Cage gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he shouldt have. He also does something at the end which isnt right but Im not going the spoil it by saying. Suffice to say however that the rest of the characters are so bad they make Cage look good!<br /><br />Speaking of bad guys does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the deranged category hes tough to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons. J.T. Walsh gives another great supporting performance too.<br /><br />This is one of those films that never got much publicity but it should have. Youll have fun watching this.

But after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life I mean I could almost feel the pain he made us believe he was going through. I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought at Robert De Niro Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more. But nowadays they are either old or dead (Brando) and its OK that they make less movies and their performances are lighter than they used to be. I cant wait to see Gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role. Can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance?',pos

Black and white suits the film.<br /><br />Straight forward formula a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they die.<br /><br />Very well directed and the acting is great. Richard Widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over shadowed in the acting stakes by Paul Douglas as the police captain and Jack Palance (never better than this) and Zero Mostel as the baddies.

Im a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film I was eager to see it. But I was shocked shocked I say at the quality of this film. Those later films boast well-crafted plots 3-dimensional characters and the best film music since...well...ever. This film just doesnt come close.<br /><br />Might as well start w/ the positive aspects though. Like all Miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasy/sci-fi setting in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time. (though not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazakis later films) And the English voice acting is quite well done.<br /><br />But this film...just...isnt...good... The characters are all cardboard - from saccharine sweet little Nausicaa to the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians to everyone in between. Once youve seen each of them for 30 seconds youve seen all there is. And the fact that the plot just ambles along doesnt help.<br /><br />Then theres the music... Now Hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer but Nausicaa doesnt do him justice. Half the music is 80s keyboards on overdrive and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them. I highly suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture.<br /><br />But wait! Theres a great message with this film right?! Lets all save the environment! Too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer. There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree. No really. I aint kidding.<br /><br />It makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is. But for some reason all the other reviews on IMDb seem to adore it. And when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you whats going on thats lame.<br /><br />If youre the kind of person who worships anime enjoys 80s music and plants a tree every Arbor day you will probably like this film. Otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time.',neg
'My Comments for VIVAH :- Its a charming idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegrooms families sleeping on the floor playing games together their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals. Yes the central romance is naively visualized. But the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism. The film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries: Come let me do your dressing<br /><br />V I V A H - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage beauty of Indian culture beauty of Indian woman last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the about-to-be-couple waiting to get married .... playing by the rules ! Simple yet Beautiful; Such a Simple story .... no plot ... no villain - as is the case with most of Sooraj Barjatya films. Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST. He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION. Its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout Arranged Marriage & the Union of 2 Families. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good & she has acted very well. She has most of the good scenes - although i thought the last half hour was completely to Shahid Kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance. I also liked the acting of all others for ex. the Choti i.e. Amrita Prakash Alok Nath Anupam Kher Shahids bro & sis-in-law. It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could. Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME.<br /><br />Stuff like Sanctity in a Marriage/Relationship Avoiding Courtship Mutual Respect Care & Space Waiting for getting Married officially Praying/Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more get SHOWCASED in Vivah. Theres still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film. Some of the folks/audience are already excited after seeing that they r thinking bout Arranged-Marriage :) Thats Success if you ask me. it seems AMRITA RAO - our actress-from-Vivah {Result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006 !! Hats off to her for this achievement Chalo even though Vivah  Shahid or Amrita didnt get any of the film-fare & other awards; @ least this is news to CHEER about !! Congrats to AMRITA RAO- for showing us a visual of Indian Bride-to-be in the purest form and Of Course to Sooraj Barjatya for portraying her the best way :) Shudnt forget Shahid Kapur and all others who make VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today !! Imagine to share the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... Its no mean achievement !! Congrats to Amrita Rao - for taking her Career to another level with this award .... I personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with Shahid Kapur !! They make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /><br />Some points that I observedfew of the elements :- #1 If u notice carefully Amrita Rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses. She gives every bit of the Indian Woman essence - in this film !! Perfect Fit #2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early-marriage .... but PREM listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his DAD - having full faith in Anupam Kher. Eventually Honesty & Trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with Amrita. Most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But according to what I saw in this film I have a feeling - that Two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also Its possible !!! #3 In the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrita are together - or shown to be together. Its unlike most other romantic/wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine are always singing/dancing or nowadays - doing cheap stuff. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences :- Characterized by restraint innocence & respect for the other ! #4 I really liked the relationship shown between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao. These kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters/girl-kids in some parts of India. #5 Romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely - no cheap scenessongs are beautifully pictured !! Words like Jalpraarthana e.t.c. are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film :) Personally I really am fond of many dialogs in this film. #6 Last but not the least - The entire Hospital Scene where Shahid puts sindhoor to Amrita when shes struggling for Life - is terrific. Those dialogs between the couple are so touching and U feel the LOVE/I-cant-do-without-U ; Its a Hats-Off feeling !!! <br /><br />*** In many ways VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya DDLJ Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the freshness/on-screen-chemistry of the LEAD pair :) :) *** IF U ASK ME :- Along with films like Rang De Basanti Lage Raho Munnabhai DOR CORPORATE and Kabul Express V I V A H ranks among the best films made in 2006. IN FACT - i think Vivah does deserve better viewing/business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all those time-pass/fuzzy/style/crap movies !!',pos
'While browsing the internet for previous sale prices I ran across these comments. Why are they all so serious? Its just a movie and its not pornographic. I acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it. Ive shown it to many of my friends & they all loved it too. I feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of Shirley before she became popular or well known. After reading the other comments I agree that the film is racy. Big deal! I only wish it was longer. It seems that I must be the only person who owns one of these originals for sale at least so I wonder how much its worth?',pos
'This film is one of the classics of cinema history. It was not made to please modern audiences so some people nowadays may think it is creaky or stilted. I found it to be absorbing throughout. Cherkassov has exactly the right presence to play Alexander Nevskyi just as he did when he played Ivan Groznyi (Ivan the Terrible) several years later. The music was beautiful.<br /><br />My one complaint was the poor soundtrack that was quite garbled. Although I only know a little Russian it would have been nice to be able to pick out more words rather than having to rely almost 100\% on the subtitles. I was watching this on an old videotape from the library though. Perhaps by now a DVD version exists on which the sound has been enhanced. I would like to know whether the actors were using archaic Russian or even Old Church Slavonic when they were speaking. The subtitles were strangely worded and its hard for me to tell whether this was to reflect an older manner of speaking or whether the subtitles were just somewhat poorly done.',pos
'Kristy Swanson plays an elite hitwoman who is supposed to have knocked off a TV reporter for a group of bad guysbut once she sees this poor fellow at home playing with his kids she decides to junk the whole project and the TV reporters life is spared.The hitwomans life is up for grabs as the people who wanted this reporter killed now want her dead for not following through with her assignment.Such is the basis for a movie called Supreme Sanction.<br /><br />Supreme waste of time is more like it.We see Swansons character beat uppummel and kill men far bigger than her.And she always one two fifty steps ahead of the group of murders who cantfor some reasondo away with this super hitwoman.Having one woman do away and beat all these menmakes the movie seem so gay.It is too predictable once you figure Swansons character is going to win out anywaythus making the film boring and inept.<br /><br />Kristy Swanson is decent actresswho in her younger days was always sexy and easy on the eyes.Supreme Sanction is not one of her better efforts however.',neg
'This reboot is like a processed McDonalds meal compared to Ang Lees very good but very underrated 2003 The Incredible Hulk.<br /><br />Ang Lees The Hulk is a comic book movie for the thinking person. The Hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes) but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonists core. He does his best to avoid losing control but as he admits when he does give in to his rage he likes it.<br /><br />Now compare this to Edward Nortons turn where there is no display of conflict in his personality and he turns into the Hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute (not 183 not 197 but exactly 200). To this reviewer this felt akin to the introduction of midi-chlorians in The Phantom Menace which tell how strong the force is with one as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test. In the 2008 movie all Ed Nortons Bruce Banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200 as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist. And for the record it is extremely difficult to get ones pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run especially for a physically fit person.<br /><br />Emotions drive Eric Banas Hulk. He has repressed memories of his mothers death and his fathers role in his early life. On the surface he is calm but there underneath there is significant anger enough rage to fuel the Hulk when it is unleashed. But the Hulk never kills intentionally even his attackers. Mostly he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision.<br /><br />In the 2003 movie the visual effects are there but as necessary. The action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are necessary to the plot unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action.<br /><br />In his quest to turn it into a fugitive story Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. To him the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry. And Louis Leterrier the director picking up on Ed Nortons cue fails to add any emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summed up as: Banner is pursued and Hulk kicks butt Banner is pursed and Hulk kick butt. Repeat as necessary.<br /><br />The only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version. However even as I am a fan of the comics I would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboys dream but has heart over the comics-loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day.<br /><br />Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man also released in 2008 is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic-book roots and has heart.',neg
'Una Giornata Particolare is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar I thought I had seen it more than once. Now that I finally I have seen it I am very glad. This is one of the better Italian movies I know with one of the most wonderful performances by Marcello Mastroianni who stars in other masterpieces such as La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2 both from the great Federico Fellini. Directed by Ettore Scola this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day the day Adolf Hitler visited Rome.<br /><br />Marcello Mastroianni plays Gabriele the neighbor of Antonietta (Sophia Loren). She is a member of Mussolinis party pretty fanatic in her thoughts and he is a member no more. The reason for that I will not reveal. On the day every person from their building including her husband and children is out to see Hitler they are still in the building. Antoniettas bird escapes and flies to Gabrieles apartment and this is how the two meet. Right before Antonietta went to Gabriele he thought of killing himself again for reasons I will not reveal. How the story develops from here I will not reveal but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day not the fact that Hitler is in Rome.<br /><br />Like I said Mastroianni has a wonderful performance. You see he is a man who desperately wants someone around him although at first we dont know why. May be he likes Antonietta may be he is in love with her may be there are other reasons. Antonietta feels what we feel. What does this man want from her? She likes the attention anyway. We see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man. Loren plays the scenes very good as well. We understand her questions although we cant be sure what her intentions are. The moments where we find out both their secrets if that is what you can call it is a great moment. How the story develops from there is even more interesting but I dont want to spoil it for you. This is a movie you should see. Great performances and a beautiful cinematography and the message it gives us still stands today.',pos
'I just saw this movie tonight. Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman alot and Susan Sarandon is a great actor too but it was way better than I could have imagined. You come out of the movie feeling great. The acting was excellent which is something that can be hard to come by lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor. Anyways back on subject the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and I definitely think that everyone should go see it. I would give more details but I dont want to give away the movie.',pos
'Terry West had a good idea w this movie. He just didnt flesh it thru. There are endless shots of the creepy looking schools exteriors that go on forever and probably to pad the films running time. Also at this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning). If the script centered on her interesting character wed have a movie to watch. She is so GORGEOUS!! Good news for DVD buyers Terry Wests earlier (and better) film Blood For The Muse is a special feature. One thing Id like to say is that this movie feels like someone whos not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feels that very same way. Then again just watch this for Ruby LaRocca.',neg
'This story about a mans 28 year struggle for a death that would liberate him from his already dead body becomes a masterpiece to be rememberedthanks to a team of artists in a state of grace. Directed writtenedited and scored by Alejandro Amenabar it touches you from the very first images and doesnt leave your eyes and your heart to rest until the last credits thanks to Alejandro and a group of wonderful actors and actresses at their best. Bardem is an acting animal:One of those few comedians that can make a masterpiece from almost any character the supporting actresses are great in their roles and the story is told with such a sensibility that one laughs and cries in the same minute as we used to do with the great old masterpieces. The years best film in all senses. 10 / 10',pos
'It is such a shame that so many people love Family Guy because it is easily one of the worst shows on TV there are many points to address here. <br /><br />The Flashbacks: Now in Season 1 and 2 which I think was exceptional the flashbacks were quite frequent and actually somewhat tied into what the plot was about and was even funny. Now season 4 and on the flashback s are even more occurring and has NOTHING to do with the plot arent funny and really long boring and meaningless. Family Guy thinks that long drag scene which go nowhere are funny when really it is poor writing.<br /><br />Stewie: Wow a baby that sounds British. How funny can that be? Its not. His character is so unstable its unbelievable. Remember in the early seasons when Stewie was all about world domination and killing Lois. Well now he just has scenes that are awkwardly gay with Brian. From wanting world domination to being gay = bad writing.<br /><br />References: How do they manage to keep making poor references to 80s TV shows or events? Well they just re-use the same old garbage. You know in 20 years hopefully Family Guy will be canceled by then if they are still doing jokes about shows from the 80s it will be even more irrelevant than it was before. Because will have forgotten. This still keeps me wondering why they cant just writ good episodes with quality jokes.<br /><br />Voice Acting: My God the voices in this show is so poor. Seth McFarlene should just focus on his crappy episode writing and stop doing voices. All the extras in the already bad Family Guy episodes all sound the same. The Simpsons get 6 or 7 people to do ALL the voices. A few of them are voicing about 15-20 characters...all sounding very different. But why cant Family Guy do that? Oh right its a crappy show.<br /><br />The Stuttering: Usually done by peter Stewie Brian and any extras whenever they talk or are offended by something they have to stutter out their sentences just to try get a cheap laugh. I cant believe that Family Guy cant even speak normally to get people to laugh at their jokes.<br /><br />Offensiveness: OK short and simple Family Guy tries to break the barrier and be cutting edge but really they fall flat every time. Go watch South park...<br /><br />Terrible Plots: The plots and story lines are just utter trash. The Simpsons have started their 20th seasons are STILL have better plots than Family Guy. About a total of 8 or 9 minutes is flashbacks and drag scenes which have no relevance. <br /><br />Popularity Lots of little kids have Stewie shirts and think hes so funny when really they dont even get the terribly written sex jokes. They just say oh ha ha stewie! when they dont even get it. Family Guy has gotten canceled twice and brought back by DVD sales how sad is that. They got canceled the first time I think after the 2nd or 3rd season and I honestly believe that shoulda been it. those episodes back then were superb they shoulda left on a high note.<br /><br />Drag Scenes and Falling There are scenes that go on way too long. One that just aired this last Sunday Peter went to an executive bathroom in which about 2 minutes was spent imitating the intro to Jurassic park and the plot of that episode is stolen from a Seinfeld episode as well. Also a scene when Chris is working at a store and hes talking with the employee for about 5 minutes about a movie which also features the stuttering. THE CHICKEN FIGHTS ARE SO STUPID 3 of them each one longer then the last. useless unfunny writing thinking that people enjoy long scenes of rerun fighting between a CHICKEN yeah a chicken. now every time someone falls down and by the way NO FAMILY GUY FAN CAN DENY THIS that every time they fall down its under a split second and they ALWAYS land with their arm over their back to make them look funny i guess its been used at least 30 times.<br /><br />Herman Oh jeez everyone thinks the old pedophile is so funny when its just a really bad running gag. theyve even gone to lengths of giving him singing scenes (which are very poor) and basing ENTIRE episodes around him theyve done the same thing with other characters like the doctor who I know has had an episode based around him.<br /><br />The Simpsons Well not much explanation needed here. There is so much evidence of Family guy stealing Simpsons jokes. How family guy is just a poor mans Simpsons.<br /><br />so Im sure Ive forgotten some key points somewhere but Im sure this is enough to prove that family guy is really a terrible horribly written TV show that everyone seems to love when really they should go watch Simpsons Seinfeld and Frasier.',neg
'The plot in Petites Coupures certainly left this viewer dumbfounded.<br /><br />***spoiler***<br /><br />In the space of 48hrs or so Auteuils character has an affair with a teenager loses his wifes affections attempts to seduce Scott Thomas is rejected by her goes on to grope yet another female character in the back of a car and then is finally shot for his trouble.<br /><br />***end of spoiler***<br /><br />wha ???<br /><br />The only saving grace in this flick is Kristin Scott Thomas.

'Recap: Its business as usual at Louches casino in Tanger. The casino is about to close and prepares for a big transaction the next day. The owner Louche and some staff leave for the night leaving Modesty in charge. Suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino shooting wildly. Unknown to Modesty they have already killed Louche and are now after the money hidden in the vault. But no one present and still alive at the casino knows the code to open the vault. The vault itself is heavily booby trapped with explosives so the assailants cant blow the door as planned. Suddenly Modesty finds herself eye to eye with the gangsters leader Miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in jeopardy.<br /><br />Comments: This is a review written with no connection what so ever with other published media about Modesty Blaise as I have neither seen nor read any of it. The first point I like to make is that this is slightly wrongfully classified. Foremost I thought this was a thriller with a battle of wits between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Sure there are some bursts of action but they are not really an integral or important part of the story.<br /><br />As already mentioned the main plot and the main suspense-filled scene is the game between Modesty and Miklos. Its an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of a character and in doing so much of the story takes place outside the casino at a much earlier time. Someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a TV-series and the feeling is that it might indeed be used as such. But I felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many other have done. I was in no way disappointed in the lack of action instead I enjoyed this game the history much more than a simple action movie.<br /><br />I think the two main stars Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau did very well. Staden especially portrays Modesty very well and really carries this confident and talented character.<br /><br />7/10',pos
'The Messengers is a badgeneric and boring horror movie.The film has got a big problem:it does not scare.The performances and the screenplay are totally stupid.It uses old tricks for scaring and all the supernatural events make laugh.I would not call The Messengers as a bad movie...I would call it an accidental comedy because its so bad that makes laugh.The only good thing about this movie is that its shortso this crap will not stay with us for so long.There are a lot of masterpieces of horror genre which count with a low budget(like Subject TwoLucky or May)which are sadly ignoredwhile this crap is all a success in the box office.SoI do not recommend this weak and pathetic horror film which is called The Messengers.',neg
'The Haunting. A remake of course. The original was a creepy psychological thriller and one that has improved with time. Compared to this 1999 remake its a classic. There is no character development here only caricatures (the slut the authoritative brain the Im gonna get us outta here fellow the oh so sensitive bookworm). But seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the star I guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern. Unfortunately the effects are laughable. Mewing cherubs stretchy doors irritating dead children that cant speak plainly ... and an idiotically sappy ending that does its darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows. Ill take my Skittles orally thank you. Bruce Dern Ive liked you since The Cowboys. Stop it.',neg
'I would have given this film a one star vote had it not been for the laughs I got out of it. Some of the dialogs were just plain so lame that they make you laugh!! How could some one have actually talked like this. Not to mention the fact that the bodyguard Majors (Antonio Sabato Jr.) flew a 747 like a pro and Michael Pares team of whiners were able to dig a trench filled with gasoline and blow up a huge boulder in the nick of time. Did anyone notice the lame tribute to Fantasy Island with the guy saying Boss the plane!! to Michael Pare just as the 747 comes in sight.<br /><br />The only saving grace were the cute girls and even cuter female hijackers. Not to mention that the main hijacker deserved to die the lame death that he did for being such a joker!! Imagine escaping from being tied up just to shot by a crossbow. Hello.<br /><br />The poor pilot probably died in the plane while everyone was eating steak and having rum!! Just for laughs they should make a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the midst of a Category 3 hurricane on Neptune Atoll. Did I hear Michael Pare calling it the best honeymoon resort in the Pacific. Now that would make an interesting movie!!',neg
'Yep you read that right kids. Michael Bay shouldve studied this film before making either of his over hyped overlong overly pointless Transformers movies. Robot Jox is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the Transformers crew spent on Megan Foxs personal trainer.<br /><br />Thankfully this little robotic gem initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted Charles and Albert Bands Empire Pictures studio seems to have developed a cult following over the years. I fondly remember watching it on VHS during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the Cold War-era politics/stereotypes were already out of date by that time (just the Bands luck that Communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released eh?) its still a pretty damn cool little B-Movie. They really dont makeem like this anymore or if they do they go the Bay route and CGI things to unbearable proportions.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar heres the Robo-scoop: Were somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust large scale wars have been outlawed. Disputes between nations are now settled mano-a-mano (or perhaps that should be machine-o-machine-o) by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized Shogun Warrior style robots. Whichever bot walks away from the fight wins for his side. Gary Graham (who would later go on to play Detective Sykes in the Alien Nation TV series) plays Achilles the greatest Robot Jock in Marketplace (a.k.a. the good guys) history. Achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine Robot bouts (ten being the maximum number of battles before a Jock is retired) and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the Confederation (i.e. The Russkies!) the psychotic Alexander (who is the most over the top evil Russian stereotype bad guy since Dolph Lundgrens infamous turn as Ivan Drago in Rocky IV). The match is called a draw when Alexander violates the rules with an illegal Robot Move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing Achilles but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain. A rematch is scheduled to complete the bout but Achilles simply wants to bow out hang up his helmet and move on with his life. Rather than violate the Spoiler Rules by revealing much more I will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns behind the scenes skullduggery and other difficulties for Achilles and his fellow Jox before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale.<br /><br />I hope Im not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction because it isnt. Robot Jox is just plain fun. Ill grant that it is a bit higher-concept than your average B-grade sci-fi movie and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known (especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green-screen trickery) it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the Empire/Full Moon Pictures factory. The robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion/model techniques and the sets and costumes dont look half-assed in the slightest. Empire Pictures and director Stuart (Re-Animator) Gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture. Unfortunately it didnt quite pan out for them (or the studio) but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal. Bottom line: if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2+ hours feel free to rent a Transformers movie. By the end youre likely to feel like youve spent all that time watching someone else play a video game. If you want to have a rockem sockem robot good time pick up Robot Jox instead.',pos
'SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />You can listen to Wong Kar-wais movies like a radio play: Invisible vibrations between the characters the rooms where they stay in the rhythm that presses them ahead attraction and dislike - the whole spectrum of the atmosphere is played back by the sound track. The dialogue is mostly completely unimportant.<br /><br />The narration is similar to a childish amorous look at a beautiful woman and a sad man whose sorrows are noticeable but helpless. In The Mood For Love is told from a child perspective but the child never appears as a narrator. The aesthetic of the film is developed by an extreme light and color dramaturgy harsh cuts an unattached almost documentary camera and a complex unobtrusive sound.<br /><br />The genius use of Nat King Coles Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps whose mysterious power grows the more often it is repeated and the melancholic waltz helps in the graceful choreography of the two protagonists. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses is brilliant the perfect vis-à-vis to the handsome stylish Tony Leung. The audience assumes a romance between them but Wong just sees sad resignation. The two potential lovers are revolving around each other like satellites knowing that they never will share the same orbit. You wish that they will find each other. They wont and the emotional power of their non-love-sex-relationship makes the movie immensely fascinating.<br /><br />It is about broken luck and unspoken love. In all of Wongs films these are the leitmotives. Love whether it comes too early or it comes too late to take the one and not the other person. The yearning of the characters that is never satisfied their loneliness the mourning and the luck that they experience when it is too late.',pos
'After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.<br /><br />The Aristocats is a classic definitely. It might not be a five-star classic but it is a fun film and makes a good evenings entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy and I think it just about succeeds.<br /><br />The storyline doesnt really make much sense and I dont think the plot is particularly strong but it is certainly not weak. The animation and backgrounds are a bit scratchy in places typical of Disneys 70s films but it does have a rustic old fashioned charm about it.<br /><br />The Aristocats strongest points are the characters the music and the humour. The music is very memorable - try getting Everybody Wants To Be A Cat out your head in a hurry! The songs are written by the Sherman Brothers who also did the music for The Jungle Book. There was one song called She Never Felt Alone that was going to be in the film but sadly didnt make it into the final feature. It is a shame because I think it would have fit in very well.<br /><br />The characters are unforgettable. Thomas OMalley is voiced by Phil Harris and is basically Baloo in a feline form. Eva Gabor gives Duchess this warm and maternal feel and the kittens voices actually sound like children and not an actor imitating the voice of a child. The secondary characters are here by the dozen and yet you still end up understanding their personalities. Edgar the villainous butler plays a similar role to Cruella De Vil but hes more comical than scary often ending up in funny situations. Even though hes the bad guy hes still lovable all the same.<br /><br />The two British geese - Abigail and Amelia really had me cracking up along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like the dogs who tend to argue over who is the leader. I could go on but I wont spoil it. But I can tell you The Aristocats is funny and will entertain everyone without having to resort to rudimentary toilet humour.<br /><br />The bottom line - The Aristocats might not be Disneys crowning achievement or even their strongest film from the 70s (that award is a tie between The Rescuers and The Many Adventures of Whinnie the Pooh). But it is an enjoyable romp and is sure to entertain. If you are looking for a dazzling work of art you might be better off watching Bambi. But if you want a fun night in The Aristocats is the way to go. It is a charming and lovable film and its impossible to dislike. Enjoy! (And besides its good to have a film where cats arent seen as the villains).',pos
'I caught this movie on late-night TV. Honestly i saw most of it and the whole time i was sitting in complete and utter disbelief.<br /><br />Is there any genre thats more pointless than soft-core porn? If there is i dont want to know about it. Softcore porn combines all the horrors of porn (lousy production values abominable acting crappy scripts) with the coyness of sex-scenes in regular movies. So the end result is arousing nor entertaining. This movie also has the rather odd approach of a science-fiction setting and it works horribly. All the sex is performed in some sort of virtual reality setting where the crew from the future learn about physical love. And yes its about as confused and silly as it sounds.<br /><br />But there has to be some positive points though right? Well there is one... Krista Allen is amazingly hot. Thats about the only thing that was less than awful in this movie. I dont know what it is about her but she has an amazing sex appeal. The rest of the cast look like the standard porn-cast though. Rather unattractive women with poorly done fake breasts and men that have spent far too much time in the gym toning themselves grotesque. Probably a gym in Germany as well judging by haircuts and clothing.<br /><br />To sum things up. If you enjoy Krista Allens presence on screen you can watch this for the brief moments where she shows some of her seductive potential (most of the time she tries to articulate crappy lines of dialog though). If you dont enjoy Krista Allen then you might as well stay away altogether.<br /><br />I rate this 10/10 for Krista Allens sex appeal 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for entertainment value since this is a unique crappy porn/science fiction hybrid thats not really like anything ive ever seen.',neg
'Drones ethnic drumming bad synthesizer piping children singing. The most patronizing world music imaginable. This is a tourist film and a lousy one. What really kills it is the incoherent sequences. India Egypt South America Africa etc etc. No transitions no visual explanation of why were suddenly ten thousand miles away no ideas expressed in images. Just a bunch of footage of third-worlders with baskets on their heads as another reviewer said. Walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a 3rd World music video all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya were shot and film in Mexico. That would have been a much better setting for life in transformation.<br /><br />But no. What they decided on was a scrambled tourist itinerary covering half the globe and mind-deadeningly overcranked filter shots. The only thing to recommend this film is that it doesnt suck quite as much as Naqoyqatsi.<br /><br />RstJ',neg
'I just witnessed a movie that by all rights should have been fodder for a second rate MOW on Lifetime...but trust the Irish to keep it from being anything but saccharine. The set-up all but SCREAMS Heres a message concerning whats TRULY important in life but the execution was way into the Lets see just what we can get away with here.<br /><br />It helps to have two fantastic actors in the leads -- James McAvoy (as Rory) and Stephen Robertson (as Michael). While Rory is offered up as the near saintly one -- never mind the language and attitude hes the life force in this piece and could easily have been insufferable in his ultimately caring attitude -- McAvoy keeps him sharp enough to keep him from being too sweet. But the revelation is Stephen Robertson as Michael. Not since Leonardo Di Caprio in ...Gilbert Grape has anyone so perfectly captured a person with an affliction that I began to believe he really was an actor with cerebral palsy. And his eyes...my God he can rip you apart with them.<br /><br />This movie is to paraphrase Rory f****n amazing. Go see it. Take a box of Kleenex and enjoy every well-earned tear...and laugh.',pos

'SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /><br />I really am in the minority on this one but I liked this movie. Its not a classic but its definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride. I definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating.<br /><br />Perhaps the reason I liked it is because I havent seen the original.Something tells me that with a movie like this its strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus have little to compare it to. This was not a masterpiece but I did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original.<br /><br />There were a few things I liked about it. One was the casting of Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. Since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders he really needed to be excellent and he was. This was a great role for him.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that its made for television. I had no idea this was the case when watching it. It sure seemed like a major motion picture and I would never have guessed this was not a big screen release.<br /><br />I also found the story to be very absorbing. Im not one for action movies but I got sucked into this. Plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama mysticism a love story quirky people every which way you turned. (I didnt even recognize Priestly.) And it was touching. This was not a great movie but it is watchable.<br /><br />And then theres the ending. It packs a strong punch and if ones been involved in the story up to that point its very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end. I am not sure how I feel about the ending. The implication was that Kowalkski survived and though Im highly skeptical of HOW that would be possible it is a movie and realism isnt an ingredient thats always in the mix when making a movie.<br /><br />So Id have to say I found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way which I dont usually like but for some reason is almost forgivable in this movie. Admittedly a lot of things were just props for the plot(could the villains have been anymore stereotypical?) But the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well. However having said that I will admit I can understand why someone whos a major fan of the original would hate this version because though I have not seen the original I have seen many original movies I loved being remade with terrible results. (My big dislike is actually sequels.) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality.<br /><br />People have compared this to Smoky and the Bandit. How about a road version of Legends Of The Fall meets Thelma and Louese as well? I sure felt touches of both films(both of which Im a fan of.) I do not think however that this was a great film. It was better then average to me but far from great. But it was an absorbing adrenalin fueled touching movie with excellent casting of the main character. My vote is 7 of 10.',pos
'Well where do I begin my story?? I went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the Actors that were in it and that it was supposed to be a horror movie.<br /><br />Well I figured out within the first 20 minutes what a poor decision I had made going out seeing this movie. The Plot was crap and so was the script. The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically.<br /><br />The cast couldnt have been more plastic looking. Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker...like they dragged on for no particular reason. Very poor editing.<br /><br />All in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money. Boo.',neg
'Jake Speed is a fine movie with a wonderful message. It has its flaws of course. At times its a little slow. It introduces its villain too far into the story. Its action is paced at the rate of a snails heartbeat. It has a Z-grade cast (Although Ive always admired the work of Karen Kopins who has the straight-laced good looks of Sandra Bullock).<br /><br />But with all this going against it Jake Speed really is inspiring thanks to a charming script by Wayne Crawford(who plays the title role) and Andrew Lane.<br /><br />Why do I find it so inspiring? Because it says to me Hey why not try to be a good person.<br /><br />The story is essentially a stranger in a strange land premise that is good-and-heroic Jake Speed is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people. Jake is more than a Boy Scout. Hes more than a knight in shining armor. Jake Speed is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty mean and evil world.<br /><br />Its because of this that Jake Speed really needed to be a hit. It has a great message that should have gotten out to Hollywood and then to the rest of the world.<br /><br />Imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people. Im not saying that we should be watching the Waltons in every theater at the cineplex but that it would be nice if more movies such as Jake Speed would get a chance. (Due South a TV show about a Canadian Mountie is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up American entertainment.)<br /><br />Sure Jake Speed has violence blood and guns but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person youll beat the forces of evil every time. 10/14/99',pos
'For all intents and purposes Teen Devian might seem like just another lightweight Bollywood musical. To some extent this might even be true especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes either Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the idea for this story) or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations.<br /><br />This is not simply about a handsome man flirting with 3 women undecided on whom to choose as his lifes partner. Dev Anands character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times and they with him despite being aware of the other two. Dev Anands relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting - in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily. There are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewers maturity. The theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame that the ending was tame obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism.',pos
'This is the most boring pretentious and stupid film I have seen in a long time. I saw it at the Academy in Beverly Hills and there were quite a few people in the lobby who had left the screening and were seeking refuge there. All were solemnly shaking their heads and looking as though they had been to a funeral. What a waste of time and money. Even worse are the critics who gave this pretentious blimp good reviews. Whats with them? Are they just afraid they wont be considered hip? Were they bribed? This film is staggeringly bad. Dont take a date to it expecting to have an in-depth chat at the Cheesecake factory afterwards. If going to see this film was your idea shell browbeat you and hold it over you the rest of your life.',neg
'Based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name Killshot suffers from a lack of focus direction and creativity  all elements which the original story likely had and negative test screenings forced severe edits (including the complete excising of a character) resulting in a film that feels almost nothing like a Leonard story. Far too many characters populate a storyline too simplistic and straightforward (not a typical trait of the authors work) and the focus continually switches between two hit men who are difficult to like and a troubled couple who dont command our sympathy. While the story itself provides precious few twists and turns sadly by the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery. <br /><br />Washed-up hit-man Armand The Blackbird Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during his missions that inadvertently sours his latest assignment. Now on the run from his former employer he haphazardly joins forces with inept misfit criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to gain some quick cash by extorting a wealthy realtor. When struggling couple Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are privy to the thieves blundered plot they are forced into hiding as the crazed killers will stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses. <br /><br />Killshot proves that being based on an Elmore Leonard novel isnt grounds for immediate success or even a promising adaptation. The characters situations and even resolutions in the film are all tired and unoriginal and only very randomly hint at something more. Its not that there wasnt potential especially when Rourkes black-garbed calm and collected assassin perfectly executes a hit during the opening scene  purpose and principals are just continually abandoned as each minute ticks away. The style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most intriguing; visually the roles of Bird and even Wayne are fleshed out befittingly giving immediate interest and depth to personas that typically end in a creative impasse.<br /><br />The pairing of the cold and calculating Black Bird with the irrational and explosive Richie is an enticing combination (comparisons to Fargo would be extravagantly too kind) except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that kept them initially interesting. As Richie starts picking up the more experienced killers habits Bird loosens his grip on his own methods of murder. Regardless of what he sees in his momentary lighthearted fling with Donna (Rosario Dawson) its hard to imagine that his final confrontation with panicky Carmen would provoke a confession of his true nature and subsequent carelessness that drastically affects his outcome. Likely or not this is Killshots unfortunate downfall  and little entertainment can be garnered from these characters who steadily lose their originality by continually contradicting the habits that once made them intriguing. <br /><br />- The Massie Twins',neg
'We all know whats like when we have a bad day at the office right? Well this Neil Simon comedy looks at what its like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office. Sometimes its just not worth going know what I mean? And sometimes its just not worth doing something when its already been done before in 1970 with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis... and much better also.<br /><br />Its not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec; quite to the contrary on both counts. And its not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either; her work has been consistently good if not great ever since I first saw her in TVs Rowan and Martins Laugh-In of the 1960s.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that its not about the hapless couple at all: its really about New York and why everybody should come to New York to live and love their lives away in married bliss  sort of  in the greatest city in the world. Thats if youre a New Yorker...<br /><br />Look the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment. This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess. For example not content with the star appeal of the main players there is a cameo (relatively long also) from Rudy Giuliani then mayor of New York as we all know. What  Giuliani bucking for President even then? Worse  a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of New York.<br /><br />And then we have John Cleese reprising his role as Basil Fawlty  but this time as a prancing cross-dresser also  once again browbeating hotel staff sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is in this role. And in the process doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers arguably the best British comedy series bar none...<br /><br />Why was this 1999 movie made? In the 1970s New York was a dying city in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. So when made in 1970 that was the city you saw: grim dark moody unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke (as it was then polluted and all). By 1999 things had gotten better: glitz was back New York was thriving it was the Big Apple ready for you to bite into if you had the moxie...<br /><br />So naturally the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Hence this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon. If youve seen the latter then definitely dont bother with this one.',neg
'Bottom line - best romantic comedy ever. This movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for: the creation of a world and time that we want to re-visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race. When I am blue this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh (and that is still true after many viewings - always fresh).<br /><br />All of the actors are in top form. The characterizations are so dead on and the characters mesh so well together that you forget the actor (usually difficult to do with Matthau Robbins and Ryan). The supporting cast is consistently brilliant: Fry (agae a total pygmy package!) Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists as Greek chorus - but time doesnt exist) Durning (something we can launch from NJ) Shalhoub & Whaley (Robbins boss and co-worker at the service station) and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies have Eisenhower??).<br /><br />Dont miss this overlooked treasure.',pos

Aside from the intense slapstick scenes there are others more subtle but just as funny. Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot. Or watch the real object prompting Moes exclamation Oh...highly polished mahogany!<br /><br />Emil Sitka is at his bewildered goofiest. And the goon may look scary but hes somehow funny. He seems as frustrated and perplexed with the Stooges as are regular people in other shorts.<br /><br />For Shemp aficionados this is a must have episode. It wont disappoint.',pos
'Dee Snider was inspired to do a two part song by a horror movie. This movie he wrote/directed/produced and starred in details the subjects from those songs (Horror-terriafrom TwistedSister/ Stay Hungry). People have commented he must have a sick mind to put something like this out. I dont hear anybody making comments like that about Stephen King Wes CravenDean Koontzor in his own time Alfred Hitchcock. The movie profiles a modern Psychotic created by current trends in society.

'A few thoughts before I get to the heart of the film: 1) I have never seen so many bare breasts in a film before displayed in so many non-sexual scenes -- it was weird; 2) Joseph Fiennes where have you been? You charmed us in *Elizabeth* and *Shakespeare in Love* and then you went away for awhile. Mainstream American wants more! Okay Im a college English professor I have read this play many times and this is probably the best film version Ive seen of it. While individual aspects of other productions may have stood out this is the overall package put together well. Pacino is no Olivier but he doesnt need to be so get over it! The films cinematography is stunning and not just because of the bare breasts. Venice is portrayed amazingly and you do get a feel for really being there. Portias residential island is amazingly beautiful and the lighting is always tinted the proper way for the scenes appropriate moods.<br /><br />The anti-Semetism in this film/play is hard to watch especially at the end. Pacinos dropping to the knees and clutching his religious artifact is perhaps the most powerful moment of his on film since *The Godfather Part III* (when Michaels daughter is gunned down on the opera steps). Is the play anti-Semetic? Sure. Is *Othello* racist? Sure. Take it for what it is: a commentary on the Elizabethan era not a commentary on today.<br /><br />Fiennes is underutilized in the film but still a pleasure to watch. The women in the film are alright; no one really stood out here but they do blend in nicely with the scenery. Jeremy Irons and Pacino are excellent in the two juiciest roles adversaries until the end. Ive always felt Irons was underrated (I still get chills when I hear his voice from *The Lion King*) and Pacino is Pacino.',pos
'I love the 80s slasher flicks and I remember when Silent Night/Deadly Night was pulled from our theaters I was very disappointed so I was very excited to see some of these on Fear.net. You Better Watch Out was what Ive come to expect of these types of movies. The quality of the special effects were laughable by todays standards the character development too long but all in all it was laugh out loud funny! <br /><br />The scenes where he loses it because Santa aka dad is feeling up his mom and later when the mob is actually shown lighting torches - not flashlights as you would in the 80s but real torches! - really tickled my funny bone. However the scenes where he was checking on the kids in his neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of a different nature. I also enjoyed trying to figure out who some of these character actors were. It took me awhile to figure out that the main character was the lovable teddy bear on Brothers.',neg
'There are movies that are leaders and movies that are followers.<br /><br />Meatballs was a leader.

Of course that one had Bill Murray. So what does Party Camp have?<br /><br />Im glad you asked that question.<br /><br />Jewel Sheperd has made these flicks her bread and butter and what a side dish SHE provides! Even as an innocent (wink wink) girlfriend to a rich twerp (Cribb) she provides that sultry steam she gives to all her parts. And yes guys she shows (if you know what I mean and I think you do). My gosh that smile of hers could melt through titanium.<br /><br />What? Oh yeah the movie. Nothing special as I said; every cheap joke is aimed for and hit (at about crotch-level). And eternal teen Jayne is good for a laugh or two. But instead of a sense of humor theres just nudity lame sex jokes more nudity a soft-core dream sequence a sex symbol nurse simply for (CLOTHED!) leering purposes even more nudity....<br /><br />Hmmm...

'The true story of a Spanish paraplegic Ramón Sampedro who fought for decades for the right to be euthenized. This film along with the Best Picture winner of the same year Million Dollar Baby caused a stir that year with their depictions of disabled persons desiring death. Both advocates for the disabled and (unfortunately for the disability advocates) conservative pro-life groups protested both films and their Oscar nominations. The nominations also came during the entire Terry Schiavo debacle just to put it all in some historical perspective. The protests especially from the disability groups against Million Dollar Baby make some sense  the film clearly depicted without wavering the life of a paraplegic as worthless. The films central character Maggie Fitzgerald becomes a paraplegic doesnt seem to get any counseling whatsoever no help whatsoever and immediately wants to die. The film is honestly pretty dumb and uncomplex. The Sea Inside based on the true story is certainly a lot more thoughtful on the subject. It most likely got railroaded into the same category as Million Dollar Baby without its protesters having even seen it an incredibly common phenomenon. The film does give time to many different sides of the argument. And it immediately declares that the wish to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone. It is guilty of a couple of crimes though and Id still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it. First and foremost theres the protagonists meeting with a paraplegic bishop. I dont look kindly on the way hes depicted. His orally operated wheelchair is depicted as absurd and theres almost a comic sequence where his effeminate boy-toy servants are dragging him in his chair up the stairs. He cant even reach the room in which Ramón is located and one of the boy-toys is forced to carry the conversation between them. I had to think gee maybe if Ramón lived in a slightly more wheelchair-accessible household he wouldnt spend his entire life in bed and might find life more fulfilling (who knows how closely the film depicts the reality). Director Amenábar (The Others) also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this film about suicide more life-affirming like a cross-cut sequence where Ramón looks thoughtful and his lawyers baby is born. But besides a few ugly moments the film is very good. It hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. However in the end our lives do belong to us. Shouldnt we have the right to choose? The films strongest asset is its supporting characters and the actors who play them. It depicts how Ramóns fight and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful precision. The family members in particular are great and Ramóns final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking and had me in tears. My favorite performance in the film comes from Lola Dueñas whom I also felt gave the best or at least certainly most undervalued performance in Almodóvars Volver last year.',pos

Its pretty stupid to whine about but for me hearing Demolition come out to their theme music at a Wrestlemania in person was a memory that I never forgot and it didnt exist on this DVD.

'This movie is a great movie ONLY if you need something to sit and laugh at the stupidity of it. As a geologist this movie gets most of the important facts wrong and uses actors that are too young to even be considered in the top of their fields. It is interesting how it shows spurting lava in massive caverns below the Earths surface. It also is funny how seismically active areas are shown to have massive destruction from a 6.5 magnitude earthquake. They seem to forget the building standards in these areas would be higher needing a bigger quake to do this much damage. Also it is funny how much they make the coast line of Washington State and also Oregon to look as though they are nice beaches of Southern California. The Jelly donut analogy is very entertaining even if the way it is used is wrong. The director does a good job of adding more comic relief with the 2 supossed PhDs.',neg

'Raoul Walshs mega-epic stunning filmed in an early widescreen process by the great Arthur Edeson can be slow and static in the early talkie manner but this classic wagon train journey across America to the NorthWest is thrilling as a sheer physical production when seen on the big screen.

'Film starts in 1840 Japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide. Its a very gory bloody sequence. Then it jumps to present day...well 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert) wife Laura (Susan George) and their annoying little kid move to Japan for hubbys work. They rent a house and--surprise! surprise--it just happens to be the house where the murders took place! The three dead people are around as ghosts (the makeup is hysterically bad) and make life hell for the family.<br /><br />Sounds OK--but its really hopeless. Theres a bloody opening and ending and NOTHING happens in between. There is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious! They look so fake--I swear I saw the strings pulling one along--and theyre muttering!!!!! Theres a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show off Georges body) another one about 40 minutes later (but that was necessary to the plot) and a really silly exorcism towards the end. The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />As for acting--Albert was OK as the husband and McClure was pretty good as a family friend. But George--as always--is terrific in a lousy film. She gives this film a much needed lift--but cant save it. Im giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing. That aside this is a very boring film.',neg
'This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s but the majority of his other films are on video if not DVD. That being the casewhy isnt this one? A friend recorded it off of TCM for me but to have it on DVD would be great. For special features they could have say a Marine historian talk about the battle and if Mr. Schmids wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well. Anyway this is a great movie and I highly recommend it.If it ever is put out hopefully it wont be colorized. Colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film. The battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945film would go. Mr. Garfield did a superb job of portraying Mr. Schmid. Some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of Mr.Schmids disability but I feel he got it just right. I sincerely hope they come out with this movie on DVD someday as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in World War Two.',pos
'Basically the first two Critters movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way. This movie is way more of a B-movie that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons.<br /><br />This is the first sequel that doesnt really follows the plot of the first two movies. Basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well as good as none since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late) and the budget for this one obviously went down again. To save even more costs the movie got shot back-to-back with part 4 which I imaging will be just as bad since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this one.<br /><br />Its just a typical B-genre movie that doesnt really have any originality in it or brings entertainment. It makes Critters 3 a real redundant sequel you can easily do without. Granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just aint exactly a good one either. The movie just falls flat as a science-fiction/horror/comedy.<br /><br />Also kind of strange to notice how the Critters has suddenly changed in this one. They are about double their usual size this time without giving an explanation for that and they are even more Gremlins like in this movie than was the case in the previous one.<br /><br />The movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of Leonardo DiCaprio. He was about 17 in this movie and of course looking baby-faced like he still does now. I like watching this well known actors in their early roles. Its fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course DiCaprio got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these days.<br /><br />Really a too silly and lame movie.<br /><br />4/10',neg
'the first Childs Play was an original and effective little horror movie. as expected though the 2 horrible sequels seemed to spell the end for this franchise.<br /><br />well when i heard they were making a 4th one called bride of chucky i just rolled my eyes and muttered a ...when will they ever learn.<br /><br />but when i heard that they had gotten a great director Ronny Yu and a solid cast including the awe inspiring Jennifer Tilly my interest in it perked up.<br /><br />this film is extremely well done. it has a great sense of humor highly stylized graphic violence great cinematography and the stunningly sexy Jennifer Tilly strutting her most impressive stuff during the first half. (i should add that she is also a fantastic actress as well.)<br /><br />it keeps its tongue firmly in cheek without veering into campy territory. the doll effects are great and the verbal interplay between them is priceless. its more of a horror/comedy than straight horror but the humor is welcome and well integrated. <br /><br />ive already heard that theyre planning a Son of Chucky. if they can match the quality of this film than maybe this franchise will have made a legitimate comeback.<br /><br />rating:8.5',pos
'Like all of the very earliest films this movie is very very short--lasting about one minute! So because of its brevity its not really possible to compare it to more modern films. But for its time its actually a very remarkable film. Much of this is because the prints were hand painted--making Annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance. Ive actually seen two different versions--one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout. I think the red one depicted on the DVD The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance art. And unlike other one minute (or less) films of the day this one is one I could see repeatedly--its just that visually compelling and odd.<br /><br />If you want to see it online there is a 36 second version on Google Video (type in serpentine dance).',pos
'I rented this movie knowing that it would be bad (i have only seen one good Disney sequel and that was toy story 2) but it went far lower than my expectations. I am a die hard disney fan and i just dont believe in sequels with disney movies. For somebody who didnt grow up with the classics (either watching them when they came out or renting them since you were born) its a cute story. I just feel that the plot was dragged out a little too much and was to predictable. The one thing that annoyed me the most was the voices of the girl children of lady and tramp. They were too high pitched. Although most reviews say that it isnt that bad i think that if you are a true disney fan you shouldnt waste your time with this one.<br /><br />Hopefully Disney wont be making any more sequels to any of the other classics any time soon.',neg
'I thought i could see something good but... I am tired after seeing this movie i dont know what i hated the most: the script the acting the FX or the music. Try to picture the worst Power Rangers episode and would still be to kind. Ive seen better FX in FPS Games( The touch with the bone sword or his breath that is making the people disappear in a green smoke is touch of genius) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. I did liked how the women in the car was screaming when the monster was walking around the car (even if shes looking in the wrong way). So give your self a break and dont watch this thing at least call somebody up to see a horror movie with you trust me you will end up playing monopoly for some kicks.',neg
'It seems that several of the people who have reviewed this movie only watched it in the first place because it was filmed near where they live. Hows that for a ringing endorsement? If this movie was filmed near where I lived I wouldnt be mentioning it in my review. It is horrid! Several reviews state that this film is a spoof or tongue-in-cheek horror movie it is neither. It is sad to see this film reviewed as a comedy as that makes it not only a bad attempt at a horror film but as a comedy as well. I did laugh though at how unbelievably bad the film was.<br /><br />This movie has 2 good things going for it the mask and the weapon of choice unfortunately it would have been more interesting watching an hour and a half of the mask and weapon laying on a table then watching this garbage. The social commentary behind the film is also laughable juvenile and stupid. Dont bother with this movie youve already wasted time reading this review dont waste anymore on this movie. Arrggghhh! Its infuriating that movies like this even get made. I was expecting the entire cast a crew to be credited to Alan Smithee a name used when a person usually a director doesnt want to be credited with a movie because its so bad.<br /><br />There is nothing redeeming in this movie I spent $1.19 on the rental and feel I was ripped off. Avoid. 1 out of 10',neg
'If youve seen Atlantis 1 then youd know that what made that film truly great was brilliant animation and a good script. This movie was SO sloppily drawn and animated. The story is also dopey. I was so disappointed in this half-baked drivel that I couldnt make it past the first hour and MAN did I try! The one thing this film had was that it expanded the mole character making him both more sympathetic and three dimensional. Take it from me judge this junk from the cover on the video box. The cover is poorly drawn Disney schlock clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent. If this was a stand alone flick it wouldnt be so bad but riding on the coattails of a brilliant piece like Atlantis makes it utterly inexcuseable.',neg
'This movie ... I saw it 15 years ago and in the last years couldnt remember it any more name or anything else just it was about a Romanian country man played superbly by Anthony Quinn. The impression I got from this drama will be eternal. Finally I found the name of the movie I hope I will be able to buy it. And honestly this movie worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was quite young when I first saw the movie. I asked my friends if they heard about this story but nobody would know anything about Anthony Quinn playing the role of a Romanian peasant. I remember when a German officer came and saw Anthony and told him he was a good breed but in fact the German was cheating on him. For few bucks you wont get rich in case you buy the movie but you will be rich if you have it.',pos

'I watched the movie about 13 yrs ago while living in Airlie Beach Qld Australia. I had found it in the shelves of a little shop in the back that most dont bother to browse.<br /><br />To my pleasure I found it and watched it with the intention of one day owning it and being in my collection. I still do not have it but will one day.<br /><br />I like the concept with the poetry and the fantasy. The semi deserted street scenes with a busy teaming city in the far background added to the visual effect.<br /><br />I have numerous times mentioned this movie to people that enjoy this genre with nothing but praise. It has stuck in my mind and will for a long time to come.<br /><br />I fully recommend this film but only to those that are into this type.<br /><br />This comment and the one from LACA can assist you when choosing to watch this film. The comments may be negative but I found them positive if you look past the derogatory connotation.',pos
'Brilliant thriller deserving far more fame Mitchum and Ryan are awesome in their starring roles as is the entire supporting cast. A truly gripping film noir featuring some wonderfully images and some great dialogue at the heart of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel concerning homophobia this movie attacks post-war anti-emitism and all intolerance and hatred with considerable power. Though parts may seem a little preachy to modern audiences it still has the power to shock and works very well as a thriller in its own right. A credit to all involved.',pos
'Thank goodness for the Coen Brothers. Their success has brought them bigger budgetsbut hasnt rid them of their creativity. I had planned on seeing another movie but it was sold out so I went to this one instead. By the time it began I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious but they dont make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs. The writing is brilliant and delivered with great skill by George Clooney (after this nobody can say hes just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be appreciated on many levels whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I cant remember the last time I saw a movie that was this clever. Ive seen others I would describe as beautiful intriguing funny and charming all of which also describe Oh Brother but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end. You can feel that their journey is building up to something but you cant tell what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us the end is certainly not disappointing. Its surprising and ties up all the loose ends neatly without wearing the story out.',pos
'I had seen this movie long time back but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me.<br /><br />A wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink some Japanese ships at the Singapore harbor during the height of WW2.<br /><br />These commandos are caught in plain-clothes and they are considered to be spies by the Japanese captors. But something happens that hasnt been explored much in any Hollywood WW2 movie that I have seen.<br /><br />A close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives. They begin to respect each other while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers become the best of friends with a senior Japanese prison guard. This is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really tugs your heart.<br /><br />Soon one day as the two friends are conversing the Aussie captain learns that some other captives are going to be tried and executed for the sinking of the Jap ships in the Singapore harbor.<br /><br />He mentions that it was his team and not some others that had sunk the ships to his Japanese friend and upon hearing this the Japanese guard tells him to keep quiet as it might lead to his whole group getting executed. But the captain remains adamant on confessing this to the Japanese authorities.<br /><br />Finally the Japanese authorities sentence them to death in the most respectful way that is according to their rules. This is the Highest Honor accorded to the captured warriors in Japan.<br /><br />This is the most awesome part of the film where the Aussie soldiers are awaiting their imminent death and the tense indecision of the friendly Japanese guard who is still not ready to believe that why did his Aussie friend confess being guilty.<br /><br />I wont give away the ending here. But it is more poignant than one can even imagine and can easily move one to tears.<br /><br />All in all an excellent underrated movie that possibly didnt get the recognition that it deserved internationally. Get one copy today and be mesmerized.',pos

'After reading the novel which is about a one hour read watching this film became a sad disappointing experience. Just as he did in prince of Egypt simon wells somehow managed to direct a script that took away all the drama and mystery out of its source material and turned it into this homogenized nonsense. Now Im a sucker for cheese and camp but this movie made absolutely no sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or any humor. There were no thrills and that silly bookend with addys character of filby throwing his hat in the air was the last hackwriting straw. I felt very violated when this movie was over and I still refuse to believe it was only 90 minutes it went on forever. I wondered how the studio and director could have OKd such a lousy script but then my friend pitched the movie to me exactly as It was and I said wow that sounds great but what happened to the movie.',neg
'(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby B Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters but he hasnt been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasnt been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesnt go to college he will have no future. Several of Bartlebys friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to. To satisfy their parents Bartleby comes up with an idea to start his own college with an internet site. They convert an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However the web site states that we accept anyone. On the first day of school they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students that were also rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in tuition money Bartleby must make his fake college into a functioning one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as the College Dean. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum make their own rules and party all night.<br /><br />(My Comment) The premise of starting a college without a teaching staff is a little off the wall. Since it was a fake college Bartleby really didnt need a staff. The movie reminded me of the classic movie Animal House the college setting the fraternity lots of gags and pretty young women. These new college freshmen had a different notion of what the college experience was all about. The movie not only has lots of humor it also has a good message for life. People should reach for their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do. The ending was a little unrealistic but it is only a movie. The movie was made for the young crowd to have a little fun. (Universal Pictures Run time 1:32 Rated PG-13) (7/10)',pos
'I first saw this film when i was about 13. It blew me away then and in many respects it still does now. But i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now. There is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism - and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it. What we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one side beko and woods in 3D panoramic rainbow vision - on the other two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil.<br /><br />This all makes for a great film story but it worries me that people see the portrayal as accurate.',pos
'Snow White which just came out in Locarno where I had the chance to see it of course refers to the world famous fairy tale. And it also refers to coke. In the end real snow of the Swiss Alps plays its part as well.<br /><br />Thus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film. There is a lot of dope on scene and there is also a pale dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescue.<br /><br />But: Its not a fairy tale. Its supposed to be a realistic drama located in Zurich Switzerland (according to the Tagline).<br /><br />Technically the movie is close to perfect. Unfortunately a weak plot foreseeable dialogs a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting dont add up to create authenticity. Thus as a spectator I remained untouched.<br /><br />And then there were the clichés which drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them because they were so busy all the time. Her best girlfriend on the other hand has loving and caring parents. They (a steelworker and a housewife) live in a tiny flat poor and happy - and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in. The good guy (= prince) is a musician (!) from the French speaking part of Switzerland (which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country). He has problems with his parents. They are migrants from Spain who dont seem to accept his wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed.<br /><br />And so it goes on: Naturally the drug dealer is brutal the bankers are heartless the club owner is a playboy and the photographer although a woman (!) has only her career in mind when she exposes Snow White in artsy pornographic pictures at a show.<br /><br />This review doesnt need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot. As I like other films by Samir e.g. Forget Baghdad I was quite disappointed. Lets hope for the next one.',neg
'Was it really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in a documentary. And why all the silly dog scenes and then repetition of all the same silly dog scenes? This film starts with a great promise - to expose the international politics and the business of wine. It got off to a great start and included all the right characters. But the production is a mess. Points started and developed most of the way then never finished or left with dangling ends. Very poor and disorienting camera work and editing. They should have used subtitles for the British mumbler from Christies.<br /><br />Too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentary.<br /><br />Probably honored at Cannes because of the US bashing (although in my opinion there was too little of it).<br /><br />We left at the 2:00 hour mark - I have no idea how much longer it ran on.',neg
'Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy. Alec Baldwin who was an up and coming star when the film was made is a hoot. Dean Stockwell in a sendup of John Gotti is hysterical. But Mercedes Ruehl as the paranoid and over the top Connie steals the movie.<br /><br />Jonathan Demme previously known for wacky comedies like Something Wild and Melvin and Howard-proves once again that he is a genius. I was not surprised at all when he went on to win the Oscar for directing Silence of The Lambs. The performances he evokes from his actors in Married are inspired and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly ride.<br /><br />One of the cutest most endearing films of the 80s it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era.',pos
'I absolutely could not believe the levels of ineptitude on display in this production. I honestly thought gay men had better taste than this. I know I do.<br /><br />The bulk of the blame doesnt lie with the cast but lets get them out of the way first...the only one with real talent was Joe Souza (plus he had the best bod in the cast). He had a nice clear theatre-style voice. Okay and Jaymes Hodges voice was so-so but he had a vacant expression in every number. The rest couldnt hold a note in a bucket even though the music was obviously dubbed in after the fact. Must have been really dreadful hearing them live. They were also all girly-boys except for maybe three. If I wanted to see naked WOMEN onstage I could go to the titty bars. Not sure why anyone would choose to film the L.A. production instead of New York. I would imagine NY has more readily available singing talent though one would think in L.A. they would be able to find better-LOOKING guys. Apparently not.<br /><br />But I digress...the real blame here lies with the creators and producers. This score was the most banal insipid tripe I have ever heard. It sounded like some theatre queens took all their musical cds threw them in a blender and poured the goo onto a page. Sadly Im sure there are many who cant tell the difference between good theatre writing and whatever this is. I mean seriously I was laughing my ass off through the whole thing but not at the lame jokes. I think the morbid my-lover-has-died-of-AIDS-song entitled Kris Look What Youve Missed was the most hysterical thing in the whole show. Genius writing...Kris / Missed...wow...they ALMOST rhyme...must be a good lyric. And Jesus...the END of that song...Oh Kris Ohhh Kris OHHHH Kris... OVER AND OVER!!! My other favorite was You gotta be a Pumpy Junkie Boy to be a Humpy Hunkie Boy...WTF??? The whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics JUST BECAUSE they rhymed. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently they listened to Sondheim and said Hes not so great I can do that...as evidenced by the retarded Bobby Bobby Bobby reference from COMPANY in one song. Another irk: why are 20-somethings singing about Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Obviously coming from the mouths of the lyricists and not the actors...again bad writing.<br /><br />If you love torture and pain and I know many of you strange fetishists do go ahead and watch it. But youve been warned.',neg
'This movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-shifting limits of mores race relations and desire. Granted it is not a movie for everyone. There are no car chases no buildings exploding no murders. The drama lies in the tension suggested by glances minimal gestures spatial boundaries lighting and things left -- sometimes very ostensibly -- unsaid. Its about identity memory community belonging. The different parts of the movie work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other identity desire limits and loss. It will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer. It will displease those whose palates require explosive massive spicy action. It is a beautifully filmed human story. That is all.',pos
'I love this movie/short thing. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite parts are The French Song and in the opening title when the spatula soldier yells  SPOONS! I crack up every time. I would recommend this movie to Knox Klaymation fans and people who enjoy Jason Steeles other movies. His style of animation is very original. It takes a few views to notice the detailed backgrounds. His humor is also hilarious and is definitely not something youd hear before. Like Max the deformed Spatula who has a sound and light system in his head that beams colorful lights and happy music whenever he talks about his miserable life. This is a wonderful animation to watch anytime any where.',pos
'Jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts - one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budget/box office ones. Its a mere 70 minutes and doesnt feature many sets and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star of course. <br /><br />Stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the Mexican desert. The majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help. Some psychological battling there. <br /><br />Its a surprisingly effective little movie - its short length makes it taut and that Stanwyck is great should go without mention (but Ill still praise her every time).',pos
'I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in. But if youre expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it. This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. Its sickening.<br /><br />Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship. He tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple. Its revolting.<br /><br />I dont see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles.',neg
'I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that Im glad that I had the option to fast forward. The shark itself is ok. Its appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1 (I gave it a 2). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable. I wasnt expecting much but I was continually surprised by this suckfest. Antonio Sabato Jr. is some kind of biologist or scientist or something I wasnt really paying attention. He goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark took out of course. By the way all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater. First of all if they are just going down to find out what happened to this station whats with all the huge tranquilizer darts and the harpoons and stuff. Are these things that you normally carry with you when investigating a accident. The shark theory was advanced by Antonio while on the way so it not like they went in knowing what they were up against. Antonio and this young college student horrible actress by the way just jump to the controls of the sub when the sub is in trouble. What is with that? Unless everyone is getting some kind of sub training before leaving high school I find this a little silly. The director seems to think that if crew members are working in the background then it is a good idea to put someone welding in the background. Metal crafting is very important when your on a sub I guess. Anyway I could go on but Ive said too much already. Bottom Line: Go to your local video store rent this video and then destroy it. Then send email asking IMDB to remove all record of this movie from their site. All memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed. We can do it if we work together.',neg
'Allow me to start this review by saying this: I love vampire movies. They can suck (har har pun intended) and Ill still love them because vampires are just cool in movies. Van Helsing considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap was enjoyable to me because of the fact that there were vampires. You may ask: What does that have to do with this movie? The answer is that I intend to inform you of how horrible this movie truly is that even a sucker (harharhar) for vampire movies like me can despise a movie like this so much.<br /><br />The movie stars Van Helsing a college professor guy who isnt at all convincing. Hes a terrible actor like everyone else in this movie and he wrote it to add salt to the wound. I honestly to not mean to offend him and Im sure everyone had fun making this movie but watching it was actually painful. Im not sure why I watched the whole thing; perhaps it was a morbid fascination like watching an impending train crash: its horrible but you cant manage to force yourself to look away. Its main fault is that its just so ****ing boring and its plot is so damn ridiculous even for a science fiction horror movie.<br /><br />But I digress. By the way Van Helsing has sex with his mom. Of course he doesnt know its her at the time; he just thinks its one of his students (which is still illegal and all but not as disgusting and creepy).<br /><br />If I were Van Helsing I would at least pull an Oedipus myself when I found out I had done something so gross. It wouldve made for one entertaining thing if he just made some comment on it but no. The point isnt even brought up at all by any of the characters. Its as if the writer didnt even think of it. I wouldve at least had another character laugh at him and say Ha ha you had sex with your mom which would be mildly humorous (although blatantly immature). Im probably running out of room so a few more words to dissuade you from ever seeing this film: theres a vampire ninja fight with an old man. It would be funny but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. Its not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is. Stay far far away from it if you value your time at all.<br /><br />I will say one thing positive about the movie: the guy who plays Van Helsing is pretty slick with that knife of his. Theres like a minute long segment where he swings around his knife and actually does some pretty nifty tricks. It would be boring in any other movie but here sadly it was the highlight.',neg
'Right on Colmyster. I totally concur with all your sentiments and add these. I came to my PC especially to post a comment on this dreadful (minus)Bgrade movie. I was going to say that in this day and age I am at a loss to comprehend how anyone could possibly make such a woeful movie - but you beat me to it. Anyone reading this and Colmysters comment trust me ---- DONt waste you time and money. Its an absolute shocker. The acting is totally pathetic the script is way worse and the (so called) special effects are a joke. Surely no-one actually invested money to make this movie? I really cannot think of anything else to say about this so called horror sci-fi product but must pad this commentary to make 10 lines of comment in order to have it accepted for submission.',neg

No wonder Left Wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie; its right up his political alley too.<br /><br />Unlike the reviewers here I am glad Judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained not preached the heavy-handed Liberal agenda.',neg

Anyway about 3 months ago I rented this one. I watched it all the way through...and cried profusely. This is one of those movies that is so freakin bad it makes you want to puke. It actually put a sick feeling in my stomach. Ive seen lots of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000 anyone?) but this one takes the cake. The plot was hard to follow the lighting horrible and the sounds almost inaudible. If there was a negative rating on the scale here this movie would be at -11 for me. This may seem odd but I highly recommend it. Its something you have to see for yourself...but dont say I didnt warn you.

'I think that saying this film has too many is not what makes this film bad. The twists are not the problem of the film. The story is quite clever and could have been very cool if filmed right. The major problems why everyone is complaining about the twists in the film is that the film is just not fascinating enough to make people follow them. The film is badly shot (at least in comparison to its genre brother Lock Stock). Worse: the characters are (although often well acted) just plain flat. The characters dont have enough time to be introduced well enough to let the viewer get involved with a single one of them let alone understand them. Oh and the locations are just terrible: locations-person (I didnt bother to watch the credits for your name) - get another job (maybe still photography or interior design)',neg
'Before the release of George Romeros genre-defining Night of the Living Dead zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. They certainly had much better table-manners in the old days. But social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie-going public? Judging by this film none whatsoever.<br /><br />The story is about an expedition to Cambodia whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication. One of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army.<br /><br />This film is basically a love triangle with zombies. But seeing as this is a 30s movie the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh-eating variety we think of today. They seem to respond to mind-control rather than insatiable appetites. And quite frankly the revolt is somewhat underwhelming too. The whole thing is really very dull. Aside from the lack of horror there isnt any over-the-top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that this couldve provided much entertainment even 70 years ago. See it if you have to see everything with zombie in the title but otherwise I would advise skipping this one.',neg
'Every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden done this again. I always felt theBg Cill was the anthem of its age and he has managed to do it again in Grand Canyon. Every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it. This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice. The juxtaposing of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius. I have watched this film a number of times and am constanly surprised at how deep the emotions run through this film. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline do their roles with great tenderness and Stever Martins portrayal of a movie exec is priceless. Thank you again Mr. Kasden',pos
'This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasnt for the blood and profanity this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrooks (President) talents were never realized in this movie. Shatners acting is okay. The production values in this movie leave a lot to be desired. Overall I think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair.',neg
'As with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the 2 lead characters. But whilst C + J eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood this pair revel in their carnality even to the point of exploring homoeroticism. Most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partners and yet despite their deeply un-PC behaviour everyone emerges smiling. Like C + G through it all they remain innocents at heart rebels against the quotidien the bourgeois the restrictive. As someone else has commented I wouldnt want to know these 2 and its a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy (and what there is of that cannot be laid at their door) and thus for that reason it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth. Dare I say that only the French can get away with films like this. And that is part of their genius.',pos
'I was so moved by this film in 1981 I went back to the theater four times to see it again! Something I have never done for another film. No movie evokes the feelings of growing up in the 60s like Four Friends. That it so closely approximated my own experiences in the 60s is probably something that many will share. Jodi Thelen is radiantly beautiful and unforgetable! Why she didnt become a major star after this I will never know. The acting by the entire cast is flawless as is Steve Tischs script. I always wanted to know how much of the story was autobiographical. But alas Steve is no longer here to answer that question. I have all but worn out my VHS copy of this great movie! Highly recommended!',pos
'When I first saw this movie in the theater I was so angry. It completely blew in my opinion. I didnt see it for a decade then decided what the hell lets see. Im watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong. My guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff oh noes what is happening oh its a dream oh its not a dream oh wait i see something spooky oh never mind-sucky storyline. Those sequels dont even require the box to be opened or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead. The first 3 hellraisers sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place. Nothing fantasy nothing weird the box got opened boom they came. Kirstey was the only one that could bargain her way out of it first because of uncle Frank. Then because she had information about the cenobites. This movie at least attempts to stick to all that even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser. No Im pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series. Now they are remaking 1 and I dont even think I will watch it. Oh who am I kidding I probably will and probably will be disappointed.... again.',neg
'Working girl Kitty (Sothern) is engaged to Bill (Kelly) who neglects her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage. After being stood up on her birthday Kitty goes on a double-date/blind date where she meets department store heir Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). She falls in love but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress rather than his wife. Faithful Bill rallies round to comfort her and at last she gives in to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement pressured in part by Bills support of her family after she loses her job. When Bob returns however convinced that he wants marriage after all will Kitty follow her heart or her conscience? <br /><br />This film was a lot better than Id expected it to be. The character of Bill at first comes off as the sort of loud comic Irishman type that Jack Carson played so often. But Kelly (and the script) infuse the character with real compassion and love and Bill turns out to be the best person in the entire group. Viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless Hartwell! The tone of the film wavers however between light-hearted romance and a much darker side especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at Bills garage.<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by the dependable Jane Darwell as Kittys mother an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious Mickey Rooney as Kittys younger brother and Spencer Charters as Kittys neer-do-well father.',pos
'After wasting 2 hours of my life watching this movie on late night television I went back and reread some of the IMDb material to remind myself of why I watched it in the first place. In hindsight the only thing that I can think of is that the genre generally appeals to me. But this movie was a total waste of effort. It fails on every level and to see that its described on IMDb as a comedy really leaves me at a loss. I dont recall more than a couple of chuckles. There are more laughs in any episode of Law and Order than in The Last Man. Seriously.<br /><br />Too much of the characters interaction just didnt seem to me to have any foundation and was therefore very unlikely/unbelievable.<br /><br />If it hadnt been for the almost-gratuitous bikini shots well what can I say? Avoid this movie like the plague. Or tape it and just fast forward to the bikini shots. Do not spend even $1 to rent it though.',neg
'Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. The plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. There are of course complications. The problem with the film for me is that it hasnt aged well. Performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. One late exchange where Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery. There are other times when the film becomes static a sign of the limitations of the microphones. Its not a bad film its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment. Normally Im forgiving but this time out I just couldnt go with the flow (Then again the copy I saw was absolutely horrible). Worth a shot in a forgiving mood (and to be reminded that Robert Armstrong actually did more than play Carl Denham in King Kong)',neg
'Spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film (so not really spoiler after all). Saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it. Its all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town. It more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them a couple where the wife is especially wicked. She lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert. We never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply. She is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor - but thats another story which I dont remember too good. The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really wicked woman on film who pretends to be anything but wicked - cant be compared with the witch in Snowwhite who in comparison is easy to find out. Very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing.',pos
'I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. Its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy way.<br /><br />Gael is absolutely terrible I mean he just cannot act period. He should give up now as acting is clearly not his thing.. His co-stars are about the same caliber im sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them! The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous.. Somehow I dont think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy.<br /><br />I have never written a comment on IMDb but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to do so.<br /><br />If you get the chance to see this film dont 0/10 if there was a 0',neg
'I was very disappointed in this film. The director has shown some talent in his other endeavors but this just seemed to be filler. There may have been a deep meaning behind it but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys.<br /><br />I would highly recommend his other works to people but certainly not this one. As I watched it I kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period but it never did. At the end of the movie I was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way. I could only say to myself What was that?<br /><br />There were a few really striking parts of the film but not enough to warrant sitting through it again.',neg
'Great horror comedy from Michael Davis.Iwas laughing so hard i almost peed! Great acting from Eric Jungman as the good guy who saves the day & great performance by the Jack Black-esquire like performance from Justin Urich. He was just divine in this film. This guy deserves to be a big star. AlsoAimee Brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger along with the guys from a killer reminiscent of Jeepers Creepers. The gore to was given in copious amounts & i loved it.I just hope they release a not rated version. Great low-budget Horror Comedy. The dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just gruesomely funny! ***** out of *****',pos
'Strangely this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Aided by hindsight Crowes screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than Amenabars original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first but theres no doubt that Crowe has improved on it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. Thats what i mean by more fleshed out.',pos

'An MTV-style film crew consisting of American T.V. programme producer Zack Zardine (Matt Borlenghi) his camerawoman the Australian Cecily (Kate Fisher) and two surfer dudes named Bog Hall (Dax Miller) and Jeremy (Joel West) arrive on some nice looking island somewhere its not actually revealed where. The crew plan to shoot an expose on bloodsurfing which is apparently the latest craze in extreme sports. Surfers throw bait into the sea and cut themselves to attract sharks just to see if they can out-surf them without being eaten. Once there they are greeted by Sonny Lofranco (Cris Vertido) and his wife Melba (Susan Africa). Their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark infested waters of Lilo-Cay. Sonny Melba and their daughter Lemmya (Maureen Larrazabal) take them in their boat. Soon after arriving and having already shot some bloodsurfing footage Sonny Melba and Lemmya are all killed by a 30 foot saltwater crocodile that some say owns the island. The boat is sunk. Zack Cecily Bog and Jeremy appear stuck on the island until such time a rescue party arrives. However after a run in with some erm well I dont really know what they are. Pirates? Drug smugglers? Revolutionairies? Fat ugly people who just dont like being with other people? Who knows? And more importantly who cares? Not me thats for sure. Anyway after escaping from these guys who look like pirates they are picked up just off the coast of the island by Captain John Dirks (Duncan Regehr) and his girl Arty (Taryn Reif as Tara Reif). The film crew believe they have been saved. Little do they know that the crocodile and Captain Dirks go way back and he has a score to settle and four members of a film crew arent going to stop him. Captain Dirks heads back to Lilo-Cay for a final showdown with the giant man-eating crocodile.<br /><br />Directed by James D.R. Hickox this is one awful film but its still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers Crocodile (2000). Everything about this film sucks. The script by Sam Bernard and Robert L.Levy is terrible extremely slow as the crocodile isnt even seen or mentioned before the 30 minute mark and by that time I was seriously bored and annoyed with the hideously unlikeable characters thought up by Bernard and Levy. The whole film is also frustratingly predictable as well within the first 10 minutes anyone familiar with horror film stereotypes and stock characters will be able to guess who dies and who will survive. The crocodile effects are awful and seem to be repeated over and over there is a small puppet head that obviously has someones arm stuck inside it controlling its movements as the water splashes become huge! The CGI shots of the crocodile are just plain embarrassing to watch. There is no gore apart from when a character is bitten in half which is achieved using CGI to digitally remove the actors legs again it looks terrible. There is also a brief scene when someone is impaled on wooden spikes when they set a trap off. There is a reasonable amount of nudity and sex plus the female actresses are nice and easy on the eye. There are basic continuity and logical errors in the film too in one sequence Cecily is filming Bog and Jeremy bloodsurfing but from the angle and distance she is at it would be physically impossible to obtain footage of both the sharks and surfers at the same time and surely that is the whole point of her shot? When Dirks manages to harpoon the crocodile the angle of the wire changes dramatically between shots in one shot the angle of the line looks like its coming from the sky in the shot straight after the angle is completely different and it seems as if the line is coming from below the surface of the water when in actual fact the harpoon is attached to the back of the boat and the line should be almost level with the surface. I could carry on like why does the crocodile jump off the edge of a cliff if its so smart as this film tries to make out? But I would probably exceed the 1000 word limit if I listed everything that was wrong with this film so I wont. I hated this film but rather scarily its still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers effort at a giant crocodile film. Definitely one to avoid.',neg
'Well to answer one personss question of why doesnt anyone remember this film? its because reallynot that many people saw it in 1978 and its not been shown much on TV since. (If its on video thatd be news to me!) Even in the era of sometimes mindless comedies that was the 70smovie-goers had the smarts to avoid this film. Unless they love Billy CrytalPaul Lynde or Joan Rivers that much! <br /><br />Paul Lynde was funnier on Bewitched or Hollywood Squares than here. Joan Rivers at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel jokes about singer Karen Carpenters lack of weight! Har-har Joan! It also seems like every somewhat famous name from the era is in the cast. (Most surprising is Doris Roberts later of Everybody Loves Raymond.)<br /><br />Anyhowa somewhat good idea for a storylinea man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here. With help from a male friend Crystal gets set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity but because she was on top instead of himhe gets pregnant! (A commentary on women taking positions of power away from men).<br /><br />Crystals stomach growshe goes through all the female emotions and related feelings. Unfortunatelyhe is now a socially misunderstood outcast! Hes attacked by a mob who wants him rubbed out (I guess).<br /><br />Hes forced to go into seclusion to have his baby...in a barn. Or if you willa manger (God only knows where it may have exited from! Ewwww!) It turns out (no shock here) to be a girl! <br /><br />Everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettablethe humor is high school level or less.<br /><br />2 stars for a good idea and a few good touching & relevant moments w/ Billy Crystal.

'This is one of those films that you watch with a group of people. You will have the best time. Its really really bad like Showgirls bad but without the quality of Showgirls.<br /><br />Youve got the best mix of bad actors bad director and bad script here. Everything that can possible be wrong that can make for an entertaining evening you have here. The first being the tag line is a bunch of teenagers... These people are as much teenagers as my grandmother.<br /><br />The director has zero sense of suspense or tension. The 30 year old teenagers are standing around and the monster comes out and attacks and this pretty much happens throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed. There is no suspense building up to this or surprise or anything. Its more like when you were kids pretending to be chased by monsters and just kind of made up stuff as you went. And when I use the word monsters I exaggerate. More like a couple guys in Halloween masks bought at the .99 cent store.<br /><br />There is no doubt this script was spun off in a couple days no rewrites and I can only imagine how bad and poorly formatted it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur with no clue. Its another example of one of the bad things about this day and age: anyone can make a movie.<br /><br />But of course the best bad thing about this film is the acting. Its as bad as you can get. There isnt one person in this who has the slightest skill at acting and the lead is the absolute worst. He delivers every line in this monotone manner without any expression and you have to wonder how someone this bad could possible get a part in any movie no matter who he knows. When he had to cry when his girlfriend was killed it was one of the funniest scenes Ive ever seen in a movie. Watching these people reciting some of the awful dialog is very very funny. But when the black guy said tell her...tell her...I love her... before his death scene there was a huge laugh among our group. Funny funny stuff.<br /><br />My only hope is this movie gets bad enough ratings to take its place where it belongs: in the IMDb lowest rating 100 movies. We can do it folks!<br /><br />PS. Is it any surprise that the one great comment this movie got in here was from someone in Virginia (who has one comment only on this movie and nothing else). And guess where the movie was made? Virginia. Ive said it before and Ill say it again: people who work on the movie should NOT be allowed to comment on it.',neg
'Going by the good words of my friends I hired this movie hoping that it would at least equal the laughs of the similar movie House Party but I was very disappointed and very bored.<br /><br />Falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign. I dont know whether this didnt appeal to me because I dont live in da hood or if Im not black but its probably one of the two.<br /><br />It tries to spoof a few movies only coming up with a couple of laughs but in the long run it fails miserably.

'Despite the other comments listed here this is probably the best Dirty Harry movie made; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the countrys socio-political feelings during the Reagan glory years of the early 80s. Its also a kickass action movie.<br /><br />Opening with a liberal female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene which prompts the famous Go ahead make my day line) Sudden Impact is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film. The first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome Inspector Callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood. It gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for Callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past. Superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the 80s.',pos
'I was REALLY disappointed with this movie. I had heard some great reviews about it and unfortunately missed seeing it in theaters. As a result of this I was really excited to see it when it came to DVD. I thought that it was going to be a high-paced horror movie with a lot of scary surprises but instead it was a snail-paced predictable movie. It dragged and dragged without a climax in it and after all the difficulties that those people went through to try and escape the ending was completely frustrating. I gave this movie two stars for one reason. This is not your typical horror movie with one central bad guy slashing a bunch of people to death. The story makes this movie unique and provides a change for people who watch a lot of horror movies. Even though I dont like this movie I recommend that all horror fans do see it at least once. You may surprisingly like it. As for this horror fan all I can say is that I hope there ISNT a sequel to this forgettable movie.',neg
'Arguebly Al Pacinos best role. He plays Tony Montana A small time hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami and he does it with the only two things hes got in this world his balls and his word and he doesnt breakem for nobody. Starts as doing jobs for a big time Cuban dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the bosss sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tonys young sister. Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalmas Brightest points in his long ups and downs career you can see this guy is very talented. The movie has a magnificent look to it. Also pay attention for two memorable scenes: The one at the fancy restaurant (Say goodnight to the bad guy). the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies its a must-see. For the rest of you its highly recommended. 10/10',pos
'I give this movie 3 out of 10 because I have watched zillions of movies and I can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like. Definitely The Broken is not one of those movies. I have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations Ive read in prior comments they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people. the photo on the cover clearly shows that the Broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain. Its a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless. So you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before. Though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue. Had the clues been planted more in the movie one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed. But though the movie was so slow in pace it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all. And the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil Gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments. Furthermore if Gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end then how come she is the evil one? I bet I can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion: This movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time. Obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all. I am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies. Horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages! Theyre supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest I guess. Horror movies should have blood screams intensity skeletons body organs and parts. Because that is the real horror and its never away from reality. I have watched almost all horror movies and I can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising. Nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of. For instance the horror movie Train with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with Hostel it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them.<br /><br />And even if we considered the Broken a movie that has an existential message it is still very poorly presented and the least scary. I prefer the addiction message presented in Requiem for a Dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex TV safety/being pampered etc... can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me. And those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply dont like this genre but this doesnt mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils ecstasy leadership lessons (believe it or not!) entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life as ugly and scary as it may seems Death!',neg
'Stay FAR AWAY from this film. The fact that youre reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys. This is a truely horrid movie... so lets get down to the problems. Writing and Direction: It wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive gradeschoolers that watched scream and I know what you did last summer a few too many times. GIANT GAPING plot holes abound; while I cant congratulate them for this movie its nice knowing theyre finally potty trained. Actors(or lack thereof): Only the finest for this film... the finest extras ever to grace a screen now starring in their speaking role debut! As a disclaimer I have to note that I am capable of watching and enjoying just about anything. I recognize a good movie when I see it but I can still giggle and smirk during Bubble Boy (yes folks its true); so when I say to avoid something you KNOW Im not kidding.',neg

Why was there so much sand that was put to so little use? Where was there so much table slapping? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy who he was shooting archery with? Did he realize the man was Japanese? Why was no no credible excuse given for Connerys accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent whether it be being raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact) being raised on the bayou in Louisiana (Universal Soldier) or having a French mother and being raised in Indochina (I cannot even remember the name of that movie)?

'Caribe is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes one of them embedding the other each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great and for that we owe credit to the emerging director Esteban Ramírez. Furthermore the characters are very well written and masterfully complex; so once you become familiarized with them you can perceive their feelings without them even saying anything. I cant say I liked this picture because of all the hype it generated(in Costa Rica) but rather because of the way it really achieves in showing an interesting portrait of what happens when you interfere with the equilibrium of peoples lives. Hopefully Caribe will establish a reference for future projects in Costa Rica as it is a very good example of nice movie making.',pos
'Where to begin theres so much wrong and horrible about this movie I am not sure where to start. Okay the two stooges who wrote this crapper. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton first they couldnt make up their so-called minds for a name. My guess they split the difference thats why the main title is BRAIN THAT WOULDNT DIE but the end screen says HEAD THAT WOULDNT DIE. Neither one knows anything about the Medical profession. After all Doctors take oaths to do no harm. Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered harm. Plus a little thing called blood and tissue matching. Rejection would spell death for Jan in the pan. Plus who keeps a patch work monster. What medical school did Bill graduate from FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name that bugs the hell out of me. Plus the brilliant surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner doesnt know how to keep a patient sedated? All and all a disaster of a movie its incredibly stupid and unwatchable except on MST3K. I give it THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY.',neg
'Stealing is a crime and these guys Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get away with it. I havent even seen this film but not only do i know it sucks but the fact that it steals the story of another film or 2 films for that matter is such bull crap (and if IMDb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap) that I become filled with rage and feel as though I should just throw myself out the window and just end it all. O.k thats a little much but stealing is worse.<br /><br />Ever seen Pontypool? It was this awesome little zombie film made in 2008 this radio host goes into work and then this zombie attack happens. We only see whats going on inside the radio station and the only guess we have on whats happening on the outside are the occasional calls from their eye in the sky Ken Loney (easily the funniest moment in the film in my mind) and the BBC calling in for an update on the situation. From all the reviews Ive read and from the conversation I had with my friend (who has seen this film and Pontypool) this film was exactly like it in the story with minor tweaks here and there. So throw originality and creativity out the window. As for the Zombies or the infected whatever you want to call them. They are the exact same thing just because they got infected does not change the fact that they walk around mindlessly and have a never ending quench for flesh. They are Zombies. ZOMBIES!!<br /><br />ZOMBIES!!! Okay one to many but back to this crappy movie. The Zombies from what Ive heard are a lot like the ones in 28 Days Later another better movie with their insane rage and even more insane quench of flesh. This is where Zombie movies define themselves story does not matter in a zombie movie (as long as your not taking the idea of another film). Sure a zombie movie can be enhanced by the story as is the case with Pontypool but the zombies have to be in a way original. 28 Days Later started the insane raging Zombie. Pontypool I cant even begin to explain those guys without ruining the film. The Evil Dead I think all i have to do is just type the name again because come on its The Evil Dead. Romero is the master and he went through all different types of zombies from the painted face zombies in Dawn of the Dead to raging zombies in Diary of the Dead and he did each one with his own unique style.<br /><br />So after talking about other great zombie movies I think its about time I explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This movie down right steals the original story outline to Pontypool which i think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people get kicked out of school for doing this very thing yet in Hollywood its allowed and apparently approved of. This is not the only film that takes the outline of another movie and just tries to tell it differently. The 90s is like the worst period for movies ever sure it had some gems but what decade doesnt and its because all the movies were the exact same. My favorite the crime movie with a twist so big that youll never guess it till the very end. They force feed you one suspect make it seem impossible that its not anybody else but him then bam all this time it was this guy you just had to look at the scenes where he wasnt there and then when he would mysteriously show up out of the blue say hey guys what did i miss? OH! DIDNT SEE THAT COMING DID YA! Well Ill leave a cliché as my closing statement. This is one film youll surely want to miss.',neg
'In a lot of ways this film defines the essence of everything I love about cinema in terms of capturing those strange elusive moments of unguarded truth. In other ways it is undeniably an amateurish unfocused result of junkies self-indulgently fooling around with a camera. Ultimately it comes out somewhere between pure brilliance and unwatchability (thankfully much more so the former than the latter). Part of me wants to reward it solely for its absolute innovativeness and moments of pure sublimity but at the same time I cant completely ignore the occasionally downright awful acting and overtly bad production values. At first the editing seems overwhelmingly sloppy and needlessly distracting (or maybe just wrongheadedly innovative) but after a while I got used to it which is in the end the true sign of whether a film succeeds on its own terms or not. I guess that answer basically sums up my all-around feelings for the film. That is despite its in-ignorable flaws on a whole it does work very well. And if nothing else a film like this really shows how false and contrived the faux-documentary shaky-cam style can sometimes be when it so obviously applied purely for effect (such as in films like the otherwise admirable Roger Dodger). Here the aesthetics are plainly derived from the necessities of the filming situation and are not just used arbitrarily to make it look cool.',pos
'The headline describes it exactly. This dribble of a film was nothing more than the typical group of teens killed someone accidentally now that someone is haunting/killing them off 20 years later crap that has been shoved down our throats for decades. The only twist is instead of an angry ex-classmate or lovable psycho/loser it was a nun. Nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls blah blah girls accidentally/purposely drown the nun blah blah nun haunts the girls people die movie ends. The only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes which were pretty cool (especially the one with the elevator door ripping off this fat ladys arms) but even they couldnt make this a great movie. Brian Yuzna should hang his head for attaching himself to this refuse. Im sure glad I rented it and didnt buy it or Id be furious beyond belief. If you want a nunsploitation flick to please the senses go watch Demonia or something. Stay away from this garbage.',neg
'The year is 1964. Ernesto Che Guevara having been a Cuban citizen for the last five yearsdisappears from the face of the Earthleaving a glum Fidel Castro to announce that he is probably deadwhen in truth he has left Cuba to move to Bolivia to live an assumed identity. Whilst living in La PazGuevara undertakes an idea to overthrow the corruptbourgeois government there. Once againSteven Soderberg takes up where Che:Part One leaves off (only better this time). The pacing is more on targetthe job of acting is ever so fine (including a turn by a sickly looking Benecio Del Toroas Che Guevara). Suffice it to sayits probably best if you see both filmsto get the true story of Guevara & what kind of a man he was (I had the rare open window of opportunity to see both films at one screening----talk about a long haul!). As with Che-Part 1:The Argentinethis film has no MPAA rating but contains enough salty language & violence to easily snag it an R.',pos
'I cant honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you cant really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital  he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague  he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession  he turns into a werewolf  hes visited by apparitions of his dead victims  etc etc . and reading the previous line Ive just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is <br /><br />With this Paris based movie theres no scenes that really stand out . Theres no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how hes going to get back home with no money or clothes  theres no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and theres no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour ? Im thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone hes got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that theres no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonists fate and dilemma in the London movie  here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . Theres also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then arent large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the worlds press ? Why havent the police got leads ?<br /><br />Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower  its painfully obvious that its achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I wont put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair its reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didnt stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didnt need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment',neg
'I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition. We loved everything about it: the time the romance the battle scenes the villains etc.<br /><br />Come on who can resist hating that psycho Bent with his constant SIR!? Classic! Moreover who can resist cheering wildly when Justin falls off the balcony?! What a triumphant moment! I always had a special place in my heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. The theme song alone can get me to tear up a little. This movie is incredibly moving and I challenge anyone to stick with it until the very end. Its worth it!!',pos
'I loved this series when it was on Kids WB I didnt believe that there was a Batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First of all I loved the idea of Robin leaving Batman to solve crime on his own. It was an interesting perspective to their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series and once again like its predecessor this show had great story lines great animation (better then the original) fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing. The only thing that I didnt like was that was when it was in the US it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline. I just wish some of the episodes could be longer. My favorite episode of any Batman cartoons comes in this series and its called Over the Edge in my opinion as good if not better then Heart of Ice and Robins reckoning. Overall a nice follow up along with Superman this show made my childhood very happy.',pos
'The comments already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate. I feel exactly the same way that I am very disappointed at how far Rick Mercer has fallen when he used to do some really great things on This Hour Has 22 Minutes but now he is just clowning around going places and talking to people. He does some bits in the studio about things going on in the news but they are never funny at all just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines. Most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people for example this week he is going to a rodeo and the video pieces are all of him making funny faces and acting scared of the wild horses etc. He used to be funny but has gotten way less funny since leaving This Hour Has 22 Minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more. Now that Air Farce is off the air (finally thank goodness!) Mercer and This Hour Has 22 Minutes have got to be next in line for the axe just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny any more. Its sad really considering Rick Mercer used to be the funniest man on Canadian TV!',neg
'Roy Andersson has managed to craft something that defies nearly all conventions of what a film should be a piece of art that is both beautiful funny and evocative at the same time. The end result is a moving if somewhat fractured tale about humanity in its simplest and most honest forms.<br /><br />This is unlikely to appeal to everyone in fact the humour is so finely tuned that many are unlikely to get on its wavelength. The almost absurdly long takes awkward silences and consistent medium shots will most definitely put off even the most willing of audiences. But it is within these disjointed tales and unconventional thinking that Andersson shapes a world where every character seems to take centre stage in their own absurd way. Each scene is absorbed by the desolate environments with the characters seemingly left alone in their own oddity Its a difficult piece to watch at times not least because like many of its scenes it requires patience. But whilst some may hail it upon an artistic throne others will simply look on in confusion. Its a film that blends understated humour with own brand of heart',pos
'Time travel is theoretical so I can give the script some leeway.<br /><br />I also understand the concept that by changing just one variable you can potentially change the way history unfolded.<br /><br />What I cannot understand however is the way the change in time unfolded. We are subjected to a series of timewaves which progressively retrograde planetary evolution. While this is a convenient plot device as it allows our heroes enough time to resolve the problem it makes no sense whatsoever. Surely if you change a variable and that variable has significantly or even completely altered planetary evolution then by the time you come back to the future the evolutionary process has already been established and there would be no need for waves? After all why would a change that happened 65 million years ago need to wait until now to be effective? The fact that the moth was projected forward in time may give it some credibility but the life of that moth 65 million years ago was significantly altered ergo any change to evolutionary history would have begun then and not be dependent upon a return to our current time.<br /><br />To solve the problem the team goes back in time to prevent the change in variable from ever happening. By doing this successfully we see that the changes to evolution never happened and that no-one even remembers the events! Surely what works for the solution should work for the original change? I like a good rollicking sci fi adventure but unless it is set in a galaxy far far away it needs to have at least some grounding in theoretical possibility to make it truly entertaining.<br /><br />Good premise bad plot reasonable acting and in all fairness just a twist on Jurassic Park.<br /><br />Not on my watch again list.',neg
'The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) strips to the music of Joe Cocker: You Can Leave Your Hat On! That was the best part of the whole film. Not because the scene was any good; only the song. I am not saying it was a terribly bad film just not that good. Disappointingly so!<br /><br />Especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded upon. Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust obsession and infatuation and where it can lead to it drags its heels obscurely from one idea to the other. For example when John (played by Rourke) is able to leave her on the top of the Big Wheel Liz (Kim Basinger) is unconvincingly rattled at the bizarre experience courtesy of Johns sense of humor but less rattled at his sexual exploits involving the ever willing Liz; and like one reader mentioned that for a woman to enjoy sex she has to experience the dangerous side is unconvincing. This dangerous side is not exploited enough in the film and one gets a sense of anti-climax from the view point that it all could go horribly wrong. The theme of bondage makes an appearance often but only just takes one to the brink of danger and then all goes well.Is the film sending the message out that this kind of foreplay is FINE! If the film was making a point about the pitfalls of bondage and by extension the ugly ramifications of sad-masochism then maybe it would make a good moral point. Instead the film awkwardly jumps from one sizzling scene of Rourke feeding Basinger and blindfolding her to another. In a film that could have been good it falls flat on its face because it does not expand and extend the themes the film is MAYBE trying to relate; thus for me it doesnt have a plot nor a theme just a mixture of ideas.',neg
'If youre a sane person and you have seen films before then you cannot tolerate this piece of idiocity for more than 20 minutes. And if you do stay there longer then it wont be because youd expect akshay or paresh (not govinda please!) but because you value your money too much and you want at least a short nap on the plush seating in the multiplex in return of the money they robbed you off! Its hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult film like HeraPheri can fall to such levels.. alright hes repetitive but now hes coming out of all third rate storied and expects us to laugh because hes brought in Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar...!No sir this aint going to work now.. especially with this stupid script of yours!Even comedy films can have meaningful scripts (Lage Raho Munnabhai anyone?).<br /><br />Govinda doesnt have much to do so cant comment..Akshay Kumar was boring Paresh Rawal cracked some of the worst joke possible.Lara Dutta had real scope for acting in this one but she fails miserably...the only high point of the film (possibly) is Tanushrees acting!But shes there only for the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />I dont think this film is worth any more space...

'well i may be bias as i grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a DVD copy as a birthday pressie for my Dad. The film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages.... much better than anything Disney ever made in my opinion (and i used to work in the Disney Store!!!). The characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of Swat the fly. and Smack the mosquito) and the amazing night club scene. The musical numbers still have me humming 20 years after i first watched it. there is no other film that i can better recommend whilst baby-sitting and in fact every child i know (thanks to my Hoppity loving parents) have seen this film many times. It will always get top marks for its fabulous love story a brilliant baddy and over all originality.',pos
'Capitães de Abril is a very good. The story isnt a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of how it was like. The fiction of the story isnt of great interest but it doesnt spoil the movie. The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia arent exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for his deeds. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the 25th of April Revolution.<br /><br />All the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully. Lisbon looks beautiful as ever. Dont miss it! I liked this film very much.',pos

'I recently rented this promising mini series I didnt even know they had adapted it for television. I was really looking forward to it since the book Icon is one of the best spy thrillers I have ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot only loosely resembles the one in the book the characters are completely miscast and theres some appalling acting. A shame really. The story behind Icon is perfect for the silver screen but I think television budgets just arent big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book.<br /><br />Forsyth deserves much much better than this. Avoid and stick to the book which is a must-read.',neg
'Ill admit that I dont expect much from a Roger Corman film. Generally I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. Yet in this case I am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The Gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by the spunky Beverly Garland) who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered. Ms. Garland is a pretty good shot herself killing one of the murderers the next day at her husbands funeral. Her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew. The bars owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the (hoped-for) railroad. However Ms. Garland is a thorn in her plans and the bar matron hires a man to kill Ms. Garland.<br /><br />Because of Ms. Garlands plays her role honestly and realistically there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers Shes the Sheriff jokes. With the exception of a couple of faux pas (the apartment door that opens OUT from the inside jeep tracks and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner) the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare. However Corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes much like he does walking in other films.<br /><br />Sterno says The Gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time.',neg

Who doesnt love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what its REALLY like. And who doesnt love hearing the girls bitch about each other and get into fights? Or enjoy wanting to throw something at that Janice lady?<br /><br />Give this a chance. Dont expect something intelligent or a show you can look to for a life lesson. Just enjoy it for what it is.

'This is a story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. The parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house. The father Murray Abromowitz moves with his children to California and moves around Beverly Hills so that his children can get the best education possible.<br /><br />Things really become funny when Marisa Tomei Murrays niece comes to lives with the group.<br /><br />The film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the affluent neighborhood.<br /><br />Jessica Walter costars as a woman who wants Murray to move in with her since she wants a companion.<br /><br />Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come in towards the end. They play Murrays brother and sister-in-law respectively; theyre also the parents of Tomei. In front of the children Reiner lets loose reminding Murray that he has been paying the bills for them all along.<br /><br />The film ends on a sour note as the embarrassed family moves out of their fancy digs and take to riding around Beverly Hills in their car.

'TROMEO & JULIET - 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION<br /><br />William Shakespeares play Romeo & Juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films. Sometimes literally following the original text (which is at times vague in stage directions) sometimes in new interpretations where directors chose to show their own view on the piece. Some are good many are mediocre. Lloyd Kaufmans film certainly stands out as one of the most original modern versions of the bards creation It may be placed in a modern-day decaying New York and full of the modern-day anti-social behavior body piercing dismemberment and kinky sex (which for the more than casual reader Shakespeare himself wasnt shying away from) but at the same time it stays incredibly close to the overall feel and point of what the play is all about which is quite an effort. Kaufman wrote the script with his co-director on the film James Gunn who is now famous for writing two successful Scooby Doo movies doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for Dawn of the Dead and directing one of the best horror-films of the year: Slither. Lloyd Kaufmans innovative directorial view alongside with James Gunns original and unrestricted writing make for an interpretation of Shakespeares play that maybe not everyone will get immediately but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and highly important view on a classic play. With a script that is written entirely in iambic meter appearances of Motorheads Lemmy and an outrageous forceful soundtrack watching Tromeo & Juliet is something no one will ever forget. Apart from its historical significance Tromeo & Juliet is a treasure for film-lovers of all kind. Not only for the script by James Gunn now a good influence on Hollywood while working from the inside but also because it features an early part of legendary actress Debbie Rochon. Well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets. The 10th anniversary edition on DVD adds to all that by including so many as-yet undiscovered gems that not only all the information one could wish for about the film itself and the experience of making it is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the DVD but also a very honest (and disturbing) look is given into the ways independent cinema has to surviver these days. In many ways the extras on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given on Kaufmans film-school Make Your Own Damn Movie. Furtermore historical items from the Troma vaults which include James Gunn Debbie Rochon and all other contributors to this masterpiece are included and the film itself is apart from looking better then ever accompanied by no less than four audio-commentaries each and everyone informative excruciatingly funny and all done for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and nonsensical commentaries that are so common these days. There are new commentaries (one with Kaufman and Gunn together) but also the one James Gunn did for the original release of the DVD but couldnt be included there for some of honesty he displays about some other people is present on this disc. With fan-recreations of a few of the scenes from the film a video diary of Lloyd Kaufmans visit to the set of James Gunns Slither and a visit the two brought together to Eli Roths Hostel Birthday party and much more this is the ultimate set everyone must own. Weather you are a film historian someone interested in interpretations of the great Bards work a fan of great cinema a fighter for independent cinema a fan of James Gunn interested in learning more on making films on a low budget a fan of Lloyd Kaufman or whatever: this is the most important DVD-release of this millennium!',pos

'When HULK hit theaters in 2003 it wasnt long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze. We saw a similar occurrence a year prior when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with that heros big screen debut. Companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brand.<br /><br />So the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of Wal-Mart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I guess everyone involved would just rather forget. To be fair THE FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me rephrase that. Its not as unentertaining as all of its negative reviews might suggest.<br /><br />Veteran television actor Alex Hyde-White (no you dont remember any of his roles) leads the way as Reed Richards the brilliant scientist who along with his crew gains bizarre powers after an outer space mishap. Hes left with the ability to stretch and contort his body to outrageous lengths. His future wife Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) can suddenly turn invisible while her brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) may now ignite himself at will. Then theres poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith) the lovable lug whose body morphs into a mass of craggy orange rock.<br /><br />Just as the friends are becoming accustomed to all of this they are called upon to rescue the world from certain chaos. It seems Reeds old colleague Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) is living up to his name and that villainous Jeweler (Ian Trigger) isnt exactly helping old ladies cross the street either. Can our heroes save the day? Of course they can; like any superhero movie its just a question of how and when.<br /><br />Whats striking about THE FANTASTIC FOUR is how amateurish it is in virtually every aspect. The dialog is so lame and tired it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class. The acting is so unpolished it makes a third-rate afternoon soap opera look like Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good considering the minuscule budget but there are still some positively embarrassing moments. When The Human Torch fully ignites his body for instance the entire movie briefly turns into a cartoon. I can just hear that production meeting. Oh no one will notice. Theyll be too intrigued by the action! I mean really a cartoon? At least give me a mannequin on fire held up by a string! Prior to that the scene in which the foursome come to on earth after their spaceship crashes is pure teens-in-the-backyard fare. The crew simply found a field and lit a vaguely-spaceship-like object on fire. Thats the only remnant of such a major disaster?<br /><br />Of course there wasnt a whole lot to work with in the script. There is a fairly coherent story here but its all so simplified. When Reed and Ben decide to go into outer space they simply drop by the Storms house and ask if theyd care to join them. Is it really that easy? Dont these sort of things require oh I dont know years of training and expertise? Not in the world of these writers who seemed to be inspired by the underrated genius on display in FULL HOUSE reruns. But as bad as that may be nothing can compare to how painfully clichéd Dr. Doom is. He was pulled right out of those awful superhero cartoons from the 1960s right down to the evil laugh and slamming his clenched fist down on the table to punctuate his remarks. No comic book least of all Fantastic Four has ever featured a villain so obscenely one dimensional.<br /><br />Ultimately THE FANTASTIC FOUR is saved from being a complete turkey because its just so damn innocent. You can tell the people involved as little talent or experience as they had really tried. They didnt know the final result would be so embarrassing. They were under the impression that this was their big break that people would flock to the theaters. It bears repeating that they had virtually no money to work with (and Im sure half of that was eaten up by the cool Thing costume). All things considered they did well and for its many flaws the finished product is a fair amount of fun for comic book fans.',neg
'I first saw this film in the late 60s and try to see it every time it comes on TV which unfortunately isnt often. Now that I have TCM and FMC I hope it will be on at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. in An Officer and A Gentleman Jack Webb delivers an unbelievably great performance as a Parris Island Drill Sergeant with the classic screw-up recruit and the story line in this one though dated is touching and very well acted. And having real jar-heads in the cast certainly helped in the realism of the film as well. Its a great film with top-notch acting and a superb story. See it if you have the chance-Its well worth the time!',pos
'As Roger Corman has said in an interview low-budget film-making enables film-makers to take chances on offbeat ideas. Well youd be hard pressed to find a film that thrives on the offbeat as mightily as George Barrys Death Bed: The Bed That Eats.<br /><br />The film does have a back story to it and its an interesting one at that. Ill forgo relaying any sort of details so you can hear them for yourself if you take a chance on watching it. Suffice it to say the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger consuming the unwary with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid.<br /><br />Death Bed is an eerie haunting little flick that plays out its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual assortment of schlock fare. It occupies its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously. Its a truly strange and unconventional horror flick. It dabbles in exploitative ingredients - theres some tasty dollops of female nudity - and yet is also art albeit art with a completely skewed sensibility.<br /><br />The special effects are not too bad for a film with a microscopic budget and Barry gives the film a good and atmospheric midnight movie quality. The acting from the cast is as uninspired as one could imagine although Patrick Spence-Thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist / narrator and one definite point of interest is seeing one familiar face on hand: future Boy Meets World father William Russ!<br /><br />This film might not have even found the small cult following that it does have were it not for pirated copies making the rounds; this certainly has to rank as one of the instances where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the film - even if the exposure took years to take hold.<br /><br />If you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items Death Bed may be just what youve got in mind.<br /><br />7/10',pos
'Like his early masterpiece The Elephant Man Lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight simple story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of an elderly retired man (expertly played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at deaths door. A beautiful score from Badalamenti exquisite photography of rural life (love those aerial corn-field shots) and a sly directors hand that reveals mans basic humanity this is a beautiful slice of life film. Its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end.',pos
'I feel the movie did not portray Smith historically. The goal of this movie was to tell Smiths life in a way that would be comfortable to the LDS Church leaders historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. The movie was designed to be a faith promoting experience not a balanced view of Smith as a man. I have taken it upon myself to study Smiths life and have read both LDS works and none LDS works. The movie like most LDS projects was beautifully filmed and well acted. However this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of Mormonism or Smiths relatively short life.<br /><br />A significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that Smith had when he was seven. While this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is in portraying Smiths teen years the film is silent regarding the Smith familys involvement in magical practices during the 1820s. Another problem is while the movie shows Joseph Smith good-naturedly entering into wrestling contests it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent.<br /><br />I could go on and on. This movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man. I would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment.',neg

Dean Koontz really cant write (I read the book at my sisters recommendation I should have known better). When I saw this (mostly out of a morbid curiosity) I actually found myself criticizing it because of the fact that it was untrue to the book even though this is a book that its impossible to make a good movie of. I figured at least if theyre going to make a film adaptation of the worst book Ive ever read the filmmakers might as well be accurate. They turned the guy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother for some reason that bothered me most of all (even though I seriously doubt keeping it a guy and his chick wouldnt have made it any better).

'Just as Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is about to get a break in his professional life his frustrated wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) finally gets up the courage to leave him leaving Ted to care for their five year old son (Justin Henry).

But then Joanna returns and intends to get her son back which leads to a cruel custody trial.<br /><br />Kramer vs. Kramer is a superbly well written and magnificently acted human drama that will only leave the most cold-hearted a viewer untouched. Hoffmans growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out. It always feels very real and thanks to the films low-key approach it makes even more of an impact and can easily work upon multiple viewings the films dramatic impact does not lessen.<br /><br />Easily recommended; 10 out of 10.',pos
'I saw this when it first came to video my little sister got it as a gift and I was probably 12 at the time... What stood out for me was the lack of mid-movie conflict that so many movies have where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just dont say the one thing that youre shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say. This is what I like the most about the movie I guess that the main characters dont do mean things to each other halfway through... they dont break up and make up they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on.<br /><br />These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track theyre not that different. Loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family and Cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone. Anyway I saw this movie posted on Hulu and had to watch it again... sure theres plot holes if you analyze the script and no Woog and Dweeb shouldnt be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality.<br /><br />Now what detracts from the film is its unexpected scariness. Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr. Screweyes. And the addition of him halfway through the movie (though its blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance) is too abrupt... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie perhaps to show that its not that scary without the the dinosaurs. I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.<br /><br />Considering the target audience who Im sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues... I think Ill give it a pass on those factors too and just enjoy the story. Its a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years I think.',pos
'Its certainly a direct-to-video but the story is not as bad as most of the other reviewers think. I quite like the fact the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time.<br /><br />The heros reactions and the reactions of the rebels are just human. The Hopper character is actually playing god. That might be the right thing to do but one may not like that anyway.<br /><br />In the end the god player is doomed to death and the hero who would have spent his own life can live. Quite a morale. :-)<br /><br />The most unrealistic thing I saw is that earth is doing so well with no moon stabilizing its rotation.',neg
'I was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week He told me it was so bad that I had to see it! So I went on an auction site and bought the film. This is probably the worst film I have EVER seen. It makes you laugh when it really shouldnt. Terrible acting and terrible storyline. Plus he looks nothing like Michael Jackson?!<br /><br />I still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this film.<br /><br />Robots cant bluff... PSYCHE!<br /><br />I have to say though the special effects are actually amazing... PSYCHE! DVDs were probably even out when this film came out but if I had my way it would be a straight to VHS release yes people it is THAT bad!',neg
'I believe this is the most powerful film HBO Pictures has made to date. This film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen. It is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the screenplay. The performances from Stephen Rea Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are flawless. A masterpiece of the genre.',pos
'Though I saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me. Stephen Reas depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving. His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable. Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x. Each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers I think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers.',pos
'Yes sure this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it. Its a good effort the killings arent that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie what a scream queen Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie the effects are nicely done okay sometimes you can guess how it is done. Some people have problems with the use of the camera I cant see whats wrong with that. Its so strange that so many people dislike this movie I really enjoyed it. Of course the script isnt original but give me one that is I mean so many slashers are made in the woods. maybe it is all predictable but its a worth see I have seen a lot worser I can tell you that',neg
'About as hilarious as 50s British comedy can get THE BELLES OF ST TRINIANS has almost a gag a minute... and at 91 minutes makes for a terrific time. Other films I equally recommend of the same period are THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and THE GREEN MAN. In fact any film with Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas George Cole Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell or any combination is a delight. in ST TRINIANS we get a double dose of Sims playing two roles with that hilarious disdain he constantly lets ripple across his face. Joyce Grenfell as Ruby Gates (oh dear! that name!) plays her jolly hockey sticks constable-incognito to hilarious perfection. Possibly the best laughs come from George Cole as Flash Harry (who comes out of a bush when whistled at) and various visits to classrooms by Ms Fritton (Sims) reacting to explosions (Oh poor Betty!) or science lab gin production (just send a few bottles of that up to my room). Every part of the film is funny from the characters their costumes the antics and the setting. There were sequels but the first three are the best: including this one BLUE MURDER AT ST TRINIANS and later in color THE GREAT ST TRINIANS TRAIN ROBBERY.',pos
'There arent too many times when I see a film and go huh what? but this was one of them. Maybe after seeing Zabriskie Point I felt much the same way Woody Allen felt after seeing 2001- he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on. Michelangelo Antonioni in one of his few tries at making films inside of the US (after Red Desert he did Blow-Up this film China and The Passenger all filmed outside his native Italy) I could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium. The results show that he doesnt lack the means to present images feelings tones colors sounds and a visual representation of this era. A directors job is to see Antonioni once stated. Whatever that means he doesnt disappoint for the admirer of his post-fifties work (I say post-fifties since Ive yet to see any of his films from before LAvventura).<br /><br />What he does lack is a point at least the kind of point that he could bring in Blow-Up and The Eclipse. You get the feeling of what is around these characters what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness however in this case the characters and the actors dont bring much conviction or purpose. Antonioni coming from the school of hard-knocks neo-realistic film-making does do what he can with his mostly non-professional cast (those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters) but the two stars Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin seem as if Antonionis under-directing them. Perhaps that was the point. The storys split into three acts thankfully not too confusing as Mark escapes his existence around the boiling dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60s LA area and Daria is sent out from LA to drive to Phoenix for some business meeting. They meet by chance as Marks plane (how does he know how to drive maybe a little background info there?) and Darias car meet up and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert. Aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene much of this act isnt terribly interesting. <br /><br />The two leads are fair enough to look at but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity? The ideas that come forth (in part from a screenplay co-written by Sam Shepard) arent too revealing except for one brief instant where drugs vs. reality is brought up. Then the film heads towards the third act as Mark decides to do the right thing under disastrous circumstances and Daria arrives at her boss place only to be in full disillusionment (not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film). Although the film took its time telling its story I didnt have as much of a problem with that as I did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer. I understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the self-confidence of the anti-establishment but maybe Antonioni isnt entirely fully aware of it himself. In some scenes he as director and editor (and the often astounding cinematography by Alfio Contini) find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground. Not to say the technical side of Zabriskie Point isnt involving to a degree (this may make some feel drowsy as Antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say Francis Ford Coppola is). <br /><br />The deserts skies city and even the faces in close-ups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame bringing us in. The soundtrack is equally compelling with a master stroke including a sweet Rolling Stones song at one point and then a crushing surreal Pink Floyd song (re-titled from Careful with that Axe Eugene one of their best pre-Dark Side) in the explosion sequence. If only the performances werent so one-sided I might find this to be on par with Blow-Up or The Eclipse. Its an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie/radical movement of the late 60s. But hey what may be boring for an American such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the US such as say Italy. And it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing.',pos
'Rugged David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and doddery Dr. Abner Perry (a delightfully dotty Peter Cushing) drill their way into the earths core in their spiffy mole machine. The duo discover an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous gigantic beasts and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men. Director Kevin Conner working from a blithely silly script by Milton Subotsky maintains a constant brisk pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing seriousness thereby giving this picture a certain clunkily earnest quality thats amusing and endearing in equal measure. The lovably hokey (not so) special effects are quite (unintentionally) funny. The cheesy array of cut-price creatures in particular are positively sidesplitting: cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber-suits pterodactyl men equally rinky-dink savage ape-man brutes and a hilariously ludicrous fire-belching frog thing who blows up real good. One gut-busting highlight occurs when McClure mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant reptile. Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slavering jaws. Moreover we also get some rousing roughnready fisticuffs and an exciting climactic slave revolt. Its a total treat to see Cushing gleefully ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely but enthusiastic arrow-slinging action hero in the last third of the flick. The ever-luscious Caroline Munro looks positively yummy as the fetching Princess Dia plus there are nice supporting turns by Cy Grant as gallant warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as treacherous coward Hoojah. Mike Vickers neatly varied score alternates between jaunty orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff. Alan Humes crisp cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the infectiously inane proceedings. A complete campy riot.',pos
'Unfortunately SpaceCamp came out about the same time as the Challenger Explosion. Which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should bring it out. Im glad they did. I first watched SpaceCamp at a drive-in movie. Which really enhanced the viewing a lot.<br /><br />While I had heard of Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I had never heard of the others in the movie. So it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting and acting real good! Of course Kate Capshaw was excellent too.<br /><br />I especially liked the scenes where those kids were being shown how to act as a team. The scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for. The actual launch of a spacecraft is of course old news to us. However this one was different.<br /><br />All in all this is one of my most treasured films. Escapist maybe but it was fantastic for a space nut like me. After probably renting it for 30 - 40 times. I finally found it available in a certain store and bought it. Now if it only comes out on DVD. I will probably have it forever. This movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me.',pos
'If this movie as meant to discourage people from doing drugs it fails. I was ready to start using them I got waiting for something to happen and nothing ever really did. This movie is neither horror or drama. Its just the paranoia of meth users. This movie may win an award for the using the F word so many times and so uselessly. It was not well stated but I felt like they were making Meth to replace Meth they owed to someone. Hector just got worse and more paranoid as the movie went on and the girl just got more hopeless. The ending really made no sense. The movie made no sense unless it was just showing how annoying is is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth-head. I relied on the other feedback when I decided to watch this movie and the rating on this movie should be a much lower average.',neg
'I dont want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said but this is one of the best series ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled and I hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again. The good news is that it is OUT ON DVD!!!! I rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character and all actors were very good. It is a shame that the network did not continue it. Shaun Cassidy this is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it must do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming very interested and will soon be a fan. She finds it very twisted and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen. I cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired.<br /><br />This show rocks!!!!',pos
'It is such a strange movie you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh-athon. Strange comes to mind again and again. Shot amateurishly acted even worse and the directions maybe none. The special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit. See it if you got time to kill. But dont dont even try to take it seriously. Supposed to be a tribute to Porno holocaust . Since I havent seen it from the tribute I can assume it to be as bad. Should have given it 1/10 but it did give me a good laugh or two so it gets a 3. Excessive gore the only thing somebody worked on. Stay away if you are squeamish more gore than laughs. Wonder if the makers had a laugh making it?',neg
'A quick paced and entertaining noir set in Vienna just after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who cant find legal work because he does not have any papers. No papers means no work permit which means no way to get a passport. He survives by driving a friends cab at night. If he gets caught it means three months in jail. One night he picks up a fare at a big hotel and drives the man to an airline office. Buka takes the mans luggage in and returns to the car. There he finds his customer has acquired an unneeded hole in the back of his head. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit they will put the grab on him real quick. No he needs time to think this out. He drives to a secluded spot empties the mans pockets and hides the body. He now has an American passport and plenty of cash! He drops by an underworld contact to have the passport photo changed. Now he just needs to go to the mans hotel and collect the mans plane ticket. His ticket to freedom! Needless to say that would be too simple. Waiting at the hotel is the dead mans mistress Joan Camden. Camden is on the run from her rather nasty husband Francis Lederer Lederer is of course the swine who had bumped off the man in Bukas cab. Camden calls the police since she believes Buka has robbed her lover. Buka shows his new passport and manages to talk his way out of the mess. Camden breaks down when hubby Lederer shows up at the police station. Lederer convinces the police Camden has suffered a mental breakdown and she is released to him. She escapes again finds Buka and the two decide to flee the country together. Lederer again puts in an appearance and Buka must decide if helping Camden is worth his freedom. This film is much better than Im making it sound. Buka is best known as the low-life cop killer in 1950s Between Midnight and Dawn. The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey.',pos
'Well Im probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site but The Good Earth is one of the worst structured films Ive seen in a long time. We have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one. The first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine. They have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind. Conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended. Yeah OK. With this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again. <br /><br />Well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it. You would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film. However the film then continues on for a whole other hour. And in this remaining time its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers. Oh yea and the age old money is the root of all evil blah blah blah. Just because you know your making an epic film doesnt mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to. Also the main idea I would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together. Then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasnt even cared about through most of the film. <br /><br />Oh wait and the film isnt the only thing thats poorly written the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense. She complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda. Then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery. Even if they are starving at the time of this idea it still doesnt make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again. <br /><br />There are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to. The only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography. The land is shot beautifully oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive. Too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say. <br /><br />One last thing. I know that at this point in time Hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything. For most of the film Paul Muni does portray an Asian man to the best of his ability but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old Italian Paul they even cut his hair so he looks like Tony from Scarface(also a better film than this). Of all the main characters in the film I think maybe three are actually Asian the rest are just Americans being silly. Oh and please Ms. Rainer that was a really nice one note performance not if i could i rip the Oscar out of your hands oh i would. <br /><br />The Good Earth is one epic waste of time. If you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get The Grapes of Wrath a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets. Mainly because it wasnt written by a monkey.',neg
'Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have just welcomed a baby girl Azaria. As Seventh Day Adventists they live their beliefs every day and soon have Azaria dedicated to God at their church with their two older boys looking on. Michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to Ayers Rock one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of Australia. Not being wealthy the family camps near the site. After a wonderful first day Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly she hears Azaria crying. As Lindy rushes to the tent a dingo dog is just exiting shaking his head. The baby is gone and soon so is the dingo. Although the entire camp looks for the baby she is not found. Concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child the Chamberlains struggle to accept Gods decision and go on with their lives. But unfortunately the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that Lindy murdered the baby. She is subsequently arrested and put on trial. How could this happen? This is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination. The entire country turns against the Chamberlains in part because they are seen as odd. Streep gives her best performance ever as the complex Lindy whose own strong-willed demeanor works against her every step of the way. Neill likewise does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused Michael. The cast is one of the largest ever with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into Lindys case. The costumes scenery script direction and production are all top of the line. If you have never seen or heard of this film remedy that straight away. It is not a far cry from reality to say that this Cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media.',pos
'James Dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. When one reads Deliverance one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the Deep South. When one watches John Boormans film version of the book one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narration. The characters are fully realized and the portrayals are fantastic. I first saw this movie in 1992 after my freshman year of college. I was in a phase where I was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973. Among them were Patton Papillon and All the Presidents Men; fine films all of them. This one was easily the class of the group. That says a lot.',pos
'I tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch. I was immediately sucked in by the characters.<br /><br />Robin Tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film. Her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100\% believable. Really this sort of thing is not easy to do. She pulls it off fantastically.<br /><br />We know early on this film is going to end tragically but you cannot take your eyes off of it. The characters do stupid things but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters.<br /><br />This is just a great example of film making IMHO. Great writing great acting great directing. A film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment.',pos
'Only children below the age of 12 should be allowed to see this film. The rest of us should take a book MP3 player or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event.

'A fine performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno and a masterful one by Jean-Hugues Anglade adorn this stange tale of lust desire and alienation in France. The work of the two lead performers is striking--subtle intense and passionate. Alas the script is deliberately turgid and sordid and the overall effect leaves one with a downcast spirit. Still those who can appreciate fine quality acting will be able to savor the courageous work of the leads in this often difficult film journey of Gallic low life.<br /><br />',pos
'Yeah I know his character was supposed to be a drunk and he may have been just acting goofy. But something tells this critic that Mr. Pleasence really was drinking a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes in the film. Basically everything he says is slurred and often unintelligible. Or maybe it was just the poor productions values... hard to say.<br /><br />Anyway The Race for the Yankee Zephyr is a film that just doesnt work. Thats a shame too since the film has a terrific opening and a generally interesting plot. Ultimitely the production values are just too low and the action just too sparse for this New Zealand adventure to deliver the goods. The story deals with a US war plane which is filled with gold money and medals which crashes into a lake in New Zealand during WWII. The plane remains lost for about forty years or so until it somehow washes ashore and a drunk (Pleasence) literally stumbles onto it. At first he gathers up all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in town actually getting $75 apiece for them! Little does he know that once he sells them the local jeweler gets on the phone and starts trying to track down info about the plane. Before you can blink all of the attention brings a wealthy scumbag (Peppard) and his henchmen into town and they quickly try to force the old guy to give up the location of the plane since they know there is much more on it than just medals. The old drunks business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then race out to try and claim the fortune before the bad guys can get to it. The resulting action just isnt as fun as youd hope it would be.<br /><br />The acting is rather awful save for Pleasence. George Peppard tries to do some kind of (I guess) Austrailian accent but it is hardly convincing. Lesley Ann Warren isnt too bad but Ken Wahl is really bad. Hes basically doing his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And thats saying something. Hopefully he made enough money on this film to fix his front teeth which looked a bit crooked. I dont recall if hed had them straightened by the time he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the cast are pretty untalented. Probably mostly locals who never did much else. I guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the film and the lack of danger. The villains are just too nice and goofy to be taken seriously. And honestly there are NO helicopters in the film that look like the ones on the DVD cover. And none of the boats in the film have teeth painted on them either.<br /><br />The film does have its strengths though. The beginning which starts off as a newsreel and then becomes part of the story was a nice touch. Brian Mays score sounds a little too much like the one in Mad Max 2 but he included a nice little march they play for Pleasence in some scenes. Sounds just like the one in the Great Escape! There are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming. The scenery despite the grainy look of the picture is still quite beautiful. The thing youll remember most is the drunken antics of Donald Pleasence though. He was almost enough to save this film. Almost. 4 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.',neg
'This is actually a trilogy of 3 of Somerset Maughams short tales. The first one is The Verger which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. After 17 years Albert Foreman is laid off from his church job because he cant read nor write. So what does he do? Opens a tobacco shop of course!<br /><br />The second is Mr. Know-All which was actually a story I had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten until I heard the familiar introduction. Another 15 minute one and also very good. It worked better on film than in a book for me but then perhaps thats because I was only 14 the last time afterall.<br /><br />The 3rd one is nearly a let-down. Almost an hour in length it simply drags. Its not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last 2. I watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really I hadnt missed a thing!<br /><br />Overall I give them 8 9 and 6 out of 10 respectively.',pos

'All you need is great house a babysitter and a phone. Simon West directs this thrilling and chilling remake of the 1979 original. This version is more of a thriller than a horror flick. Emotionally tense with an escalating fear factor. Jill Johnson(Camilla Belle)needs to work off an excessive cell phone bill; she takes on the task of babysitting the two children of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis(Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a beautiful 1970ish wood and glass masterpiece. Secluded and peaceful. The kids are already in bed the wind builds and is joined by down-pouring rain. The phone begins ringing ringing ringing. The babysitter is soon in a frantic mode of survival in fear of the creepy stranger on the other end of the phone.<br /><br />Belle is great as the innocent smart and strong teen babysitter. The voice of the stranger on the phone is that of Lance Henriksen while the physical stranger is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also featured are: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty.

'I saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening and I must say I was extremely disappointed. And I have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think about Danes she was either horribly miscast or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 Razzie for Worst Actress. I think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her. Instead she is completely unlikeable. The other great actresses do an OK job but certainly dont light up the screen. Out of all the great actresses in this movie Id say the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the picture and only appears near the very end.<br /><br />Horrible screenplay as well. It comes off more as them reading lines than truly being in character.',neg
'Redundant everlasting shots useless shots useless scenes are what you will find in this film. In other words it seemed technically poor to me. The musical bits are amateurishly directed (no synchronization in the would-be dancing badly post-synchronized bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time etc). <br /><br />The film is long and boring. Eventually it makes few point and even less sense. <br /><br />There are some good ideas though. Some of the comic elements are actually efficient especially the opening scene. However the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end. <br /><br />The trailer I saw was very dynamic that is not true for the film. That is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off.',neg
'A brilliant Russian émigré devises the Stanislavsky system for winning at contract bridge - which makes him and his beautiful wife the GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America.<br /><br />What could have been just another silly soap opera is elevated by fine production values & excellent acting to the status of a very enjoyable little comedy. A few unexpected touches are thrown in to keep the viewers attention engaged - the way in which the principle cast is introduced as faces on a deck of cards; the introduction of a zany acrobat into the plot for no other reason than to enjoy a bit of lunacy; and the way in which a wide variety of different kinds of Americans are shown to be transfixed by listening to the broadcast of the concluding game.<br /><br />Paul Lukas & Loretta Young do very well as the Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas suave & sophisticated and Miss Young passionately loving and beautiful (even if the script keeps her puffing on a cigarette a bit too much). They are fun to watch even when their behavior is not always the most believable or compelling.<br /><br />Frank McHugh gives another good performance as a relentlessly cheerful ghost writer who adores Miss Young. The delightful Glenda Farrell eschews her customary wisecracking persona in a small role as McHughs ditsy gal pal. Roscoe Karns handles the fast-talking dialogue as a brash radio announcer. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is wonderful as a snobbish bridge expert.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize Dewey Robinson as a belligerent nightclub patron; Emma Dunn as a sob sister reporter; Paul Porcasi as the owner of the Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer at the final bridge game - all uncredited.<br /><br />The film takes advantage of the fad for contract bridge which had swept across the country since its development in the 1920s. It expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and makes no attempt to explain anything to the uninformed.',pos
'Why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo moon-landing with the Titanic sinking and youve got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low-life trash. Is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and who failed grade school composition do? Ill show those old meanies Ill put out my own movie and prove that you dont have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money! Yeah we already know that. The one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking. The next time I see a slut in a bar who looks like Diane Lane Im running the other way. Its child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids. Its audience abuse to simply stick Woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969.',neg
'I watched this film because I noticed that it had Kari Wuhrer in the cast. I have long had a theory about her that she is a talented actress but never seems to get to prove that because she is always in this sort of low-budget B movie. She is still beautiful and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material I always see her in. This is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing but that doesnt make it good. George Wendt played against type and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role. Another note about Ms. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since I saw her last. Perhaps reduction surgery or (more likely) removal of implants. This NOT a bad thing. She still looks great. I would like to see her in a better movie.',neg
'This is by far the best movie Ive seen in a long while. It is a wholly original and beautiful plot. It is not boring nor is it too dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic but it does not take away from the story line. The fact that is not in English is most likely the final touch. The end leaves you fulfilled in a way Ive never experienced in a movie before. <br /><br />I wish I had found this movie earlier.<br /><br />More lines.<br /><br />more lines.<br /><br />more lines a lot more lines cmon im done',pos
'This movie is the proverbial 80s flick that shows the viewer that as long as he or she tries at something they can be better than the pros. The main character Doug showed off his skills in flying a Cessna aircraft which somehow equated to being fully capable of flying a jet aircraft and being able to kill people. We all would like to have a few million dollars to play with... maybe make a good investment donate buy a few things but the directors of this movie decided to make Iron Eagle... not once... not twice... not even three times; yes four times. The thing to look most forward to are the multitude hollywood endings in this movie. Just when you think the movie is going to end after a cheesy end sequence theres another cheesy end sequence. Then another. Definitely a movie one must watch to believe... and maybe own just to remind oneself of how awesome the 80s must have been.',neg
'What an awful adaptation. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800s?????? The only character that didnt bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one and I love Jane Austen movies usually. I didnt even rent it I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I dont quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the bad guys and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good isnt. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies Ive seen.',neg
'This movie is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost-story and suspense-thriller conventions none of them fully realized and all of them rather irritating. The script was perfunctory. The acting ditto. The scary FX were mostly laughable except for one exquisite seat-jumper moment that scared me even though I saw it coming a mile off. Now explain to me someone why you would need ghosts AND black magic AND arcane ritual objects AND Count Crapula CG boogeymen AND psychic investigators AND family curses AND Irish superstitions AND bowls of milk left out for the supernatural beings AND possessed dollies all in the same movie? With all that you would expect more than one good moment of horror but this movie is lame lame lame.',neg

'Curiously it is Rene Russos eyes and mouth--not Buddy the Gorillas-- that emerge as the focal point of Buddy a Jim Henson Pictures production through Francis Ford Coppolas Zoetrope. Somehow countless close-ups of Russos face slipped passed in the post-production stages and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are upstaged. Unintentionally funny true story adapted from Gertrude Trudy Davies Lints memoirs about a wealthy doctors wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild-life. The movie goes beyond good intentions...it positively drips with earnest sincerity. The movie never sparkles with the kind of family film magic that it needed and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here feels real). About ten minutes in two chimpanzees are goofing around in Russos kitchen and start throwing a butchers knife back and forth (it misses Alan Cummings head by inches); yet no eyebrows are raised because its all in a days fun. Still when full-grown gorilla Buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm the cops are called--and everyone stares at Buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture. The furniture should be the least of anyones worries in this flabbergasting do-gooder failure. But at least we know Russo was in good hands: whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up shot she gives unstartled Rene another extreme close-up. I wonder what the lipstick budget was on this picture? ** from ****',neg
'This is a good movie a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do. If you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book you will be very very disappointed. I was somewhat disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in elementary school.<br /><br />This is about a new kid in town named Billy. He makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets. Billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins.<br /><br />The acting is OK probably the worst part of the movie. The kid actors over exaggerate on many things. They think its apocalypse if Billy does not eat the worms. Hallie Eisenberg did a magnificent job though.<br /><br />The plot line is good as a movie but it sucks as a book adaptation. I was able to watch this movie without looking at the time....sometimes.<br /><br />Overall this was a good family movie with some weak points. I rate this movie 7/10.',pos
'It plays like your usual teenage-audience T&A movie but the sentiment is incredibly bleak. If it was made today itd be considered an art house movie. It goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying.<br /><br />The whole teen flick formula is adhered to but nothing turns out the way youd expect. Imagine a directors cut of Its a Wonderful Life where at the end James Stewart wasnt allowed to return to the real world. An incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of the genre. It makes you feel dirty afterwards: there is no redemption for the characters. Im amazed it ever got made. The eighties version of Detective Story.',pos
'Deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom as it primarily takes place on one set. The premise is that an accomplished playwright whose star is falling receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play to the (loud) protests of his wife. Or so you think for the first half of the movie. Past the halfway mark Deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head then right around and then in a mad spin all the time keeping its title appropriate. Its an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit. <br /><br />Michael Caine as the senior playwright plays himself in this movie - a slightly loony and very dramatic Brit. No surprises here - he does his usual good work. He gets the best line of Deathtrap which he executes perfectly: What is your definition of success being gang-banged in a state penitentiary? <br /><br />Christopher Reeve on the other hand juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He also gets to show off his very toned body which he mustve retained coming off the Superman movies. <br /><br />Caine and Reeve have collaborated in another movie thats one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. It similarly revolves around a play as well although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They are joined by comic veterans Carol Burnett John Ritter Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed-hopping cast and crew of a play. On the surface the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch. Wish this underrated movie was available on DVD.',pos
'This game was terrible. I think they worked too hard on the visuals and didnt do much with the gameplay which is the most important part. I mean the visuals look incredible but is the game really fun? NO! I mean its like hey lets jump off buildings and all Im doing is holding up and A/X. The game play just isnt there and I dont agree with what Ubisoft did because they had this hot girl (the producer of the game Jade Raymond) and they were like OK weve got this hot girl lets pimp her and if you go to gaming websites youre not gonna see gameplay stuff of Assassins Creed youll see her face with a microphone and itll be like We interviewed Jade Raymond about her favorite cookies! Its like man shut the F*@K UP WHO CARES?! Apparently...a lot of people do because they bought the game and like it...I mean compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that really doesnt abuse the Wii Remote but STILL is very innovative and delivers in the most important part GAMEPLAY! They were able to do a bit of everything with Mario Galaxy the graphics were still stunning the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing and THATS a game that deserves game of the year. NOT Assassins Creed man it doesnt even deserve to even be a NOMINEE for Game of the Year. The hype around this game where it was like oh its the next generation of gaming....really? I think not! So let me get this straight here because I think the people liking this game are only liking it because theyre Jade fans so Ill tell you guys JADE WILL NOT MAKE OUT WITH YOU OR ANYTHING IF YOU LOVE OR DEFEND THIS GAME! If you want a REAL game on the PS3 get Uncharted: Drakes Fortune if you want a REAL game for the Xbox 360 get Call of Duty 4 (and a ton of other games too) and if you want a REAL game just in all the systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment will be hated by many but seriously pressing two buttons for doing all this cool stuff is that REALLY a fun game? The only reason why other games make it more complicated is because after itll end up being more innovative and fun. And this game just isnt it.<br /><br />1.3/10 A LIVING HELL!',neg
'Its astonishing that some people saw this as art. We saw it as a poorly filmed (shaky hand-held camera and all) (generally) badly acted unscripted mess that seemed more like a high school film project with the kids experimenting in black & white film making. Injecting mounds of poetry in place of a story does not an art film make. When we watched this in the theatre people were starting to have fits of the giggles (us included) at the endless stupidity of this self-indulgent meandering mess. And believe me it does seem endless. Had we finished our candy and popcorn we too would have walked out of the theatre with the other two dozen people who packed up and left looking for something more interesting to do!',neg

'Space Camp which had the unfortunate luck to be planned around the time of the Challenger accident deserves such luck. The stars make a mockery of acting Lea Thomson actually being turned sideways when asked for more than her usual wide-eyed innocent smile presumably to mask her risible attempts. The movie is at times hilarious when it begins to ask far too much of you. A small boy keeps a multi-million dollar robot in his closet which breaks when given too many commands by the hordes of cliched dorm-mates. This hackneyed and unlovable machine Jinx is a major player in the ridiculous premise of the movie which seems part Short Circuit part 2001 by the Airplane team. I shant bore you with this suffice it to say you can only laugh when faced with it. Having said all of this it is enjoyable to watch in a SeaQuest Saved by the Bell kind of way. The romance and technology beware are as unbelievable as each other. Also if youre an eighties freak its unmissable for the amusing performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie from Temple of Doom) and obviously Lea Thompson. Also Joaquin Phoenix puts in a dodgy turn as a sort of wannabe Goonie who befriends Jinx. Do not go near this movie if you are not a fan of trash.',neg
'CAMILLE 2000 <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Panavision)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Whilst visiting Rome an amorous nobleman (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert) but their unlikely romance is opposed by Castelnuovos wealthy father (Massimo Serato) and Fate deals a tragic blow...<br /><br />A sexed-up love story for the swinging Sixties adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas La Dame aux Camelias) by screenwriter Michael DeForrest and directed with freewheeling flair by Radley Metzger who along with the likes of Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno is credited with redefining the parameters of Adult cinema throughout the 1960s and 70s. Using the scope format for the last time in his career Metzgers exploration of la dolce vita is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces for example) though the films sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards. Production values are handsome throughout and the performances are engaging and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable) despite weak post-sync dubbing. Though set in an unspecified future Enrico Sabbatinis wacked-out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period and Piero Piccionis wah-wah music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees. Ultimately CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste but fans of this directors elegant softcore erotica wont be disappointed. Next up for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970) which many consider his best film.',neg

'This review contains a partial spoiler.<br /><br />Shallow from the outset D.O.A. at least starts as if it might be a slick entertaining piece of nonsense like Finchers The Game. Its central character(Dennis Quaid) suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that appear to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller. But the plot rattles along at too great a pace leading to a dramatic twist not half way through when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live. And this simply is too big a twist to add casually to a story. Once this has happened the films only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal indeed its only subject matter: but D.O.A. continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller. The problem is two-fold: firstly Quaids actions dont convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do; and secondly even if they did convince its hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been prematurely resolved. The rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort but made more tedious than usual by the characters slightly-treated predicament which logically dwarfs the events the film is interested in. Dennis Quaid in the lead role doesnt convince either as a burnt out professor or as a man who is destined to die: Meg Ryan is as often ditzy and annoying. Another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack. Watch The Game instead which from similar roots remains tight and character-driven whereas D.O.A. drifts into developments that only undermine its own premise. As the premise is itself quite intriguing its a shame to see it drowned in a surplus of over-cooked plot.',neg
'This movie is pretty good as it is but the unreleased Producers Cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original. Jamies story is handled differently the death scenes are done 10 times better theres more footage of ritual type stuff giving more story about Micheal Jamie and her baby.

'Heavens Gate is not a masterpiece which apparently was what it needed to be upon first release to justify its great cost and more importantly the continued uneasy reliance of Hollywood on the Auteur model of film-making. Yet Heavens Gate seen today at last on DVD in a cut of 229 minutes is a superb film. It is a touch lethargic in pace. But at least it is paced. Quite apart from the incompetence of construction that marks many films today there have been many films which deliberate in form have been severely damaged by being hacked down with no care for rhythm so the films become shapeless and confusing. Beyond this the criticisms leveled at the film have become in retrospect quite lame. If the good guys and bad guys are too obviously pronounced for a serious film and yes Sam Waterstons mustachioed fur-clad villain is comic-opera (and not in the multi-leveled manner of Bill The Butcher from Gangs of New York) and yes the townsfolk do seem a touch Fiddler On The Roof on occasions then a few dozen serious films made since then including Titanic and the graceless Cold Mountain (which bears certain similarities and is a notable failure in convincing qualities compared to this film) can be castigated for exactly the same reason. <br /><br />Also despite accusations the film has a plot quite a well-essayed plot at that. It simply does not bow to standard-form epic quality by providing Titan heroes rafts of sub-plots and confusion. It experiments with telling in a manner more like much smaller modest films by carefully-caught moments of character interaction and well-textured pageant-like explosions of communal action as with the opening at Harvard and most specially the wonderful scene where the Johnson County folk following the lead of a brilliantly physical fiddler make celebration on roller-skates.<br /><br />The Deer Hunter was a critical and commercial success but abandoned the first halfs inspired mosaic-like accumulation of detail and I think in a manner similar to criticism of Robert Penn Warrens novel All The Kings Men and its dictionary of Jacobean stunts if Cimino had not had such a strong grasp of the conventions of Hollywood epics he might have made a special rare work of art based in honest visualisation of people within their milieu. In contrast Heavens Gate succeeds in screwing its narrative momentum and tension upwards in a slowly expanding arc until the finale explodes whilst not abandoning the mosaic approach.<br /><br />The central romantic triangle for instance resists standard inflections; a decent intelligent but psychically defeated man James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) competes with a hot-shot but identity-challenged young gunman Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) for the hand of a young Madame Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert); there is no self-conscious bed-hopping no slaps in the face recriminations or typical sad-sack moments but more a sad and distanced decision by Ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make the commitment. Ella emerges as the films true hero (Hupperts performance though initially awkward is really quite excellent balancing a dewy emotionalism with a hard-hammered spirit) attempting first to rescue Nate and then mustering the resistance party of immigrants into an enterprising defence. Subsequently Averill is stung into action as friends die. Indeed in the process of overcoming so many traps of cliché and style Heavens Gate successfully and willfully throws off the defeated outsider-heroes grace note of so many 70s Westerns and portrays an eventual vigorous cheer-the-heroes rallying to a compromised but still relished victory. <br /><br />The social conflict of so many 70s Westerns at last hardens into a fully-fledged war; where capital attempts a crushing final victory over the miscreants who stand in their way suddenly they find a massed and more-powerful peoples army led by the man who played the thoroughly-destroyed Billy the Kid a decade before. This is what led the film to be described as the first Marxist Western but really it simply deflowers a theme of the genre extant well before the 60s. Such various and classic old-school works as William Wylers The Westerner and even Shane tell awfully similar stories. It is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunslinger has been replaced by the romantic myth of the peoples revolt. In a spectacular exiting but realistic and thus chaotic finale the marauding Cattlemens encampment is attacked ringed by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses writhing bodies and gunfire. Averill puts his classical education to work finally by stealing a Roman trick and bringing the Cattlemen to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by the Cavalry (another distinctly seditious touch but surely not so offensive after Little Big Mans unrelenting depiction of Native American massacres). Really its hard to think of a more heroically American vision of grassroots resistance. The films only real dead spot stands as an unnecessary coda indicating Averills eventual relapse a rather potted piece of tragedy. <br /><br />Despite then certain failings and a slow mid-section Heavens Gate is a supreme piece of work a genuine attempt to create a contemporary Western and a new kind of epic. If one has to still join the chorus that reckons Cimino was absurd in his behaviour on set and expenditure it is regretfully. When today flops like The Adventures of Pluto Nash and K-19 - The Widowmaker see nearly a hundred million dollars sink down the drain and yet a tag of infamy still hangs on this film one ponders what exactly its grim death signified. The attempt at original style the bawdy sexuality the very hard-won sense of detail the breathtaking rigor of the film-making and what is being filmed all throw into contrast what is sorely lacking in so much contemporary Hollywood product.',pos
'As predictable as a Hallmark card but not without merit The Rookie makes for a solid outing. Dennis Quaid the most reasonable jock actor working today is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player Jimmy Morris.

'Given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting Gold Silver and Bronze at a Darwin Awards Olympic ceremony. A mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing so.<br /><br />If you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camera-work (my 92 year-old grandmother wields a camcorder with better results) extremely poor sound and no discernible plot/narrative then this is your ideal film. Also note that you should enjoy the following: women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason. In fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film. For example: we have to find Stephanie yeah I cant believe I was speaking to her like last night she called you last night? yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one WHAT? How come she didnt tell me? As in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but I have a problem with the fact that she didnt tell me she was going on a date.<br /><br />Okay so the budget is low. That doesnt mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget. The score is interesting since all - with the exception of one - tracks have been written and performed by the writers/directors of the film itself. In fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by The Duskfall a death metal band from Sweden.<br /><br />The most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel.',neg
'Pretty funny stuff. Charlie was still working towards his peak when he made this rather daring short about soldiers in the trenches of World War One. Daring because after all the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business.<br /><br />The gags are amusing without being either hilarious or tear jerking. One successful scene follows another as Chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker that is knee deep in water. (Thats where we got the term trench foot from.) Probably the most ludicrous episode has Chaplin disguised as a tree and foiling any number of German soldiers as they try to execute an Allied soldier caught behind the lines. Edna Purviance Chaplins main squeeze at the time is a woman who cooperates with the Americans and is saved from execution too.<br /><br />Chaplin would go on to do funnier and more ambitious things but this is better than most of his shorts during this early period.',pos
'A sentimental heart-tugging family film set in England of the 1920s. A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter him in the Grand National; fortunately ex-jockey Mickey Rooney is around to give Liz some help. Director Clarence Brown displays some remarkable control with material that couldve been excessively maudlin in someone elses hands. He and screenwriters Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally. True there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced but overall its quite affecting and gorgeously filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is quite thrilling and like so many great classics theres a marvelous three-hankie fade-out at the end. Liz proves that she was a real trooper right from the start and Rooney--who I usually find rather annoying--is surprisingly subdued and really very good. Donald Crisp is terrif as Lizs gruff father and Angela Lansbury is a delight as her older boy-crazy sister. Most of the acting kudos however belong to Anne Revere who won a richly deserved Supporting Actress Oscar playing Lizs wise and caring mother.',pos

Mischief nightly fridge-raids and all the other fun stuff that we all remember from our summer camps.

'This incredibly formulaic flick from the Walker Texas Ranger squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. In addition one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. However its a fun little movie that gets the job done: it entertains. Thats all it was meant to do and it does so. The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isnt half bad. The acting is also decent which isnt much of a surprise because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal. If youre a fan of the genre (and of Walker Texas Ranger) you will definitely love this. If not then dont waste your time. 8/10',pos
'Disappointing musical version of Margaret Landons Anna and the King of Siam itself filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison has Deborah Kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to accept job as tutor to the Kings many children--and perhaps teach the Royal One a thing or two in the process! Stagy picture begins well but quickly loses energy and focus. Yul Brynner reprising his stage triumph as the King is a commanding presence but is used--per the concocted story--as a buffoon. Kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better despite having to lip-synch to Marni Nixons vocals. Perhaps having already played this part to death Brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast. Second-half with Anna and the moppets staging a musical version of Uncle Toms Cabin is quite ridiculous and the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering. Brynner won a Best Actor Oscar but it is feisty Kerr who keeps this bauble above water. Overlong heavy and old-fashioned in the worst sense of the term. ** from ****',neg
'Simply the best Estonian film that I have ever seen although it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 90s Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries such as Estonia became independent. Now the conditions may be better in most of those countries. But in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as inheritance. (And many of them still do...at least on some level...) <br /><br />Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well-written script. The actors are also very good especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the best known Estonian actor plays Snaut in Tarkovskis Solaris) playing and old gangster whos slowly becoming tired of his way of life. But the most astonishing performance comes from Monika Mäger a child-actor playing Terje a boyish girl in her early teens whose presence in the plot is quite essential. (and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb-credit list!!!)w<br /><br />There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does that. Unfortenately Järvi-Laturis other films are far from this kind of achievements. His first one Kotia päin was too artificial and his latest History is Made at Night was just a weird mess.',pos
'Have not seen this 1958 film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed Kim Novak playing the role as Gil Holroyd who is an actual witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a witch and Gillian also has a brother warlock named Nick played by Jack Lemmon. When Gillian sets her eyes on Shep Henderson(James Stewart) who is engaged to a girl he is going to marry; Gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very lust full and falls in love with Gillian. The story tells that a real witch cannot fall in love blush or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided they have to do something about this situation. Great film to view over and over again and a great classic film from 1958.',pos
'There are many adaptations of Charlotte Brontës classic novel Jane Eyre and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best. The short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a 100 min. length consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel. The TV series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroines life.<br /><br />There are three TV mini series released in 73 83 and 2006. The 2006 version is not only the worst of these three but the worst of all Jane Eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film. The novels beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel. What it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the Rochester and Jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set. It is a silly soap opera in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake. This Jane Eyre (as it dares to call itself) is indeed a slap in the face of Charlotte Brontë.<br /><br />The 1973 version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between Mr. Rochester and Jane are rendered in nearly their full length. But what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen. At times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by Janes voice-overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess. And despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured. Another problem is the casting of the main characters. Sorcha Cusacks portrayal of Jane as a bold self-confident worldly-wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model and Michael Jayston although a good actor does simply not possess the commanding physical presence nor the charisma necessary to play Rochester. Although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience.<br /><br />All the faults of the 73 version stand corrected in the TV mini series of 83 with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Although from a purists point of view Timothy Dalton is too handsome tall and lean to be Rochester he possesses the essential qualities for the role: He has an imposing physical presence great magnetism and an air of self-assurance and authority. And despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of Thornfield convincingly. But the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of Rochesters character. Of all the actors who have played Rochester he is the only one to capture them all: Rochesters harshness nearly insolence his moodiness and abruptness as well as his humorous side his tenderness his solicitude and deep frantic love. Daltons handling of Charlotte Brontës language is equally superb. Even Rochesters most far-fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when Dalton delivers them. He is the definitive Rochester unsurpassed and unsurpassable and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine Rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of Rochester. She portrays exactly the Jane of the novel an outwardly shy reserved and guarded young woman but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will. She catches beautifully the duality in Janes character: her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong. She and Dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight.<br /><br />As regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the 73 version but with one important difference: The dialogues are shortened in this version but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged. Thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of Charlotte Brontës language. And in contrast to the earlier BBC version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured.<br /><br />The plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the 73 series. It is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of Janes life. It is the only Jane Eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel and the only one which does full justice to the novels pivotal and most heartrending scene when Jane and Rochester meet after the aborted wedding. Timothy Dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill. He renders with almost painful intensity Rochesters anguish as he realizes Janes resolution to leave him his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him. It is a heartbreaking almost devastating scene which will stay with the viewer for a long time.<br /><br />With even the smaller roles perfectly cast an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true Jane Eyre.',pos
'I have to admit when I went to see this movie I didnt really have high expectations. But even with my low expectations I was totally and utterly disappointed...<br /><br />Basically Luke Wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends. Theres slight mention of a girl stalking him but thats pretty much it for that character. Which i dont quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie.<br /><br />So while on a subway Rainn Wilson (who i actually liked before this movie) convinces him to talk to a hot girl Uma Thurman. This is strange to say the least as everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong under the category of hot.<br /><br />Rainn Wilsons performance is also far from hot. Normally Im all for his acting but even he couldnt salvage this movie. His character was jumpy unrealistic and rather annoying. You could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy or just desperate. It was almost painful.<br /><br />But anyway someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway and Luke Wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero or G-Girl as they like to call her in the movie. It still baffles me as to what the G stands for but well leave that for the message boards to debate.<br /><br />The sex scenes I assume are supposed to be funny but I find myself asking who has sex like that? They nearly throw the bed through the wall because of Uma Thurmans passion lets say. It makes my head hurt but not in the Im thinking really hard to understand this way.<br /><br />When Uma insults Anna Faris calling her a whore I had no debate with that. Apart from the fact that she cant choose movies properly she cant act and relies souly on the fact that shes blonde and typical.<br /><br />Overall I wouldve walked out of the theater if i hadnt paid $8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesnt mean youre acting.<br /><br />Also the script and storyline couldve used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid. I actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors and their dying careers. Overall if you value your money and your self respect do NOT waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie.',neg
'but there are not too many of them. Probably the worst major release film I have seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. There is no point in commenting on the plot the cast or the acting. The problem is beyond all that. It lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind (not the funny kind) of everything that takes place on the screen. I dont know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably because of Steven Martini. He really did try. Bottom line - 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells. Avoid at any cost.',neg
'Back in the 70s a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years. Before viewing his first film Dont Look In The Basement I wasnt too sure what to expect but I sure as hell didnt expect it to turn out to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw Massacre. I dont know this might actually be my all-time favorite horror movie.<br /><br />We begin in an isolated insane asylum. At first it seems like a rather laid-back place to get mentally healthy considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot as if it were their house (I guess it is). none of them seem all that dangerous only delusional. The residents include a love-nympho a 700 year old woman a man-child a spaz a guy who thinks hes in a war a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks hes a judge. One day out of nowhere Judge kills the doctor with an axe shortly thereafter the wanna-be baby mama kills the nurse. Ten minutes into the movie and things are looking really ugly. Perhaps the new nurse will know what to do then again perhaps not. Giving away more would do more harm than good. Its best to plunge head first into this one knowing as little as possible. If you can appreciate honest-to-God untampered with horror then you will not be disappointed. <br /><br />If you liked Scream if you liked Wrong Turn if you go for that unoriginal over-produced over-scored digital Hollywood garbage then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one. Dont Look In The Basement being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking. The atmosphere and the graininess fit into the location and the score like a glove. Unfortunately good ol S.F. used up most of his good ideas on his first movie although the next entry in his Texas-sized quadrilogy is somewhat of a masterpiece that is if youre into extra sleazy mean-spirited Hixploitation like someone I know. If you fall in love with Brownriggs first two and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer check out Dont Open The Door and The House Where Hell Froze Over. Dont Look in The Basement has everything that successful horror needs no stars no budget no digital effects just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum with a dozen cast members and a somber subtle score and of course the twist. This is real horror for the real horror fan. 10/10',pos
'I am not from America and I know what Wife Swap is. When a show came out of that name I was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sexual moments from the program. But what I got was a real sucking stupidity. I was misjudged by its title name it has no adult contents no nudity not even vulgar dialogues (broad casted threw Hallmark channel and I think they edited/mute out such contents to make it neat).<br /><br />A show which gives a picture of current American/western family state overweight chubby peoples polluted teenagers and their sucking family goings. In each episode two wives/two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in each others home and re-changes each others family routine with their new own rule. Sometimes its turns out to be good or more evenly bad. On the ending section each mothers are brought back with their husband and try to conclude what they did to each families past days. Its the sucking portion of the program were each contenders fights for their rights. I was sucked to see all of these instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff. I mean who make this program more than that who gave the name Wife Swap; its better to be called as Mother Swap. All in all it corrupts all the great things the real Wife Swap stands for! <br /><br />Wife Swap = Average Sucking Reality Show.',neg
'This is the kind of film that I am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning. This is the kind of movie that I cannot understand how people put money in it how the rental store can put the DVD on its shelves. This is the kind of movie I blame myself for having rented it. <br /><br />There are good class-B movies and I do not reject the genre. When they are good they catch the interest with the action they have characters written well enough and acted well enough so that you can care about them. The effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases and you may like them for the originality. Almost nothing is true in Coronado. The subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics - just a cliche. The effects are cheap - and I do not care that the film is low budget - you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent. There are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films. You do not care for the characters you do not laugh and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not. The only quality I could find is the scenery there are some good locations worth a much better film. <br /><br />2/10 on my personal scale. The worst film of the year so far.',neg
'Think of this film as fan service a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer. We start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film. Flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins: The virginal Mandy Lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school and gets invited to spend a weekend at a ranch by three guys who think they can get lucky and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. So.. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night who want to do nothing but have sex do drugs and drink booze. The only other company is a hunky ranch-hand who may or may not be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm... potential future suspect maybe?<br /><br />So as youre probably ascertained by now all the house-guests end up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways and for a change the black man ISNT the first to die. There are some conventions that still hold up though like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field. Or the lights going out mysteriously in the evening as our heroes unwisely separate to tackle the problem. Even down to the so-called shocking twist at the end the movie is like an old 80s horror updated for the noughties and on this score it succeeds.<br /><br />Unfortunately it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. People get cut up shot bludgeoned etc but because of their innate hatefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations its hard to care as the bodies stack up. Someone gets murdered one of their friends goes out to look for them alone BANG theyre brown bread. Rinse then repeat. Maybe one day well get a screenplay with plausible intelligent likable characters who make rational decisions but still end up being outwitted by a genius killer. Until then we have to tolerate teenagers with the I.Q of pond-life being picked off by a deranged hoodie. Oh well.. 4/10',neg
'Without a doubt the WORST movie I have ever seen in my life. There was nothing entertaining about this film. I know it was supposed to be a comedy but it actually made me cry at the thought of losing the $4.75 admission price.',neg
'Ok at the beginning it looked like Shrek - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. Then it evolves into something really compelling as the gauntlet is set. And the result is an enjoyable movie which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Mannys past for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks) and three characters. Its a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said it can be tear-jerking at some times so kids be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasnt so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek and it shows. The humans are unrealistic and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But dont let this stain the record: as a solo effort Ice Age is commendable. And it will gather many fans I have no doubt. Oh and yes the moments with that small mouse are priceless and show-stealing.',pos
'My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is our movie and the music is our songs. Michelles song is our song. Yeah nowadays its a crime to show naked children on the screen but we were screwing at 16 why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl then rich dad steals him away from her at the end after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child. It is a love story and a growing up story. The music is fantastic and the story is one any person could relate to. May be someday this will be released on DVD.',pos
'My first question is NOT about the horrible acting NOT about the horrendous writing it is the directing. The choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions I have ever seen. Why does EVERY single bad guy have to die in slow motion? I was about to beat myself with a rubber hose. The camera shots make it so that you cant see whats going on. I was JUST about to turn the movie off because of Jalal Merhis accent when it made it to the sex scene so I thought it might get better well it did not. If you rate special effects on an ABC rating scale I would have to put it around a W or so and did I mention the acting? Wow was it bad!!! And the WORST part of the entire Expect to DIE experience is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover which is: THE MATRIX JUST GOT DEADLIER. comparing this movie to the Matrix is easily the WORST comparison I have EVER seen. If you havent seen this movie Dont unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall.',neg
'I had high expectations following My Beautiful Laundrette Bend it like Beckham and (less so) East is East. The histories of British Asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen as well as a number of excellent TV and radio series (Goodness gracious me etc). This one falls flat. Inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill.<br /><br />Ultimately this was a horribly typical BBC effort complete with strong regional accents whacky over-acting characters a those were the days soundtrack and lots of issues in an attempt to be worthy.<br /><br />I found myself cringing at many points during this film. The writing is predictable. Every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. In fact I have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that werent. The characters were thin and cliched: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight overbearing aunt; the pushy Indian parents; the working class neighbour; the wise profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. The script was weak with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. And why it had to be set in the 70s (apart from needing an excuse for a 70s soundtrack) is a mystery. Possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. I dont know.<br /><br />Even these things aside good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. Instead the usual BBC comedy suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. Bend it like Beckham had far better comic acting (and serious acting in fact) than this with a virtually unknown cast.<br /><br />In summary a lazy cliched script over acted in a dull predictable story. Give it a miss.<br /><br />',neg
'I picked up this movie because it caught my eye as movie with a Jewish comedy focus - something I had not seen before. <br /><br />I approached this film with an open mind and was interested in the way it began. The opening is well put together and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh and this is good.<br /><br />However the humor soon became repetitive the plot became confused and strained and I realized I was no longer enjoying the film. I have tried to avoid saying this but the movie became rather cheap - not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up but it didnt. I confess that I may have missed some of the humour not being Jewish myself and having little experience with Jewish culture. However considering how heavily telegraphed the bulk of the humour was in this film its unlikely I missed much.<br /><br />The idea is a good one and perhaps if a little more thought was put into it the film would have been watchable all the way through. I wish I could give the movie a higher rating but strictly speaking it would have been better as a TV series or as a series of skits. There was just not enough worthwhile fresh material for a full-length movie.<br /><br />One thing to say about the casting - the lead role looked as if it had been designed with Ben Stiller in mind but I dont think the movie would have been any more worthwhile if he had been in it.',neg

'Black comedy isnt always an easy sell. Every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful like Fargo for example. But usually they dont often find big audiences. People seem to either set their minds for comedy or for serious mayhem. There doesnt seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a fairly decent hit yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age. Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987.<br /><br />DeVito plays an odd mammas boy named Owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey who passed away shortly after this was released and she is quite a caricature. She is loud ugly rude and overbearing. Though Owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself he wants desperately to have his mother offed. He fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes but he clearly doesnt have the guts to actually do it himself. Thats where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner Owens creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid would-be intellectual novelist who claims his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions off it. He is currently trying to write a new one but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. The night was.... Owen hears Larry wish his ex-wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train Owen decides to travel to Hawaii and murder Larrys ex-wife. Once it appears he has done so he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny and even poignant. Its certainly never dull and often full of surprises.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional even if Ramsey was a bit over the top. Crystal is as good as he can be and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer. The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works often painfully so. The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes and the off-beat tone is truly refreshing. I have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film-making. Throw Momma From the Train takes chances. Both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered? The film isnt too long and it is chock full of laughs. Writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone. 9 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.',pos

'This movie was really well written and was very entertaining.There was great acting in it too. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (like he always does)If you are looking for a eventful movie to watch this should be at the top of your list. There is a mixture of comedy drama and action. You can literally feel what the actors are feeling at points. I was very impressed by this movie. The special effects were very well done. The whole movie was very convincing. This movie is one of my favorites. What happens is North America could be torn apart and Jack and his team have to try and to stop an eruption by destroying North America. It was a very cool and creative idea. I loved this movie and i know you will too.',pos
'Based on the comments made so far everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it. I think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie it has its interesting moments. For one thing it was filmed on location in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I cant remember but it is in the credits). The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. Its beautiful even to me who lived in Colorado for several years.<br /><br />Next it has Disneys penchant for wonderful character actors. Harry Morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Also remember the wonderful Mary Wickes? Although she has a bit part in this movie she is great as always. If you dont know who she is think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback from Notre Dame (she was one of the gargoyles) and she was also the most interesting nun in Sister Act as well as the best nun in The Trouble With Angels. She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve.<br /><br />In addition to character actors and all-star casts in the 1960s-1970s Disney may have not had the greatest movies but if you really watch some of them from beginning to end you will NOTICE that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it. The entire movie may not be funny but there is always a comic gem (at least 1 or 2) in every single live-action movie Disney ever made. Whether its Harry Morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice or Tim Conway floundering around or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror it is all good. The whole film may not be good but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney film from this period that I have ever seen. Disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile despite the dumbness of the film.<br /><br />Bsed on these comments I disagree with viewers who say every Disney movie in this time period is awful. That statement it not quite accurate. Rather it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots.<br /><br />Some live-action Disney movies are true classics (Old Yeller Bedknobs and Broomsticks Mary Poppins) but for those that arent I am able to appreciate them for what they were -- good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar crude and offensive.',neg
'When going to see Rendition I was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with big-name actors. I was not expecting a film that was so engrossing exciting poetic and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and didnt let me go even after I left the theater. A word of advice to anyone who hasnt seen it yet dont let your politics come in the way of enjoying (or not enjoying) this film. Take it for what it is. I saw this with my conservative Jewish family (Im the black sheep the pseudo-liberal college student) and I thought they would write it off as liberal propaganda. Instead they said it was a great film with excellent performances (they like to fancy themselves film critics).<br /><br />Its sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its Oscar-affiliated actors while leaving out the constantly underrated Sarsgaard as well as new talent like the truly excellent Metwally. The entire cast gave good performances with some standing out much more than others; my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which didnt allow for much screen time for each of the characters. In fact I felt like the sub-plot with Fatima and Khalid was just as prominent on screen as Anwars part of the story.<br /><br />The characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have. Streep is truly terrific as a heartless senator and as much as I dont want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her. Gyllenhaal who will probably be one of the Oscar nods for this movie seems a bit unsure in his role at times. Hs trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he doesnt know how he should feel. Sarsgaard gave an excellent performance; his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie. Metwally again was terrific and I hope to see him in more mainstream films. Its a shame that Gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him. Yigal Naor as shown on IMDb has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes. He along with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach all gave great performances.<br /><br />The story of Fatima and Khalid was not given any credit in commercials but it brings a sad humanity to the story. The narrative was interesting as I was trying to really connect the two story until it was plainly told to us at the end. Ive read some comments on here that say the love story was useless but I disagree. I think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general. Khalid was the real terrorist but he was doing it to avenge his brother and even though he is responsible for the attack you see a humane side to him through the story with Fatima. Not that I think we should feel bad for actual terrorists but I think the we are all people theme was definitely relevant.<br /><br />Whatever your feelings on terrorism politics etc. leave it out of the theater. The bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear.',pos
'Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found wandering around covered in dogs blood. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & others. Ranch hand & ex-priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognises Isabelles symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it. Blanche calls priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo) who is her other daughter Claires (Madison Taylor) ex husband to see Isabelle he confirms Miguels suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside Isabelle & an innocent girl free...<br /><br />Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism & I kept asking the same question over & over again why do I do it. Why do I keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder? Right lets honest about this Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete total & utter unashamed rip-off of The Exorcist (1973) & you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share. Theres the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past misdemeanours against others the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctors the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things. I suppose where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (other than its total crap) is that it tries to give all the characters some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but its so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring. The film starts with Isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the characters are poorly written & fleshed out. At times I wondered whether Blackwater Valley exorcism was a spoof theres a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed Isabelle with horse tranquilisers & after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back! There are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. The film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at least.<br /><br />According to some text before the opening credits Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on Actual Events yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called The Exorcist... This piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest. There isnt even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up theres a scene of a cut arm theres a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix & thats about it. Theres surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive. I would imagine the only reason Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breasts are seen. One pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it. There is zero scares no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $1000000 I must say that I am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly & cheap throughout. There are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom. The acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite Jeffrey Combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time. Even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache & a terrible accent he is better than this.<br /><br />Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete rip-off of The Exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic & the makers are thirty five years too late anyway. A total turkey from start to finish.',neg
'Lucio Fulci later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Womans Skin and his masterpiece Dont Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town? The young rich woman who is so bored that she sexually taunts the eventual victims the reporter who likes to tamper with a crime scene to get a better photo shot the townswoman with a mentally retarded daughter the local witch the town idiot....the list goes on and you have to keep mental notes like a true game to play and solve. The themes in this film are very daring and done with that perfect Italian style in the early 1970s. It is certain that no American studio would have even considered making a film of such strong content and that is precisely why this is such a satisfying film (despite some unusual accent choices for the dubbing) and will definitely have people discussing its meanings long after viewing it. As the saying goes they dont make them like this anymore so get a copy and cherish an important film like this one!',pos
'Lets see cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped. Youll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts! Turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world....the world of religious fantasy!--complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of Papier Mache. Everybody gets dragged off to Hell except for one poor chap who goes to Heaven where he can presumably spend Eternity with the blockheads that created this Masterpiece of the Absurd. I think Id opt for Hellfire myself. Go see something else unless you are stoned in which case you might actually like it! Couldnt hurt!',neg
'Pumpkinhead was in itself a decent 80s horror flick. No classic by any means but an enjoyable piece of fluff. Why then have we now been treated to a fourth film in this franchise is beyond me. As in previous sequels theres nothing here to really connect the films except for the monster the witch and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time out we follow the feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys. Part of the film is a Romeo And Juliet romance as a young McCoy boy and his Hatfield lover decide to run away to be together. Soon however they are torn apart and the boys sister is killed. The boy escapes to the woods and gets the witch to resurrect Pumpkinhead for some vengeance. The acting is passable at best amateurish at the worst. The titular demon doesnt even really show up for almost forty minutes and when it does its a pale comparison between it and the original design. Overall Blood Feud fails to impress. It may be worth a watch once but certainly not an addition to the collection.',neg
'I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember dialogue from Tatum ONeal that was just amazingly bad. I remember Richard Burtons character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didnt translate to me. In short I remember Circle of Two because it was so phenomenally awful.<br /><br />This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality. Recall The Blue Lagoon (and other Brooke Shields annoyances) Lipstick Little Darlings Beau Pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex particularly with adults. As a teenager during this time I found the obsession combined with the sexual excesses of the 70s and 80s made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speak.<br /><br />Circle of Two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient like Blue Lagoon. In fact it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way. But honestly it is one of those films you will *never* see if you didnt see it on its first run because it was so truly awful. No one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again.',neg
'In a small picturesque Sicilian village someone is brutally killing young sexually curious boys. The local police force keep busy trying to track the killer and whittle the list down to five or so main suspects including voyeuristic village retard Giuseppe (Vito Passeri) and an elusive grungy voodoo doll-poking backwoods witch named Maciara (Florinda Bolkan). Theres also Don Alberto (Marc Popel) a handsome young priest who runs the local boys school Andrea (Tomas Milian) a journalist helping to aid the police and the beautiful Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) a gorgeous but seriously screwed-up drug addict who seems to have a thing for very (I mean VERY) young boys. As typical with the giallo subgenre the plot wont be fully revealed until the last few frames but if you can hang in there long enough this film pays off. The script (written by Fulci Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti) keeps red herrings to a minimum and will keep you interested and the story is ably supported by excellent location work cinematography (by Sergio DOffizi) and musical score (by Riz Ortolani). The acting particularly Bolkan is also very good. Fulci fans who were weaned on his 80s grotesqueries like THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE will find more artistry and less gore on display here than they might anticipate but theyll still enjoy a particularly nasty chain whipping scene in a cemetery (bizarrely yet effectively set to singer Ornella Vanonis ballad Quei giorni insieme a te) and a long tumble down a rocky embankment that Fulci liked so much that he reused it in his film THE PSYCHIC (1977). Scenes of the children being killed is mainly kept off screen (except for a brief strangulation) but the camera doesnt hesitate to linger on their corpses. The film was not released theatrically in America and presumably because of some anti-Catholic elements in the storyline received only a limited theatrical release in Europe.',pos
'What movie is this??? A horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity which has already been achieved by the Bhatt camp. The movie starrs EMRAAN HASHMI UDITA GOSWAMI AND DINO MOREA. The movie has No Base. It just goes like this... Dino an Udita are married and living in a rich mansion. However Dino doesnt like Udita to the heart as he wants only her wealth. He loves someone else (Tara Sharma). So he bribes Emraan to have an affair with Udita so that he could catch them and finally split up with Udita.. How BORING!! However Emraan falls in love with Udita and vice versa. Lastly when Udita gets imprisonment for killing Emraan Dino pretentiously tries to save her showing his false love to her. Udita on the other hand does not understand this and feels that he loved her truly. So she lends all her wealth to Dino. Finally Dino comes out of the police - station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What a fraud!! The songs are good and are the only thing good in the movie. Now the individual ratings: (Out of 5) Emraan: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino : * 1/2 Overall acting: * 1/2 Direction: * * Story: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final rating: * 1/2 Poor performances and poor casting.......

'OK...before I even start the more or less constructive criticism of the movie Id like to say a few words which come from the heart... THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!! DONT GO TO SEE IT UNLESS YOU REALLY LIKE SWEATY BOY-BANDS AND WOODEN-ACTING NO-PLOT STORIES.. So lets go to why I think the movie is so bad: 1. There is not story line. There is no plot. The director tried to create a mystery it the feeling just wasnt there. 2. The whole thing looks like a big hour and a half promotion for some kind of goth-wanna-be-but-still-looking-like-BSB-band... All guys in school have perfect abs no fat or ugly young people... there is no good looking girl in the movie as well not one. The main character is either wet in the swimming pool or all sweaty in his bed... poor guy. Must be awful to go on a date sweating like that. 3. Can those guys do something good with their powers? Anything good? Like put off the fire in that old barn or help his friend who got into the accident instead of just running around breaking things and showing of in front of each other. 4. Wooden acting. The main character only has two expressions on his face. Expression number one: sad. Expression number two: trying to look seductive but still seems sad... In that boy band there are 4 guys: The main characted his best friend who got into the accident the blondy and the fourth one... what was the name of the fourth one? I think he only spoke twice throughout the whole film: once in the beginning ( he said the jumping from the cliff using the power wont kill them) and second time at the end when he and the blondy lost the girl... the movie could have been done without him and no one would notice... Anyways my verdict: 1 is the perfect score for this film. Guys - do not go to see it. There is very little action no suspense no hot girls. Girls - a least the actors are good looking... What I would advise you people is to get a soundtreck of this movie - thats the only thing I liked about it.',neg
'I couldnt wait to receive the DVD after hearing so much about the film. What a disappointment! This became one of the most confusing films Ive ever viewed. There were so many characters introduced some resembling others that it became impossible to follow the story line. I could not understand how George Clooney received an acting award for the film since he was hardly involved at least in the first half of the movie. My wife and I gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the DVD. I might have considered fast forwarding to see if the ending was any better but after so much confusion decided that chances for improvement were slim. A co-worker told me that a lot of the movie comes together in the last minute or less. I was glad I didnt waste another hour waiting. I gave the DVD away the following day.',neg
'The plot sounded like it had promise. To be honest I did not watch the entire movie. After about an hour into the movie I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth watching until it conclusion? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. Nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human / wolf transplant. It was because the movie was badly written acting lacked emotion and I did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes. When he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying If you cant run with the big dogs dont leave the porch kept running through my bored mind. Save yourself the time and skip this movie. I can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as I did wondering why anyone waste money time energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to American cinema.',neg
'Women? Theyre all scrubbers...! <br /><br />No not a good translation; not at all! This lags behind the previous years Dads Army entirely missing the special small-screen magic of the seminal television sitcom original and failing to play interestingly at all with the big screen... you could just about say that this film well represents a Britain entering decline and more precisely even than that a *British film industry* entering decline. And that is hardly a recommendation is it? To be an exemplar of saddening folly...<br /><br />All that remains after the subtlety of the TV original has been surgically stripped away by Cliff Owen Galton and Simpson are: endless dilapidated musical cues yawn from the Ron Grainer theme... bolstered sentimentality (that shoddy thick-eared ending... how much bolder does the second Steptoe film seem in comparison) an increased seediness - with director and writers seemingly detaching themselves completely - fully applicable to something like the misbegotten monstrosity (yours truly on this site) from 1973 The Mutations. There is a strangely botched cut-adrift tone about the scene where Harold is beaten up in a rugby club that I partly hate and recoil it (so far as a friend intimated from the mood of the TV series...) but this at least seems an original slant and emblematic of tensions just rising to the boil in the Britain of 1972... There is however an implied prostitute aye of a heart-of-gold who turns loose woman-traitor pon poor auld Arold - and beyond-caricature writing of the class element; not to mention surprisingly misjudged performances from the usually redoubtable leads. Brambell and Corbett collude with the script and indeed fail to cure it of an essential ham. What would Anthony Aloysius Hancock have made of it all...? I will merely concede that a few moments just about work - chiefly those where G & S play things a little more carefully and B & C touch tenderer nerves - and it is not on the whole an unwatchable affair. <br /><br />But and oh how this pains me to say it: it is tiresome boring both wilfully detached from reality and what made the TV series great and also fully in tune with the lazy tawdry misogynist fuck it thatll do... actuality of much of what was allowed to pass for mainstream film-making in the Britain of the time.',neg
'Ive watched a number of Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme movies lately and have found a lot to like about them.<br /><br />This SRE movie seemed a lot more slight than all the others Ive seen. Perhaps thats because this is a comedy/horror movie rather than straight horror and perhaps its also because the humor didnt register with me very well.<br /><br />Its a little less than seventy minutes long and the credits begin as the last ten minutes are beginning. There are some outtakes goofs and behind the scenes stuff going on while those credits roll.<br /><br />SRE movies do tend to be short and tend to feel padded out in spite of that. This is no exception with some scenes that tend to go on too long.<br /><br />The story involves a poor kid in Christmastown California whod been picked on by all his classmates. Hed had one shoe stolen and unable to replace it he was dubbed Oneshoe McGroo. Due to an obsession with pirates his parents gave him an eyepatch for Christmas with a Christmas tree emblazoned on the eyepatch.<br /><br />Many of the classmates are killed and the few who remain gather together to decide what to do. Theyre picked off one by one by McGroo who stalks around to the sound of sleigh bells ringing.<br /><br />The characters are pretty much all broad stereotypes like the nerd named Dorkus etc. Theres an odd scene in which a kinky couple has sex; the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded the man wears a large paper watermelon slice over his head. This reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes from director Rinse Dream.<br /><br />The picture quality is good and there are a lot of extras. But basically a pretty silly movie.<br /><br />Oh well I guess you can never have too many Christmas horror movies. Still there are a lot of other needy holidays.',neg
'Well they sent it on TV between midnight and 2:00 am - it seems like the right time to watch it and then go to bed afterwards ...<br /><br />No it was not really living up to my expectations. I think the Dogma concept is good because the film then gets closer to whats really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and mood-making music out. But then again this concept requires some interesting action between the characters.<br /><br />I cannot say that I know King Lear (the Shakespeare version) very well if I had known the play I would probably have been able to predict much of the film.<br /><br />Well a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display - and we certainly see some bad sides. Oh yes the paint of civilisation and culture can be very thin and behind this paint you may find an animal.<br /><br />If you then compare it with Italiensk for begyndere (Italian for beginners) or Mifunes sidste sang (Mifunes last song) you see the same but opposite thing: A crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more constructive way. And if you dare do you may win.<br /><br />When the film had ended I thought to myself: Oh thats why I havent seen it before ... The film has its own beauty. The quality of the work of the cameraman actors etc is good. But the script could need something more. A plot maybe wouldnt hurt.',neg

'The Custer Legend a la Warner Brothers Epic. Theres no casting against type here with the flamboyant Flynn as the flamboyant Custer in this rousing tribute not only to Custer but to the men of the 7th Cavalry. The story traces the life of the famed Boy General from his turbulent days at West Point to his final fight at the Little Big Horn. Great liberties are taken with facts here and we are presented with a Custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates. But this one is done on such a grand scale the battle scenes alone provided employment for every extra in Hollywood. Down beat ending and all this is great fun!',pos
'A great combination: - Chabats humor - Uderzo/Goscinny world and characters - limited presence of Christian Clavier<br /><br />The original Comics was great - one of the better of an overall great series - and Alain Chabat one of the funniest member of the famous French group Les Nuls was able to film replicate and supplement the great work done by goscinny and uderzo by cleverly enforcing the story giving to Djamel Debouze his best role (at last a little bit far from his usual repeatable part) gathering a bunch of great actors (Gerard darmon is wonderful as often Chabat himself is a great Cesar).<br /><br />In addition while being obligated to keep on with Christian Clavier as Asterix Chabat cleverly tuned down his role in the movie to give prominence to Darmon and Debouze... which is always a good idea!<br /><br />=> Great environment great scenario great director great actors great humor beautiful Cleopatra... This movie would have deserved a 10 if Clavier hadnt been involved.',pos
'Obvious tailored vehicle for Ryan Philippe. It seem the studios were hoping he could play a lead tough cop and not look like hes eternally 16 (he cant).<br /><br />Heavyweights Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve as bookends to Phillippe but when theyre not on the screen Phillippe flounders; his shallow acting style has nothing to bounce off of.<br /><br />The script is a typical late 20th century potboiler good cop/bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue lifted out of 1970s TV cop shows such as The Streets of San Francisco. Snipes reprises his role as the eternal black-hat villain playing a slightly less crazed madman than his Demolition Man role. However there wasnt much for Snipes and Statham to chew on. Stathams character announces hed given up nicotine and caffeine - something this movie badly needed injections of.<br /><br />Truly forgettable moment: Ryan Phillippe expounding on Buddhist dogma: Galloway: Are you a Buddhist? Dekker: No. Its just something I picked up along the way.',neg
'I was really geared up to watch when two of best movie critics tagged this movie as a laugh riot. But the movie turned out be disappointing.<br /><br />You will be advised to watch this movie keeping your brains at home but you simply cant ignore the flaws and the shortcomings.<br /><br />1. The missile scene was total stupidity.<br /><br />2. Katrina Kaif and Govinda pair looked awful. (Hes 49 and shes just 24... more than double of her age) 3.

'There are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making.<br /><br />Bronenosets Potyomkin is one of these movies and it should be on anyones list looking to learn more about the history of cinema. <br /><br />Grigori Aleksandrov & Sergei M. Eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a Russian battleship. When the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors the locals embrace the them and support them. Things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business. What follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. Anyone who has seen The Untouchables and Bronenosets Potyomkin knows exactly what I mean.<br /><br />Overall I think this movie raised the bar for film making just as Intolerance did a few years earlier. If you do not mind silent films do yourself a favor and see Bronenosets Potyomkin. <br /><br />If you dont like silent films..... watch Bronenosets Potyomkin anyway. <br /><br />',pos
'Watching Smother was perhaps the longest not-quite-90-minutes of my life. There wasnt a laugh to be had; in fact I dont remember ever cracking a smile. Diane Keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoarder the textbook overbearing mother character a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder. She is manipulative conniving melodramatic childish narcissistic and worst of all boring.<br /><br />I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters but why bother? It was just a long string of movie clichés--the dippy socially inept distant relative whos just trying to break into The Industry the gruff and long-suffering but somehow still lovable father the mild- mannered wife who just cant take it anymore (but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home) the herd of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew throw pillows while everyone is away etc.<br /><br />God what a snore. Ive never been a Diane Keaton fan and Smother only reminded me why. Overacting is overacting no matter how many pictures you did in your prime. Her attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating. What was the director thinking?<br /><br />While I like Dax Shepard and can even sometimes tolerate Liv Tyler their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie. That was okay because neither did I. Keatons endless self-absorbed prattling was intolerable and at times Shepards dislike for her seemed genuine. By the end of the movie I wanted to slap her myself.<br /><br />Awful.',neg

'Im not going to comb over TLPSs obvious peterbogdanovichian flaws. Instead I shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film.<br /><br />1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety. This fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography.<br /><br />2. Bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be by sharing Cybill Shepherds (his then-gal) fabulous body and breasts with his male audience - and not just on one but on two occasions. Brava! The unquestionable highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta.<br /><br />3. TLPS has barely a scene without stereotypical country music doodling in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in Americas Deep South (as if it werent bleedin obvious) so he hammered that point on and on and on...) How is this an advantage you might ask? Well when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases massaging your tired ear-drums you start experiencing a strange exhilaration: The movies finally over! Its pure joy.<br /><br />4. The movie gives all women who look like Cloris Leachman hope. Hope that they too may one day snatch a much younger and maybe even good-looking boyfriend.<br /><br />5. Cloris Leachmans biography (which I realize isnt technically a part of TLPS) gives hope to all women that look like that that they too may one day win a Miss Chicago beauty pageant. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury with.)<br /><br />(You think Im joking abut Cloris having won a beauty pageant huh? Well check out her bio and then well see who laughs last...) <br /><br />6.

'This is one of the worst films I have *ever* seen! It is bad even at TV Movie level standards. The plot is diabolically flawed and the known names in this film are wasted on confused uncertain characters. I dont know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a film together - it is that bad. Billed as a Psychological Horror Thriller - it is certainly Horrific. There is nothing Thrilling about it. And it could do you Psychological damage! The initial opening scenes held such promise - a possible embarkation on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain but the utter shambles that followed the car-crash scene is beyond belief. No matter how hard you try you couldnt care less about the characters. There are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from Chinese philosophers and at worst the film would actually make you go Brain Dead!<br /><br />I have purchased over 300 films on DVD and this is the FIRST one Im going to get my money back on.

'Fräulein Doktor is as good a demonstration as any of how the once great film industry in Western Europe has declined in the past 40 years. Then in the late 60s while the big Hollywood studios were on the ropes ItalyFrance and England were turning out movies to fill the void left by Hollywoods decline. There were the James Bond pictures (Doctor No was a surprise hit in the USA it was first released at the Century theater chain in NYC with a 99 cent afternoon admission price) the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns (with A Fistful of Dollars released by a distributor that never paid the Italian producers a dime)and French crime movies that usually went to art houses with exceptions like The Sicilian Clan. And there were European co-productions like Doctor Zhivago and of course Fräulein Doktor. With its big budget for the time and the world talent involved Fräulein Doktor was good enough that viewers still remember the movie decades later.<br /><br />Kenneth More playing a British intelligence officer has a line in Fräulein Doktor where he tells a caught spy to either talk or he will play the Wall Game. The wall being opposite a firing squad with little chance of the spy winning the game. That sort of cynical attitude played well across national borders in the Vietnam War era of 1969.<br /><br />The steamy scenes between Suzy Kendall and Capucine probably did not damage these performers chances at getting parts in Hollywood movies Hollywood studios were in the process of shedding their overseas distribution and production businesses. Fox would no longer co-produce films like The Sicilian Clan Columbia wouldnt distribute films like Belmondos The Night Caller. MGM went even further cutting almost all film production selling its chain of theaters in India for the value of the land underneath and unloading its Borehamwood studio facilty as Kerkorian looted the studio to raise money for building his casino in Las Vegas (where a Bally casino gift shop sold MGM memorabilia at giveaway prices stuff left over from the auction of MGMs prop warehouses).<br /><br />Paramount distributed Fräulein Doktor but Gulf and Westerns Charles Bludhorn who had taken over the company and canned the studios aged Board of Directors unloaded the studios film library to Universal (as I recall) and really became interested in movies after production chief Robert Evans started turning out one hit after another. But that was in the 70s. Fräulein Doktor with its lesbian scene was buried with cut versions of the movie showing up on local stations through the 80s.<br /><br />Kenneth More was usually typecast as a bumbling guy when he was older especially in the BBC detective series Father Brown. When he was younger as in the British movie Titanic he played his standard reserved British officer. In Fräulein Doktor he had a chance to be a lot tougher than usual as I recall. It would be nice to see if my memory of this movie is accurate about his role and of course those cavalry horses wearing gas masks and protective covers riding into battle. That was some scene and Alberto Lattuada showed he was some director helming this World War I espionage movie where the money spent on production values really shows up on the screen.',pos

And although Hardwickes solo has been cut we can still hear him sing heartily as he dances merrily with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty number Busy Doing Nothing. Its also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming who although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a lovely voice that more than matches her ravishing looksand she looks very fetching indeed in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.<br /><br />Director Tay Garnett gets the most out of his lavish budget using all the resources at his command to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived but whos complaining?) <br /><br />In short as the trailer actually describes an entertainment delight from start to finish.',pos
'Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is based on somewhat pat formula by now of Japanese school drama anime. The formula somewhat goes like this:<br /><br />1. The main protagonist comes from world outside the normal society and has super powers.<br /><br />2. Theres a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role.<br /><br />3. A normal character is in there who shares the main role in the story.<br /><br />4. Unusual things happens in an usual social settings.<br /><br />5. Sometimes the story is about the main protagonist and the normal character that connects to the existence or destruction of the world.<br /><br />6. Absolutely no effort is spent by anyone to gain all the magical powers. They just have it.<br /><br />7. Usually people outside of this tight nit group is not aware of their super powers and goes on with their daily lives.<br /><br />So there you have it. Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi is made along these lines which became the success formula for comics and anime in Japan. Even though it follows a pat formula the series is superbly crafted and the episodes are always set in an interesting back drop within the normal social settings which always morphs into unusual circumstances surrounding Haruhi Suzumiya. Each player in the story brings some unusual insight into the daily life that usually we are not aware of. The philosophical twist of their insights are what makes this series extra entertaining. The visuals are first rate and done beautifully. <br /><br />The crazy ideas Haruhi always seem to come up with along with complicated settings of the story may give you headache from time to time. Its further complicated by the fact that the episodes are played out of sequence which further adds to the confusion. When I watched the episodes in the chronological sequence some of the plots finally made sense. I recommend you do the same. Its much more entertaining to watch the series this way. Google<br /><br />List_of_The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya_episodes<br /><br />for the correct sequence of all the episodes. And oh you might notice the headache while youre watching this like I did. Let me know if you had it too.',pos
'Just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the Michigan Bar Exam. I wanted something that was mindless and that I could just sit back and say what the hell were they thinking? I was not disappointed in this undertaking but had I been watching this one in a serious mood I would have been irate. The company that made this thing just spliced CGI footage from the first Octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in Bride of the Monster look like a masterpiece of special effect footage. Since when does an octopus have fangs? The plot is that an NYPD diver is investigating some murders/disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before the Fourth of July. He and his partner (who is soon to be transferred or soon to be munched on by a fig bucking octopus) investigate in a rather inept manner (all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people) and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the Mayors office. Of course on one believes that an octopus can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the mayors office. Surprisingly all hell doesnt break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killed.<br /><br />Really lame. Dont bother with it.',neg
'Just watched this early Bugs Bunny (first time hes named here) and Elmer Fudd cartoon on the ThadBlog as linked from YouTube. This was Chuck Jones first time directing the wascally wabbit and as a result Bugs has a different voice provided by Mel Blanc than the Brooklyn/Bronx one were more familiar with. In fact according to Thad hes channeling Jimmy Stewart (his shy boy type personality of that time). Anyway after Elmer buys his pet Bugs goes all obnoxious on him by turning the radio real loud pretending to die after his master repeatedly throws him out of his shower and saying Turn off those lights! whenever Elmer catches him in his bed. Even with the different voice Bugs is definitely his mischievous self and I laughed myself blue the whole time! According to Thad there was an additional scene at the end of Elmer just giving the house to Bugs after the hell he went through but that was probably considered too sad since he suffers a mental breakdown at that point so its just as well that cut scene is lost. Anyway I highly recommend Elmers Pet Rabbit.',pos
'This low-budget indie film redefines the word blah. It will surprise most that this word can actually be found in the dictionary defined as: nonsense.. uninteresting dull lifeless. The movie redefines the word because I would have to add to those four words: PC crap pretentious on a pathetic level and pointless.<br /><br />The film tries so hard to be hip and in touch with contemporary beautiful-people-struggling-for-je-ne-sais-quoi behaviour and thinking (do they think?). There is almost no plot to speak of though there IS one to sleep to. The phoniest and most politically-correct things about it are how a white woman is great friends with a young black stud the black street-sax-player with a penchant for oh-so wise council and advice and the fat black psychic. Isnt it beautiful how the races can get along after all?... Ahhhh... In the end the woman reads out poetry which is nothing more than one of her dull dear diary entries. She gets a standing ovation(!!!) although in real life her listeners would have more likely than not dozed off into deep slumber. But this movie has little to do with real life even though that is where its supposed to be happening. In real life her poetry reading would have gotten standing ovations only if she had the sense to include the juicy sexual details. And then I rubbed his huge penis against my sweaty impatient pink little vagina... Cheers! Whats worse the lead actress has a dozen scenes in which she either bathes or screws with someone yet they never have the sense to show her breasts which was clearly the only thing left to save this mess.<br /><br />The black guy and the blonde who are separated by about a meter in height hook up: they look like a cheap variation of Rodman and Madonna (as if the latter two arent a cheap enough combination already). Nicole Eggert mentioned by Howard Stern in his Miss America book is the blonde. Stern writes of Eggert that she took her implants out. Yet I believe that when they took her implants out they also sucked most of the meat out of her flesh and muscles by mistake for she looks starved here.<br /><br />The sax player in one scene develops angel-like wings; he looks like Al Roker advertising angel food cakes.',neg
'I like a lot of the actors/actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns .The main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers .In 20 or 30 years Nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90s . I can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riots and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .The soundtrack will feature bands like Nirvana  N.W.A  Public Enemy  Soundgarden etc .The movie like this will be just as cheesy as The 60s and I gurantee you NBC will do it .See the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you arent thinking i am living in the 60s or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .Next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project',neg
'Despite being a 2001 movie the direction is the kind of 90s art-house style that was considered old and out-of-date a few years ago. The cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch. The script is decent enough and a few scenes did kind of captivate me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). But the story line with the detective whos sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible. The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blairs married boyfriend seriously bothered me. I did sit through the whole thing though which is rare for the kind of random what-is-this movie you just find on TV and decide to watch.',neg
'If they could get Ed Asner why didnt they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers? And why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger. It forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability. I guess thats why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work. If the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long-distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better. He has good reason to be jealous good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective controlling manipulative father. All the characters that are meant to be likable arent and everyone else is the bad boyfriend. How did they meet anyway a wine broker and a saw mill worker?',neg
'In this tense and character-driven romantic tragi-comedy we are given an insight into the intertwining lives of four thirtysomething Parisians. At the centre is Vinz Cassells portrayal of Max. A starry-eyed Romeo he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his put-upon best friend Lucien (Écoffey in an understated but effective performance) he wins her heart and they live happily ever after... that is until the scheming neurotic and obsessive Alice (the versatile Romane Bohringer) becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three.<br /><br />The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw the eye-candy of picture-postcard Paris at the heart of it all. The use of colour does not go unnoticed particularly in Lisas spectacular apartment (presumably accounting for the films title) where the reds and yellows provoke the fires of passion and lust.<br /><br />The audience can relate to Max: he truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstance for it. In one memorable scene our fated lovers (agonisingly separated by a choreographed misunderstanding) narrowly miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them. Independent of one another they travel to the same destination: her on the Metro him in a taxi practically tête-à-tête. Yet fate seems to have it in for them and the audience is captivatingly teased.<br /><br />The performances in this film are really what make LAppartement stand out. I still cannot understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France. He has presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassells real-life spouse at the time of writing) has recently found fame in the Anglophone film industry but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true she is divinely beautiful but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic leading-lady style which many British and American actresses dismiss in favour of the all-too-easy subtle approach.<br /><br />All in all watch this film! I doubt youll be disappointed. It is gripping satisfying amusing sad lavish and a lesson in artistic film-making.',pos

'Who should watch this film? Anyone who has ever taken acid read Philip K. Dick thought the premise of the Matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in Philosophy or likes having their sense of reality messed with. I laughed out loud at this film just because it was so outrageous and so spot-on. This film is great. This film is cool. It is better than the Matrix by a long shot (I didnt fall asleep in Existenz for a kick off: action/special effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical gloss that is exactly what the Matrix is). Existenz is gross it is disturbing and it is funny. David Cronenberg has done some shonky stuff (Rabid) and some works of genius too (Videodrome is another one worth checking out as is Stephen King adaptation The Dead Zone). But this is one of my all-time favourites. I cant remember the ending- which is a good thing cos it means I can watch it again. Or perhaps I never watched this film at all. Maybe its an implanted memory. Or maybe it really happened to me. I dont know. At any rate it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality and Im glad.',pos
'The premise of this movie is revealed on the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miracle fabric that doesnt degrade. But the movie fails to get on with it. Instead it pads for 45 minutes noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery. Since audiences dont benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out its a strange choice: the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic. Once the fabric is discovered the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs and blue-collar co-workers want the invention squelched leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements; inventing the chemical and running from oppressors.<br /><br />I cant understand why anyone would describe this as comedy. The tone isnt funny or comical. Its more like serious social criticism of the day: that capitalism warps both supply chains and production. Which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes thats probably true but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact the movie is simply an earnest argument. Youll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any here.<br /><br />This is more like a British Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe ?).',neg

'MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately. Praise for the film was absolutely nonexistent even from the people involved in making it. This film was loathed from day one. While every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds (aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism) the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do. Its not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like SCARFACE or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like SHOWGIRLS. <br /><br />Undoubtedly the reason is that the film though outrageously awful is not lovable or even likable. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is just plain mean. As a Hollywood satire it is cold-blooded and mean-spirited but in a hollow pointless way. MYRA takes for granted that Hollywood is a corrupt town but goes further to attack such beloved icons as Laurel and Hardy Shirley Temple Judy Garland and Gary Cooper. The film seems to imply that everything about Hollywood is by its very nature vile. It seems to think that there is something inherently courageous about mocking sacred cows but doesnt supply a rationale for doing the mocking in the first place. The film is also viscously anti-American and anti-establishment and anti-this and anti-that but all in a superficial late-1960s trendy way. Like CASINO ROYALE; SKI-DOO; I LOVE YOU ALICE B. TOKLAS and other would-be hip epics MYRA is a middle-aged vision of the hippy-dippy youth culture. It tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles. But instead of being cheerfully self-mocking MYRA makes no attempt to conceal its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has the humor of a bully; theres not a single moment of innocence in it. Its intentions arent honorable. TIME magazine aptly described it as being about as funny as a child molester but its not nearly as sympathetic.<br /><br />For instance poor Mae West bore the brunt of so much of the criticism aimed at the film being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to a reanimated walking corpse. The octogenarian star obviously didnt know just how ridiculous she looked playing a lecherous talent agent lusting after men young enough to be her grandsons or even her great-grandsons. But director Michael Sarne had to know but he used her anyway. Why? Because she apparently was the joke. Just like John Huston John Carradine Grady Sutton Andy Devine and other veteran performers in the film they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images. They are cast as smarmy self-parodies as is Rex Reed the arrogant fey film critic who is cast as just that in the film. But the real Reed the celebrity hound jet-setting talk show gossip can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way; but as Myron Myras alter ego he is just obnoxious. Again apparently for Sarne Reed is the joke.<br /><br />You watch MYRA BRECKINRIDGE and you dont see actors you see victims. None more so than Raquel Welch. No one will ever accuse Welch of being a great actress but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered. Being in almost every scene Welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film but to her credit she gives a remarkably nuanced performance. Though of course centered between the scenery chewing Huston and the almost catatonic West Welch doesnt have to do much to strike a good balance. Even so she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan smirk with just the hint of self-righteous glee that would do any James Bond villain proud. Legend has it that Welch was snubbed by a condescending West and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director Sarne not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and collected performance.<br /><br />The films only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the films agenda is. The whole story is a fantasy fable which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver but what that might be is anybodys guess. With all of its talk about destroying the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race it would seem to have a feminist axe to grind. But as a feminist Myra is a monstrous figure a sexual predator. Besides Myra isnt a woman rather she is a delusion of Myron who presumably is a gay male. That might explain the male rape scene as well as the characters love/hate attitude toward the macho seemingly straight deadhead Rusty but it doesnt explain his/her obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with Farrah Fawcetts Mary Ann. The film is obsessed with sex but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution; all the sex is treated as being if not dirty than at least perverse and degrading. Turning to Gore Vidals original novel isnt of any help because it is as confused and pointless as the movie.<br /><br />And this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies. Not just movies as a business but movies as part of the culture as well. The film itself is wall-to-wall arcane references to old movies all of which director-screenwriter Sarne approaches with a seething disdain. He has raided the film vaults of 20th Century-Fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films not as an homage or to provide a social commentary but to mock the innocence of old Hollywood. How can an artist -- if you generously want to call Sarne that -- make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in? The very effort is totally self-defeating.<br /><br />MYRA BRECKINRIDGE doesnt seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty. It hates Hollywood it hates America it hates sex it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and Laurel and Hardy and well you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it. In a very sad and sorry way MYRA BRECKINRIDGE may be the first punk manifesto a celebration of pop culture nihilism.',neg
'...This would be the worst film id ever seen. Hmmm OK maybe tied with Boogeyman then. Awful truly awful.<br /><br />I had low expectations and it failed to meet them! I honestly cant think of one good thing. so here are the worst points...<br /><br />1. THE ACTING 2. THE PLOT 3. THE CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics....seriously) 4. THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOGUE and finally.... 6. THE PLOT <br /><br />There are so many unanswered questions Did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they hadnt put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than Supermans son and the henchman he kills?!!<br /><br />Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it?<br /><br />When Superman goes to hospital why dont the doctors ask What the F*** do you want us to do?! Hes a F***ing alien! We dont know jack about his anatomy!? <br /><br />What happened in the 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years? <br /><br />Where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?<br /><br />and finally Why? Just Why? <br /><br />BTW for those of you wondering how come Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite i think ive figured it out...<br /><br />...since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks it is clearly all in his head. therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock....<br /><br />either that or the writers are slack-jawed half-wits who didnt think that was a fairly obvious mistake.',neg

'The gate to Hell has opened up under Moscow. A priest played by Vincent Gallo goes to the city to find a friend who has gone missing in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the gateway.

Nothing is clear and honestly I didnt see the point of it all other than provide a pay check for those involved (Second billed Val Kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that dont amount to much other than to allow him to be billed as in the film.)

'Priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name his first thought would be comedy. That is what this man is known for or rather was known for. After giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like Hungama Hera Pheri and Hunchul his train derailed slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I cant recollect for now. Now with hideous films like Dhol the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- torture.<br /><br />Dhol is a mixture of bad unfunny toilet jokes somewhat of drama poor suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny though not witty and secondly except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma the acting was decent. <br /><br />Speaking of the acting I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie) then came Tusshar Kapoor then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. The grandma firstly resembled a ghost plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.<br /><br />The plot was the same seen before one. Four boys behind girls and in need of money but with a few twists. There is a bad man who is preposterously stupid and dumb. And at last the good wins over the bad and everything is fine. The idea of having a Dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty.<br /><br />The worst thing about the movie is its length. After an hour or so you get exhausted and want to leave the theater. But being a critic it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie. THe movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place.<br /><br />If your mother-in-law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything then send her for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.',neg

Before he could answer two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio knew best and how no one will take such a film seriously. I had been reading the Bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend (ComiCon attendees of the 1970s will recall Blackhawk and his band? I was in a couple of years of that with him) and had higher hopes than what we got.<br /><br />The flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously and so doing camp was the only way.

The bleak German expressionistic colours the black and white footage from the vision screens there is no reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984. The main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage. This film decides to take a mock-communistic approach to set design atmosphere and theme yet the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist worship-the-humble-worker theme itself. This book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap. The soundtrack is annoying the lack of foresight is annoying this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or believability when that is exactly what is required to hammer the novels messages to the viewer.',neg
'Its not the most well made slasher movies of all time but for what it is its pretty amusing. The plot is lame but the kills are not too bad. I have to be honest if you dont follow the bands that are featured in this film you wont find this film as funny as those who do. I knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin with friends backstage...its not made to be taken seriously. Its ubber cheese at its punk best and with over 100 killsmost of which are ultra gory its a fun movie to have friends over to watch drink and be merry!',neg
'Lin McAdam (James Stewart) wins a rifle a Winchester in a shooting contest.Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) is a bad loser and steals the gun.Lin takes his horse and goes after Dutch and his men and the rifle with his buddy High Spade (Millard Mitchell).The rifle gets in different hands on the way.Will it get back to the right owner? Anthony Mann and James Stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece Winchester 73 (1950).Stewart is the right man to play the lead.He was always the right man to do anything.The terrific Shelley Winters plays the part of Lola Manners and shes great as always.Dan Duryea is terrific at the part of Waco Johnnie Dean.Charles Drake is brilliant as Lolas cowardly boyfriend Steve Miller.Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the movie and theyre played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell.The young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and the young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan.There are many classic moments in this movie.In one point the group is surrounded by Indians since this is a western.Its great to watch this survival game where the fastest drawer and the sharpest shooter is the winner.All the true western fans will love this movie.',pos
'The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice. The director puts us in check mate with the story of Alexander an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction. Nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted. She meets Alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket. A magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day the mother alarmed telegrams the husband. He arrives and questioning Alexander we get these fades to the past ala Godfather II where we see young Alexander a child prodigy. He is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums. Thinking Alexander reached his peak abandons him but becomes legend. The old teacher returns causing harm trying to give victory to an old rival of Alexander. In a serious chess game where World Chess Champion victory is one way to immortality the chess clock ticks match time ends to conclude the next day. That day is Nastasyas wedding the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. Nastasya holding her stomach and looking thru her loves coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves. Though the film unfortunately sways from its Russian roots its low back cut dresses are lovely Alexander plays his role sublimely.The director underestimated her audience we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense is after trading queens isolate the opponents King with your 3 paws & King sacrificing the castle for mate. Nastasya is a great match but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her. The Luzhin Defense elegantly gives Navokov honor the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed.',pos
'This Harold Lloyd short wasnt really much; not one of his funnier efforts. Of course I never see bratty kids as anything hilarious. Thats what the bulk of this story is Harold and his wife Mildred Davis babysitting his in-laws two young kids. One is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolish the house. Letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me.<br /><br />The best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (Noah Young) is burglarizing their house. Half the time its the pet cat scaring the couple but overall that segment is fun with some good sight gags reminding me of another Lloyd short Haunted Spooks.<br /><br />However the good ending doesnt save the whole picture which I probably wouldnt watch again. Lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again. It just isnt that funny.',neg
'My paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the DVD box sums it up: this film was far more horrible than horrifying.<br /><br />This is the worst film I have seen in as long as I can remember. My wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the Tom Cruise version. The laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off. The gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious.<br /><br />But as the film wore on we were benumbed by clumsy acting -- both over- and under-acting -- non-continuity in directing and editing trite writing and crude special effects. We gave up after a half-hour or less; after starting this badly it couldnt possibly get better.<br /><br />Since I despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics here are some examples of the films especially awkward moments even if they amount to spoilers:<br /><br />- The lead says good-bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother the latter prickly because its their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business. The son asks quietly worried will I ever see you again? Perhaps its supposed to come off as a premonition but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situation.<br /><br />- A huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater. A crowd of people stands nearby peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally unaroused. One woman finally says its gi-normous!<br /><br />- After this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants the lead and a bystander now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape have an exchange something like this in a quietly puzzled tone:<br /><br />What was that thing anyway? I dunno...<br /><br />- A crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military since part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship shoots an explosive at it the crowd starts to run away seemingly only because a director told them to and not because theyre frightened or in any kind of real danger let alone unusual circumstances.<br /><br />And so forth... writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it. But please PLEASE save yourself the bother even if your morbid curiosity is piqued! The film is so bad it cant even be enjoyed as unintentional humor (versus say King Vidors Solomon & Sheeba starring Yul Brynner wearing a wig). Life is too short to waste watching such nonsense. There MUST be something more productive and enjoyable to do like walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage.',neg
'What an excellent movie made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies weve ever seen. Why this movie wasnt given the attention it deserved on its release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing. It is obvious that we as a general public are being force-fed that which has been deemed great and wonderful by the powerful and influential while true gems such as Unconditional Love manage to shine thru all those pretenders to really enjoyable cinema. Rent or buy this movie.....you wont regret it!',pos

'This movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences. This movie was the mans version of Mommy Dearest. It depicts both graphically and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are God. <br /><br />Someone told me it was funny. No way I say! It is sick humor at best. <br /><br />The movie is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use for this movie is for people who dont understand mental illness or dont believe what we families actually do live through.',neg
'Hello there<br /><br />This is my first post in IMDb even though I use it as a reference for quite a while. I would therefore like to salute you all. The fact that I am a Greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement I hope not to your annoyance.<br /><br />I spent 2 years of my life (all we Greeks did actually) analysing Omirus epos (and not Homers as you see everywhere) rhyme by rhyme. If I recall well it was Iliada (Iliad) on 8th grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) on 9th grade. Warners Troy was a big disappointment to me and my fellow Greeks around the campus (I study in the UK).<br /><br />Iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made. It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war. Historians put Trojan war around 1200 BC and the actual reason of the war not being Helens beauty but the strategically crucial position of Troy. That said one may now understand that Omirus epos is not presenting the actual events (as its not accurate historically) but this was never the purpose of this work. <br /><br />Reading this huge poem one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour love anger hate heroism discipline loyalty and so on. The best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle. None of these though were revealed in Troy<br /><br />Warners Troy was really cheap to my eyes and to other intellectual people English Finnish and German colleagues of me as well. It is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computers graphics did the whole work) and yet it is Wolfgang Petersens best work. <br /><br />I conclude saying that youd better watch something else instead. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It is a really expensive B movie.<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />Alex',neg
'I think this is one of the weakest of the Kenneth Branagh Shakespearian works. After such great efforts as Much Ado About Nothing etc. I thought this was poor. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone Nivoli McElhone???) but my biggest gripe was that they messed with the Bards work and cut out some of the play to put in the musical/dance sequences.<br /><br />You just dont do Shakespeare and then mess with the play. Sorry but that is just wrong. I love some Cole Porter just like the next person but jeez dont mess with the Shakespeare. Skip this and watch Prosperos Books if you want to see a brilliant Shakespearean adaptation of the Tempest.',neg
'I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films. This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense. The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure. The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963. It was even more scary. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.',pos
'*MILD SPOILERS*<br /><br />In this would-be satire Chaplin set his sights on the evils of German fascism playing the twin roles of Tomanian dictator Adenoid Hynkel and one of his subjects an inadvertent World War I hero and Jewish barber. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and the Marx Brothers Hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighbouring Osterlich whilst finding time for numerous oddly flat set-pieces. The dictators much-celebrated waltz with an inflatable globe is actually entirely heavyhanded underwhelming and unfunny.<br /><br />Chaplin should certainly be commended for looking to lampoon Hitler and for speaking out strongly on celluloid - his much-maligned final speech is actually the bold memorable highlight of the piece - but the film simply isnt sharp or funny enough to merit the praise frequently heaped upon it nor to demand repeated viewings. The best gags are away from Hynkels tiresome posturing and involve The Barber attempting to avoid a large spinning bomb (a sequence which steals from the gun tussle in The Gold Rush) and later with a pot on his head accidentally walking the plank off the roof of his shop.<br /><br />Compared to the directors silent classics The Great Dictator is slow wildly inconsistent and altogether somewhat unsatisfactory whilst the barren spells between laughs are often long and difficult to endure. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and The Great Dictator certainly ranks as such.',neg
'I dont know who Sue Kramer the director of this film is but I have a strong suspicion that A) she is a lesbian and B) she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic.<br /><br />I can imagine everyone thinking My God this is horrible. Not funny. Pedestrian. Totally lame. But keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti-gay or they dont get the gay lifestyle. (This is probably why Kramer did NOT cast gay people to play gay people too.) Anyway its not even worth reviewing. The actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do. Its full of clichés and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing - much less funny.<br /><br />I hated it and Im not afraid to say so. Too bad the gutless people who gave Kramer the money to make this bomb werent as unbiased in their judgment.',neg
'American film makers decided to make a film they think is Japanese. The characters all badly represented the actors are not even Japanese and the set is cheap unreal and definitely doesnt represent Kyoto in Early 20ties and 30ties. Who ever read the book understand that the script writers didnt add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script. Worse they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs. Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well known Chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie and tho they represent Japanese culture. Seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous. Quentine Tarantinos last scene in Kill Bill #1 is ten times more Japanese made than that of this movie.',neg

'Come Undone appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum. Granted its a film that promises a take on gay life as most viewers expect and somehow it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young mans soul. The film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended. It is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that in the end will leave Mathieu confused hurt and depressed when things dont go according to what he hoped the relationship would be.<br /><br />If you havent seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading.<br /><br />Sebastien Lifshitz the director of the film has told his story from Mathieus viewpoint. Most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film but there are hints that are not obvious as one can see in retrospect. The story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film. This is a story about the doomed the love Mathieu felt for Cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life together.<br /><br />First of all Cedric the handsome young local pursues Mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him. Mathieu feels the attraction for Cedric too. We realize how different both young men are by the way Cedric tells Mathieus family how he feels school is not for him. On the other hand Mathieu who wants to be an architect finds beauty in the abandoned place where Cedric has taken him. We watch as Mathieu reading from the guide book wants Cedrics attention.<br /><br />When Mathieu comes out to his mother she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career. She also points out about what future both of them would have together which proves to be true. Mathieu appears to have learned his lesson the hard way. He goes on to an uncertain life with Cedric and attempts to take his own life. We watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul.<br /><br />The ending might be confusing for most viewers but there is a moment in the film when Mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to Pierre the young man who frequents the bar. That is why when Mathieu goes looking for Pierre at his house appears to be hard to imagine. Yet we have seen the way Mathieu is obviously interested in Pierre. The last scene at the beach when Pierre and Mathieu are seen strolling in the sand has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy apparently lost but then realizing the father is nearby.<br /><br />Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films. This is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level. Mathieu has suffered a lot first with the separation of his parents then with his depressed mother and with losing Cedric. Stephan Rideau who has been seen on other important French films is equally good as the shallow Cedric.<br /><br />While Come Undone will divide opinions the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care Sebastien Lifshitz gives to the story.',pos
'This is a great premise for a movie. The overall plot is very originalinteresting and something to think about.

'If Daphne Du Maurier had set REBECCA in 1950s San Francisco it might very well resemble this uptight highly unusual noir from Robert Wise. Valentina Cortese plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and insinuates herself into the life of Richard Basehart (who happens also to be the guardian of the dead womans son)...its absurd and over-the-top but also topflight entertainment. Cortese is terrific slowly falling apart as she realizes the mistake shes made. Basehart is fine if a bit bland...although the lighting toward the end makes him appear very menacing. Fay Baker makes a very good Mrs. Danvers-like caretaker. Wise is a fine director and he keeps things moving at a pretty brisk clip. He also stages a now classic out of control car crash with Cortese (or at least a stunt Cortese) at the wheel.',neg
'There are moments when you dont want those deep drama-series. When you dont want series with heavy stories or a must to watch every single episode to be able to hang on. There are moments when you just want to watch a simple series with lots of action and cool characters. For those moments you have Cleopatra 2525.<br /><br />I was one of those who actually enjoyed Charlies Angels. Critics said it was to superficial and silly. But the thing is thats the point! People who cant relax and expected a serious movie hated it. Its exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525. It is superficial. It has silly and unrealistic characters. And thats why I like it. It isnt like any other series.<br /><br />The first season wasnt very good. The character Cleo was irritating and a little too much. The story was a little lame and you didnt get to know the characters very much. But hey they only had 20 minutes in every episode.<br /><br />In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525 they finally gave the series full 40-minutes length. And it was here I started to love it. The series finally started to grow into a very qualitative series. Too bad they had to cancel the series. Because the last episodes of Cleopatra 2525 actually was very good.

'Some films manage to survive almost on originality alone - Wonderland is certainly one of those films. The script manages to throw everything into a near-fever pitch but without making it incoherent. The speed of this thriller is not to chosen to cover up a weak script but rather to accurately reflect the drug-addled reality.<br /><br />As director James Cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors. Most of the characters are perpetually on edge and often because theyre rather quite ugly personalities. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes to be a hustler able to manipulate and control. No offense to Kilmer but his version of Holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak-minded. Nonetheless its a stunning performance. Comparing this to Kilmers more Hollywood roles like in The Saint it seems to prove he is far more at home in gritty indie flicks.<br /><br />The actors are the main force holding all together. There are various little performances that stand out - especially the women. Carrie Fisher Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow all have limited screen time next to their male counterparts but they are all fantastic. Aside from Kilmer Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give a weird stunning energy to their roles.<br /><br />I originally put off watching Wonderland because I assumed it was a film about a porn actor in the strictest sense. Yes the story revolves around John Holmes but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career. Basically this film is a murder mystery and as such - its excellent.<br /><br />RATING: 7.5 out of 10',pos

They do not celebrate it again for many years. There is an interesting comment by the daughter that will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation.<br /><br />The Matthew character makes a reference to Jesus but I suspect that other comments he makes come from non-Christian sources. I wonder if any other viewers would recognize those comments. If so it would be an interesting addition to the data on this movie.',neg

But this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion. This girl was someones daughter. I dont think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold-blooded to someone elses daughter. Or alternately could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter. And the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victims parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief.<br /><br />That said the characters were acted with conviction by the actors. I thought changing Scott Bakulas eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is. You couldnt see into his eyes at all.',neg
'I must say I thought I had seen it all. I am an extremely jaded movie buff. This movie didnt shock me by any means. Im way past that point. But it did take me to certain emotional places I didnt know I could go to. I had no idea I could ever find (ick) the idea of beastiality erotic. Never never never. Ever. Ever. But there you go. He did it. I have to give the director credit. He pulled it off.<br /><br />For the first 40 minutes this movie is a TOTAL bore. We start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex. After five minutes of this I started wondering if buying this movie wasnt a mistake. Then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married. Then some nervous guy shaves. Then we see (briefly) a hot chick getting it on with a butler (but this is very brief). At this point I was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake. In fact I fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night.<br /><br />We finally get the good stuff when a girl (who knows who she is or who anyone is in this movie) has a dream about a Victorian-era gal being ravaged by a beast-thing in the forest. The scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat (heh-heh) of the whole deal. Its beautifully shot superbly edited and does deliver the goods. They do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesnt either. Oh well. I would definitely recommend this film. The first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself (and my TV) but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it.',pos
'Begotten is certainly an experience and a out of the ordinary experience at that. The use of colour is fascinating and at times frustrating. A LOT of what happens on screen is incredibly difficult to make out. Your view is either obscured by a sudden bizarre change in colour and tone characters in the way and random cuts to the sky. The sound is very haunting and a welcome addition. It really aids the nihilistic and hopeless tone that smothers this film. <br /><br />As for what Begotten is about the rape of the environment and rebirth theory feels pretty accurate to me. But I wouldnt spend a lot of time focusing on the meaning its virtually unimportant. Its clear the director didnt want to explain anything. He simply presents it as it is and if you want to search for a meaning thats up to you. <br /><br />Watching Begotten is definitely not a walk in the park but I was captivated from the opening. It really is like watching a persons worst nightmare. What we see is at times distressing and very unpleasant but there is a surreal dreamlike beauty in there. If youre an art-house/experimental fan and you havent yet seen Begotten make it a priority. I doubt you will ever forget it. I sure know that I wont.',pos
'No wonder a lot of us hate classical music; and what are the children to think? With educational PR like this serious music will soon slip from life support to the morgue. Kids know when theyre being talked down to and this is no exception; why cant someone good do a movie about classical music for kids? I must admit I enjoyed the actor who played Beethoven he took to the role with enthusiasm and a keen balance of the poignant and humorous aspects of Beethovens character; he obviously did his research. Otherwise this is a third rate rehash of the old ABC Afterschool Special format with none of the occasional charm those short films had. Sorry about the rant but this is an important subject for young people to know about and it could have been done well; I wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible?

'Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. Had me snifflin like a baby as I left the theatre trying not to let anyone see. So when I saw it again now in 07 I knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached. Thankfully this time I was at home.<br /><br />What I hadnt remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps hadnt noticed because of it was the technical brilliance of this movie. The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue. The camera work which seemed to place the viewer together with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground framing the street scene. <br /><br />The story itself & the characters - seedy sad & brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn. Then again Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been 70 when I saw it. I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends. All these years later Im glad Im not alone tonight. This is one hell of a great movie.',pos
'It is not surprising that this film was made by Im Kwon Taek at the time it was.

What is most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon his 2002 offering is not presented in the pansori style of those previous two films.<br /><br />Nonetheless the experienced hand of Im comes through. We explore together the life of a real person: a late nineteenth century Chosun Dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who because of that causes a stir in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for would-be Japanese ruling colonials alike. The painter Chang Seung Up known popularly as Oh Won (performed magnificently by Choi Min Sik the famous star of Park Chan Wooks already legendary OldBoy) becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. Contemporary Korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact or maybe because of the fact that he was so ostracized in his time. Ims sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. Im is a master at capturing his countrys past idiosyncrasies and in this film he almost outdoes himself. As expected in an Im film the cinematography is breathtaking the editing is precise and the story is central.<br /><br />Plots are set against Seung Up family ties are tested and broken scandalous behavior is alleged (and is sometimes real) all to bring down the man who painted fire. But against all the intricacies of Ims detailed but sometimes convoluted account of Seung Ups life Seung Up himself somehow manages to survive. He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after only one look. Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off Oh Won. In other words lines of people who wish to take advantage of the real Seung Up an artistic star begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His cleverness in staving off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience if not the cast. <br /><br />What does Seung Up think? He possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished. He despises those who would try to turn art into profit. And he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals. Horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. Ims signature historical epic motif and his influence in the realm remains on prominent display in this multi-million dollar epic. <br /><br />The protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint. This is when the story takes on a whole new meaning one that is not just political but social in nature. Im takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion. <br /><br />He Oh Won becomes a Jesus figure. The people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be. Eventually both government and people come down upon Seung Up in a manner taken straight out of the Bible. His holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; he dies for (or escapes from) the sins of the commoners the art critics the politicians who hound him. <br /><br />But does he die? As with most of Ims films a question remains. In this case does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not tackle that question; it merely presents a possible end for the real man of Chang Seung Up or Oh Won. No death is depicted because no death is known. <br /><br />It is difficult to find fault with this film but Im has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does it hardly surprises anymore. As usual for Ims films the cinematography the editing and the writing are all first rate. Its a well-crafted film imbued with Ims uncanny story-telling ability. Granted he may be best at doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. Still the film contains stretches of this admirable art form and by the end viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great untold story. And they have because that precisely is Ims gift.',pos
'<br /><br />When I unsuspectedly rented A Thousand Acres I thought I was in for an entertaining King Lear story and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was in it so what could go wrong?<br /><br />Very quickly however I realized that this story was about A Thousand Other Things besides just Acres. I started crying and couldnt stop until long after the movie ended. Thank you Jane Laura and Jocelyn for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie! Thank you cast for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness!<br /><br />I recognized the Angry sister; the Runaway sister and the sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusive Husband and why he was there and then the Father oh oh the Father... all superbly played. I also recognized myself and this movie was an eye-opener a relief a chance to face my OWN truth and finally doing something about it. I truly hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there.<br /><br />Since I didnt understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land -they werent fighting each other at all- I watched it a second time. Then I was able to see that if one hadnt lived a similar story one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all. That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance.<br /><br />But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!<br /><br />I dont give a rats ass (pardon my French) about to what extend the King Lear story is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: this movie has changed my life.<br /><br />Keep up the good work guys you CAN and DO make a difference.<br /><br />',pos
'this movie is ok if you like mindless action corny acting and a very small plot !The special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director ofEvent Horizon. The costumes are like something from a mad max movie .None of the soldiers talk so others tell them what to do.It eventually end up as a big shootem up movie with explosions all the place.

'WAIT until youve watched most of all other films ever released wait a year then watch this when youre ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybodys imagination.<br /><br />I agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data. Anything above 8 would be odd.<br /><br />Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured though she overdid the New Yorker accent but other times her southern (Virginia & NC) accent did sneak through. Ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film.<br /><br />The DVD I rented had two bonus features a mini-bio section that only featured Sandras bio - taken verbatim from IMDb. It also had a Trivia Quiz as a bonus - 3 questions. Hope you get them all right!',neg
'I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10.<br /><br />The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughs and gags are classic muppetism. I am glad these films are still around for the next generation. I hope I never out grow the magic of the muppets.',pos
'Im glad I never watched this show when it came out.<br /><br />I just wondered why it lasted 4 years. It reminds me of the terrible 80s with fake people fake clothes and fake music. How did I ever survive growing up in this era? <br /><br />The acting in the majority of episodes I have watched are forced. This makes for very boring shows. The plot lines are not very interesting as the old Twilight Zone shows. The old show inspired the imagination and made one look forward to the next show. <br /><br />Stick with the old Twilight Zone shows and spare yourself the pain of watching garbage.',neg
'A bigoted soldier kills a man for being Jewish and tries to pin it on a fellow soldier. Not as good as the novel it was based on (The Brick Foxhole) in which it was a gay man who was killed...but Hollywood wouldnt touch that in 1947. That said its still a very good film. The anti-Semitism is handled very well but its hammered into the audience that bigotry is bad...well duh! But this was 1947. The picture is well-acted by the entire cast (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the tone is very dark...as it should be. Very atmospheric too. A deserved big hit in its day...well worth seeing.',pos
'Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s EARLY VICTORIAN NOVELISTS where he looked at the works of Dickens Thackeray Eliot Trollope Mrs. Gaskell Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte. He selected these writers as the popular favorites of the first half of the Victorian period and he explained their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them) to the reading public. Some of his comments are quite relevant to this day but like all criticism it gives an idea of the spirit of the times of the critics life as well.<br /><br />Cecil thought highly of George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross) who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poetry). But for most modern readers they are usually acquainted with her shortest book SILAS MARNER which is still read in some high school curriculum. The other books FELIX HOLT THE RADICAL DANIEL DERONDA MIDDLEMARCH THE MILL ON THE FLOSS ADAM BEDE ROMOLA SCENES OF CLERICAL LIFE are still in print (Penguin for example has most of them in print) but are mostly unread. The one of most interest today is her last novel DERONDA where she discusses the Jews in English society and an incipient pre-Hertzl type of Zionism. ROMOLA is her sole attempt at a historic novel (about Savanarolas experiment of a religiously pure republic in Florence in the 1490s). Her meatiest novel is MIDDLEMARCH which is concerned with English society in the provinces in 1832 the year of the great Reform Bill of Lord Grey. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH in college for a literature course. It certainly is a thoughtful book (Virginia Woolf called it the most grown-up book in the English language). But it suffers (like all of Eliots novels) from one defect - she cannot write livable exciting prose. While Dickens is overly exuberant at times and Thackeray can become pompous and prolix and Trollope can become (as Lord Cecil says) very ordinary in his discussion and Charlotte Bronte can fail to explain certain relationships well and Mrs. Gaskell seems best dealing with female characters all of them (and Emily Bronte in her single novel) hold the readers interest. Reading most of Eliots novels is like trying to chisel sentences out of blocks of marble with a toothpick!<br /><br />To date I have read about fifty pages of MILL OF THE FLOSS. I notice that one of the other reviewers never finished the novel too. But I have read a synopsis of what it is about. The Tullivers (Maggie and her brother Tom) are the central figures - they own the mill in the title. Although close at the start of the story Maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in legal difficulties with Mr. Tulliver Sr. Tom takes a dim view of this relationship and the tragedy of the story is regarding the split between the siblings culminating in their demise at the conclusion (Maggie runs back to the mill to rescue Tom during a heavy flood and they die together). It must have been a success with Victorian readers but it is very gloomy and depressing to modern audiences.<br /><br />The movie changed the ending a little - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) does die at the end with her lover and Tom (James Mason) notes their deaths at the conclusion in his record book. The story is totally rewritten except for a double death in the flood at the conclusion. It doesnt really help matters. Although Fitzgerald and Mason do pretty well with their parts they cant really pull the film up by their work alone. The end result is a fairly minor film that fortunately did not hurt the leads careers. The only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by Frank Lawton who two years earlier played David Copperfield as a grown up opposite W.C.Fields Lionel Barrymore and Maureen OSullivan. But then Lawton never really had a major film career - he just happened to always be around in pictures some good some mediocre.',neg
'I am surprised that everyone (even the critics) seems to think this was a good movie. It was the most clichéd thriller ever made that I have seen. We have the bad guy who wants to force the good guy (or girls in this case) to do something or face the consequence. The good girl in this movie must use her smarts and skills to defeat the bad guy and save the day and her loved ones. Using charisma bravery and even luck to save the day. <br /><br />Where to begin? Well a young woman by the name of Lisa Reisert meets a young man by the name of Jackson Rippner (nice name) at an airport. One coincidence leads to another and soon it seems as if fate is bringing these two together. Sharing drinks sitting next to each other seemingly getting along in every way... Is there more to this strangeness? Could these two be meant for each other? Does fate have a reason for their strange and random encounter? <br /><br />Well as it turns out unfortunately yes. Jackson needs to Lisa to help him assassinate the Director of Homeland Security by moving him from one room to another so that his men can launch an attack on him. Oh if she doesnt do this then her father is dead. Though we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness Jackson more then explains how this is going to happen and why its in Lisas best interest to help him.<br /><br />Of course Lisa defeats his evil plans with her smarts and in the process stabs him in the neck makes him trip over chairs and hitting him with a field hockey stick. Oh and before that she leads him on wild chase through Miami airport where she gets passed post 9 11 security and steals a car that she later uses to run over the man who was ordered to kill her father. <br /><br />Yeah right.<br /><br />First of all I find it strange that a man like Jackson who can get his hands on high tech weaponry needs the help of a hotel manager. Couldnt he just sneak a bomb into the building? Wouldnt that make it safer for him and his team by leaving out any third parties? And why do characters like Jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they are threatening? Doesnt that make it easier to stop them by the same people? <br /><br />The actors did their best considering the movie they were given. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors to look out for. Also I believe that Jayma Mays (who played the loveable Cynthia) will be someone we will see more of. Its just too bad they all were stuck with this.<br /><br />2 out of 10',neg
'I am stunned at the negative comments that I have read and can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest. This is the most moving and real portrayal of Joseph Smith that I have ever seen. It was well acted to the point that at times I forgot that I was watching a movie. It brought Josephs life of hardship good-natured optimism enduring faith in people and God and ultimate sacrifice to life such in a way that frankly left me speechless and silent in awe. If anyone of ANY Christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive way--I would have to say it is a reflection of the individual and NOT the movie. I give the movie a 10 and encourage honest souls to view it. At the very LEAST it is an extremely heart felt portrayal of man who gave everything he had for what he believed...In a world where values and beliefs are ridiculed this movie stands as a enduring reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be- no matter what religious beliefs we hold.- Ann Pruitt-',pos
'I watched Sleeper Cell with a bit of trepidation worrying over whether the terrorists would be glorified. This mesmerizing series not only handled the subject matter responsibly it created depth and substance to almost every character. Oded Fehr just gobbles up the screen in every scene hes inand even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell he still has hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy held his own well though in some scenes I wondered why he wasnt shot on the spot because of the scowl he wore on his face.<br /><br />The pros of the series are the two leads Fehr and Ealy the well written characters--all of which were believable and tragic and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story. Having been married to a Muslim myself the atmosphere created was quite realistic. The cons for me personally were that the female T&A was overkillmost seemed gratuitous as well as some of the sex scenes. Despite that it is a raw gripping series that will make you think. Somebody give Fehr more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it. Hes got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating off him.',pos
'My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science-fiction film but upon turning it over my wife saw Rebecca St. James was in the film realized it was a Christian movie and suggested we watch it. We are conservative evangelicals but we also know that Christian films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. Nevertheless we decided to give it a screening.<br /><br />To be fair there were a few things I liked about the film. The musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good. The cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower-budget movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script. The film begins with an interesting premise - UFO abductions - but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movies two main characters... which then veers wildly into a treatise on the Rapture. At least the Frank Peretti-inspired The Visitation (which was itself a deeply flawed film) had an endgame that tied together the movies premise. Unidentified ends nowhere even close to where it started which is a huge letdown.<br /><br />As for the acting? The supporting acting ranges from decent to awful. (Rebecca St. James plays a bit part and is passable.) For their part a few of the main characters are manned capably enough. Sadly their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable. The protagonists are anything but; you know its bad when two Christian viewers find the most vocal Christian character in the film to be the most annoying.<br /><br />A final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie which will be of more interest to Christian than non-Christian readers. In a word it is embarrassing. Other Christian films like Carmens The Champion and Perettis The Hangmans Curse have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the Christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive. This film by contrast is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy-handed and lacking in tact that a non-Christian would have a hard time taking it seriously.<br /><br />I do believe that the filmmakers heart is in the right place and I applaud efforts to create good Christian film. Unfortunately this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a screening of a good Christian film consider Mercy Streets the aforementioned The Champion or (if youre Pentecostal) Robert Duvalls provocative The Apostle. <br /><br />As for Unidentified? Rent it if you must but screen it before you show it to a non-Christian or a larger audience.',neg
'Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and handsome drifter who arrives in a road bar. He meets the young beautiful and unsatisfied wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa) owners of the bar. He trades his mechanical skills by some food and lodging and has an affair with Giovanna. They both decide to kill Giuseppe forging a car accident. The relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. The noir and neo-realistic movie of Luchino Visconti is outstanding. This is the first time that I watch this version of `The Postman Always Rings Twice. I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner and the 1981 version where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the cinema but this one is certainly the best. My vote is ten.',pos
'Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaption yet. Not surprising since King himself wrote the screenplay. The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine house. One of the other residents is Jud a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area. One is the highway that runs right through their frontyard. The other is a path leading to the Pet Sematary where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway. Soon enough Ellie Creeds cat Church is found dead. Luckily this happens while the family with the exception of Louis(the father) is away for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another burial ground beyond the Pet Sematary where Church is to be buried. Later Louis is greeted(not so politely) by Church. Hes returned appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing more I can say without ruining the story.<br /><br />Of all the King adaptions Ive seen this would be the most terrifying. The characters are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a great job directing the proceedings. Suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film due in part to the plot development. The scene where Gage is killed will stick in your mind forever. Then of course we have the conclusion. Easy to determine whats going to happen but Lambert pulls off some genuinely scary and sometimes disturbing moments.<br /><br />Overall this is a good film and an excellent adaption. If you enjoy being scared and dont mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then Pet Sematary is just what youre looking for. Non Horror fans will want to avoid this.',pos
'A brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time and certainly far ahead of anything that was being released in mass production at the same point in history. The influence of this work upon Tim Burtons Nightmare Before Christmas is readily apparent. One can only imagine how Starewicz slaved over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece.<br /><br />There have been very few animated films of this caliber. Its a shame that more people havent seen this gem.<br /><br />Apparently IMdB now requires comments to be at least ten lines long so this is the tenth line. This must be something new - but I really dont have anything else to say!',pos
'Just got around to seeing Monster Man yesterday. It had been a long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up Im glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level. True you really cant expect too much from hearing the plot rundown but after reading some of the reviews for it I was ecstatic. I mean what trash fan wouldnt want to see a gore flick about a deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his make-shift monster truck? I went in expecting a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got so much more. This was a horror comedy that actually worked. The film makers got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time. Kudos to Michael Davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the sickass humor. Let me list just a few reasons why I love this movie so much: First off is the story. Its been done to death in so many other flicks. A college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married. He being the 25 year old virgin that he is hops in his Vista Cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good jive. Hidden in the backseat of his station wagon is good buddy Harley. Harley is the loudmouth former friend who laughs and talks just like Jack Black in High Fidelity. You cant help but like the guy but if he was your friend in real life youd have to keep a whiffle ball bat handy(laugh all you want but have you ever been hit with one?) to keep him in check. So hes a little on the obnoxious side to say the least but you can tell that hes a loyal friend deep down...Anyway theyre on the road and when they stop in a bar they aggravate the locals. Now theyre being stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck. Thats it. Yeah along the way they pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker but Im too lazy and hungover to go into that right now... so just watch the damn movie.<br /><br />Second thing I love was the humor. This one had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since Cabin Fever. Just how messed up is it? Well I wont even go into the whole cat scene and as for the corpse burrito thing Ill leave that to your virgin eyes as well. The bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like John Turturro bothered me too. Harley although a totally obnoxious frat-boy type can really sling off the one liners. Love the clogs by the way. I need a new pair..<br /><br />The GORE. This one pours it on heavy. While the first hour plays out as a demented road comedy the last third is all about blood and guts. If the movie hadnt kept such a light tone throughout it would have been a little disturbing but seeing how it was all played for laughs there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it. If youre still in your seat by the time it comes youll probably see the humor in it too but seriously there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff. There was a big plot turn that I DIDNT see coming and when the credits rolled I was completely satisfied. I had gotten exactly what I came for and Im really glad that I bought it. Much like Cabin Fever its going to get a lot of replay.<br /><br />The Look of the movie was outstanding. There was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late 80s and I loved the exaggerated colors. Its obvious that Monster Man was done on a relatively low budget but much like Cabin Fever (sorry I keep comparing the two) it actually works in the movies favor. Cabin Fever was an ode to the 70s greats this was the 80s answer to that. So take that for what its worth. No CGI here. This is what we all needed. Im not exactly sure why it didnt get a theatrical release because this is everything that Jeepers Creepers SHOULD have been. Thank god for Lions Gate.',pos
'This movie is among my favorite foreign films some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson. <br /><br />In Japan a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. In the instant that it takes his train to pass he is enthralled by her. But is it only by her beauty by her faraway glance or a connection that they will both discover that they share? <br /><br />Shall We Dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. Breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of Japanese society they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away. It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and in itself transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be.',pos
'I dont know what Dick steel was talking about but I found this film to be one of Japans most thrilling epics to date. As for Armageddon or Deep Impact or for that matter The day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. For what I know of films most of the catastrophes in films are basically run of the mill asteroid flicks or one of which of Global Warming. This how ever ran a different course. A course of natural means where the earths crust is beginning to erode to such a degree that it will take another piece of land with it for the ride. What the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the erosion from going to far and Sinking Japan altogether. In most cases this would simply be called tectonic shifting on steroids. I found the characters rather appealing in every way from the child who lost her mother only to face her own demise among unfamiliar friends. Or the rescue girl who does all the she can to save lives in the face of disaster. Or a man who thought he could change her mind not to be such a dare devil and go with him to safety only to become the hero himself and save his homeland. And lets not forget how the rest of the world just shucked them all back only to be forgotten by having the world turning their backs on the Japanese citizens who cried for help. This was a great movie in all aspects. What Dick is trying to say is that this movie was not Hollywood made that it was made in Japan that it had characters which rival other actors around the world that the effects are very gorgeous as he mentioned but its all he was waiting for and nothing else. He lacks the vision of whats important to everyone and why this film had every element of feeling of grandeur and of humanity. I thought this film was top rate and I have seen many disaster films to know that Japan Sinks was possibly one of the most original and well thought out projects I have witnessed. I really hope Shinji Higuchi will make another of such films. Oh and by the way I am not Japanese though in many ways I wish I was. I am Canadian born and raised. And an avid movie buff in all aspects. Predjudicial visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion. Dick you should watch it with a more open heart and mind dont just look for the eye candy which makes a films content look for whats more important and understand it. They may not be American but the Japanese have cornered the market lately for some of the most breath taking and down right gritty film making to date. Which is why spending 25000000 is just what the Doctor ordered. You heard right 25000000 to make this film. Now you tell me was it worth it? or was it worth it because American actors werent in it?',pos
'I got this DVD well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday. I dont know why it took me so long as I do like the Inspector Gadget show and even the new Gadget and the Gadgetinis. While it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie there are some old things missing that bog this Gadget right down the toilet.<br /><br />First of all the classic Inspector Gadget theme song and music is completely absent. The composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but its still just no good enough. The Gadget-mobile is now a talking car not a car that can turn into a van. Plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain hardly make an appearance at all.<br /><br />The plot is non-existent. Theres something about a transformation formula and Doctor Claw using for some never revealed evil but thats all I got. What the deal was with the short/giant Italian guy I will never know. It had nothing to do with anything.<br /><br />And if the title is anything to go by his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever. And he stays on the force so why its called last case is a mystery also.<br /><br />I wasnt impressed at all. This is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on DVD but dont let that prompt you into buying whatever Inspector Gadget DVDs you can. I sold this mere seconds after finally watching it. No kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it.',neg

Over dinner that night with Michael Gaffikin Fiona realises that the dead woman might be Sheila Anderson a woman from the mainland who lives on the island through the winter months. A quick search at her home Dove Cottage reveals the missing remains of her body her home proving to be the murder scene but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods? Suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island one Colonel Howard (Jonathan Newth)who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together.<br /><br />Goudry asks Gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind. A sheep is found mutilated and then a Canadian ornithologist is found slain. With a heavy fog rolling in the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help the radio also doesnt work seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut. Reports of UFOs and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach. Inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off Gaffikins idea that aliens might be involved but a rise in radioactive levels on the island has him doubting himself.<br /><br />The Nightmare Man is based on the novel Child of the Vodyanoi by David Wiltshire it is here adapted by Dr Who and Blakes 7 scriptwriter Robert Holmes and directed by Douglas Camfield who also had directing experience on both Sci/Fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board. The Nightmare Man though is on the whole a succinctly better crafted piece that builds its plot alongside solid character development even down to the minor characters time is given to giving them all a firm background. The island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that has been used over and over but its one that I enjoy very much the remoteness the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts. In many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama but credit to Camfield he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times. There is an authenticity about proceedings the characters even speaking Gaelic at times to further this point. If there is one negative about the killer its that we are given his/her/its POV for the killings an acceptable cliché on its own but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little. Still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer given the clues presented but its a fun and very well acted piece. The local Scottish cast are exceptional the local bobbies Roeves and Cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold. Imrie never one ive taken to in other works is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a Hammer production. The outlandish maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers it disappointed me in some ways but taking into account when it was made its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it is even more terrifying.',pos
'I have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time. The movie was boring long long and awful plot. The special effects sucks like hell - Its like watching a movie back in 1999. Its a total waste of an hour and a half of my time. Matthew Settles performance was quite bad. I saw him in Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs he wasnt THAT bad. In fact not bad at all. But in this film his acting wasnt convincing enough it was quite bad and there wasnt any chemistry between the rest of the crew either. Plus his eyes seems empty like hes not feeling it. It surprised me really because he was good in Band of Brothers.<br /><br />Anyway dont even bother to watch this movie. Its a big big BIG waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two get something else to do besides watching this movie. Trust me youll regret it!',neg
'This film was the one of the first of the 70s women-in-prison film genre. This movie was incredibly violent with lots of sadistic torture being inflicted on the inmates. The film takes place in the Phillipines which looks like a horribly ugly country. No doubt the producers used this factor to their advantage to emphasize the gruesome situation that the prisoners were in.<br /><br />Blaxploitation movie queen Pam Grier has the starring role in this movie. She plays Blossom a renegade who gets thrown in the vile womens prison on trumped-up charges. Her boyfriend played by Sid Haig tries to rescue Blossom. He and Blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction and Blossoms incarceration was orchestrated by the corrupt Phillipino government.<br /><br />Pam Grier and Sid Haig stand-out amongst the otherwise lackluster cast. The film itself put way too much emphasis on violence perpetrated against the prisoners. Their captors just used them solely as objects of their sadism. This got boring real fast. This movie couldve used more interesting plot-lines and subtlety. This is not one of Roger Cormans better pictures. The many women-in-prison films that followed this one were much better all around. Id recommend The Big Bird Cage only to Pam Grier fans.',neg
'I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.<br /><br />The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange. Definitely see this movie on the big screen and dont wait for it to come out on tape. It wont be half as good on tape.<br /><br />This movie is not for the easily freaked out. It will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget. But for those who like to be freaked out.....ENJOY!',pos

Also lets not forget the appearance of Saul Williams in the movie who i am a big fan of.<br /><br />After watching it i recommended the movie to lots of my friends and everyone was pretty much blown away.<br /><br />But still it is very underrated maybe because of the lack of action and explosions. Im sorry this is not a movie about blowing things up its about how humans behave and how people live in worlds that dont exist.<br /><br />Go on and enjoy.',pos
'What is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band. This disc is NOT for the faint of heart...the music is incredibly intense and VERY cool. What you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the Who was so huge for so long. It is true that their records were great but their shows were the top of the heap. In 1969 when this concert was shot the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the Beatles were gone and bands (and audiences) had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity--something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by Britney and Christina. What you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert out it really is amazing.',pos
'Tobe Hooper (fresh off mainstream success with Poltergeist) aims for the skies this time around. Lifeforce is an adaptation of Colin Wilsons The Space Vampires. The script by Aliens Dan O Bannon and Don Jakoby) varies a bit I was told: the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and Haileys Comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by Earth a few weeks after the films release (so Ive read).<br /><br />The story concerns a shuttle mission (commander by Steve Railsback) sent to investigate Haileys Comet as it passes by Earth. All goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated bat-like creatures. Looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids (two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too) in odd stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow.<br /><br />A bit later the ship returns to Earth but no contact can be made by NASA and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. Upon docking with the Churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However it is learned that an escape pod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown.<br /><br />Soon they make the discovery of the aliens origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. If you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you dont feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough of the populations essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well.<br /><br />Thankfully the Commander survives re-entry in the pod (crash lands in Texas no less) and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed London dry of their souls.<br /><br />Tobe Hooper (of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)) does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date. The production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. Production Designer John Graysmark (fresh off The Bounty (1984)) uses every bit of four stages at Elsree Studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint on Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (1983) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original Star Wars (1977) manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck even maestro Henry Mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. In the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May (vampire queen). Railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like nobodys business. That comes in hand as his mind deteriorates when the queens grip tightens on his soul. Gorgeous French actress May doesnt have a heck of a lot of lines (were there more than ten?) but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the jingle bells to pull it of. Pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. Job accomplished and where do I sign up to be victim? I really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clichés and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is accounted for here: bats (their true form resembles a large bat) coffins {the stasis fields resemble these) transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything) massive sexual appeal (Miss May.duh) not to mention they even include the old standby stake-through-the-heart (this time a bit of a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart). The only thing they didnt touch on was religion but I think that the vampires using the cathedral at the end as home base might just be a bit of a wink and a nod.<br /><br />In short (yeah right 800 words later) Lifeforce is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different wrinkles. The effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged (at least at the time) and horror and sci-fi fans engaged. 4 of 5.',pos
'Not only the title the film itself is a long one too or so it seems. Thats because of the outdated style of acting and the pathetic way its hackneyed themes are visualised. Bad marriages of the sisters and a homo-brother who dares not speak the name of his sexual preference - Italy 2003 you dont believe it (and you dont have to).',neg

'Oh yes I have to agree with the others who describe this as appalling. The acting in this four hour feature is uniformly bad so bad to the point that I find it impossible to believe any of the actors in this production could possibly earn a living as an actor. I still wonder who did the casting. Each delivers their lines without appearing to have any kind of engagement or emotional investment with any other character. None appear to have a true relationship family or otherwise with another. The direction is also appalling and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing. Were the film editors asleep?<br /><br />The costumes appear authentic to the Regency period but the fabrics look 20th century and colors (especially the blue colors!) are jarring and I dont believe were available in early 19th century fabric except perhaps in silk. <br /><br />Also the hair: the men have obvious 1970s haircuts and the women have big hair---especially the woman playing Anne Elliot.<br /><br />All the female characters young and old are quite lovely but this doesnt make up for the lack of acting abilities. The actress playing Anne looks as though she is in her forties while Anne Elliot is supposed to be 27 years old. I mean where was the makeup and lighting crew if we were to find the woman playing Anne believable? She spends much of her time gazing pensively with her eyes at the level of the horizon whether indoors or out. I wonder still what that was suppose to convey. Regret perhaps? Yes this production is regrettable!<br /><br />The actress playing Louisa was truly appalling. She screams squeals giggles and leaps around like an ill mannered twelve-year-old (my apologies to anyone twelve years of age reading this) that I found myself eagerly awaiting the moment when she knocks herself out. How this behavior is suppose to attract an adult male is beyond me. Most would back off when she first opened her mouth to giggle and shriek.<br /><br />The actor playing Captain Wentworth portrays someone so bland and colorless one wonders why any woman could pine over him for eight years.<br /><br />The rejoining of the pair at the end is not convincingly done or explained. How did they get together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; that is certain. No there has to be more than that and it is not explained in the film. <br /><br />I rate this production two stars: one because it is Austens work and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were lovely. The only reason I could watch the entire production is that I was off sick with the flu and I got it from the library. <br /><br />If you enjoyed the book see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this film even if you havet read the book.',neg
'A tough sell: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud bellowing film about WWII Shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged blustery brilliant-but-unreliable star at the end of his tether. The actors effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of King Lear (during an Air Raid!) yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation. Based on the waning years of actor Donald Wolfit whose dresser was Ronald Harwood this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery-chewing thespians. Unfortunately Albert Finney (at this point in his career not at all elderly) seems too robust and quick-thinking to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) cannot modulate Sirs moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us so that in one scene hes stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice and in the next hes curiously falling apart. With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss (and his future) yet servant Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and goads Finney to carry on rather than rest. Courtenay who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney for Best Actor) is far more attuned to his role and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film. These two thankfully do not peck at each others heads and scenarist Harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern (which could possibly be perceived in the films first act); but without a juxtaposition of servant vs. celebrity theres nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism the hint at what once was. *1/2 from ****',neg
'Let me start out by saying that I used to really like Betty Grable particularly from Down Argentine Way but by the time she got around to this disaster she had also got round and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been fairly desperate) the story was bad the colours good and the film far too long. It had some of the old standbys in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success. The music score was woeful and I have to say not one tune was memorable in any way....as I was such a fan of Miss Grable I always wish I had never seen this one!',neg

And While You Were Sleeping. The rest of the cast is fun.

'I never saw any of John Leguizamos stand-up before I watched Freak and after seeing it again on HBO comedy recently it was better more enlivening and with things that at the age of 14 I couldnt understand quite before. Spike Lee did a wonderful job directing keeping the visual angle up to par with Leguizamos theatrics and the style of personal storytelling; its substance and style merging together but unobtrusively. We get Leguizamos rants about race and sex (the bits about sex are classic) but a lot of it is about family and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father. Even when things get dark in some of the stories theres something fresh or crazy or random that Leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh and it works more often than not. If something does fall flat (for me at any rate) it might be his personality tics here and there. But overall its the kind of fun material that isnt heady but is so true to itself that it stings.

'Ever since I can remember and Im only 18 my mother and I have been and continue to watch older movies because well I find them much more rewarding in the long run (but hey dont get me wrong I do love the movies we have today just not as much as I love movies of the 40s and 50s) Anyways now I have to say the moment I started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the TV. Of course my favorite character was the Grandmother played by Lucile Watson. But I loved the way Betty Davis and her family was portrayed. The children...did not act like children in the slightest. But there is good reason for that having had to hid and run most of your life seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence. So people saying oooo i hated how the kids acted...blah blah blah read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see.<br /><br />Paul Lukas...dear Paul did an amazing job!!! Now I know many people are mad that he go the Oscar and Bogie didnt but hey they both did amazing jobs so I think it could have gone either way. But Lukas performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie I was reduced to tears. I loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone!! :-D',pos
'The main word that comes to mind when considering this film is dodgy. This is a low-quality film biography of one of the most iconic performers of all time. The Gloved One deserved better.<br /><br />Before getting into the meat of my thoughts on this biopic I have to say that there are two things I found effective. First was the use of actual fan footage and interviews at certain points in the film especially in the scenes depicting the first set of child molestation allegations. I feel that this contributed a certain authenticity that was *severely* lacking throughout the rest of the film. Second was the sequence depicting the courtship of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I will not comment on whether I believe the marriage was a sham but by many accounts it was a relationship where care and affection existed between the two parties involved. That really came across in this film; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had decent enough chemistry to pull it off. These successful points are enough to keep Man in the Mirror away from 1-star status.<br /><br />That said...there was very little else here that worked. Very few of the actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray most egregiously those playing Elizabeth Taylor Janet Jackson and Diana Ross. Also the absence of Jacksons music was a huge loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without his music?? I understand that they were unable to secure the rights to it with this being a low-budget unauthorized production; it seems though that if you cant have the mans music in a film about him you might as well pack it up and go home because youre missing out on an extremely important part of his life story.<br /><br />This films characterization of Jackson bothered me a little too. I wont argue that he was troubled and may have been a few fries short of a value meal but here he was portrayed as something close to mentally disabled. I dont believe that Jackson known to have been a shrewd businessman would have been quite as naive about how the adult world works as he was made out to be in this film.<br /><br />Finally the way this film was written was nothing short of disgraceful. Many lines or exchanges of dialogue were either extremely corny like Michael and Janets Tinkerbell exchange or nonsensical like the Blanket of love comments made by Michael. Also the screenwriters dont exactly have a knack for subtlety. There was a lot of telegraphing of upcoming events (What could possibly go wrong?? sorts of lines) and extremely overt hammering of themes and motifs in the film (if Id heard the word believe one more time...). This is what ultimately hobbled the film as something that could be considered awesomely bad.<br /><br />Perhaps when we are a few years or even a decade or three removed from Jacksons death someone will be able to bring his story to life in a more deserving film. By that time we might have a better perspective on his life and someone will be able to present a truly thoughtful examination of who Michael Jackson really was and what hes meant to the world of entertainment. This very dodgy biopic was not that film.',neg
'This is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that should not be missed by any fan of French New Wave or Underground film. There are barely opening or closing credits--we are just dropped into the world of consumerist art revolution and youth. This film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality. Lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with films discussing documentary but this time we do it for the sake of consuming and marketing not for describing the real.',pos
'I am 17 and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade Scooby Doo and the Goblin King which I wasnt expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes expecting something very good but from what I saw of it I wasnt impressed at all. First of all I hated the animation. It was flat deflated and very Saturday- morning -cartoon -standard easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hate had slightly better animation. Even worse Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens and I really missed Fred Velma and Daphne as they added a lot to the old episodes when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also hated the character changes because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero something they wouldve never had done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune wasnt very good either I cant even remember it and the jokes were lame and contrived. Though I do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast had they had better material and hadnt been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible which they did might I add. In conclusion I personally thought it was awful and I am not trying to discredit it its what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox',neg
'Saying a film is depressing isnt necessarily a bad thing. Im very willing to watch a depressing film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one. Its the often heartbreaking story of a Chinese man and his family as they experience many years of both hardship and plenty. BUT I must warn you that this might just be about the most depressing film to come out of Hollywood in the 1930s--because peasant life in China was TOUGH to say the least. Be prepared to watch segments about famine death and disease.<br /><br />About the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by Paul Muni. While he was an exceptionally talented man its just a real shame that Hollywood always cast people of European descent to play Asian leads during this era. If you are paying attention at all its pretty obvious that Muni is wrong for the part.',pos
'I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show. I still vividly remember the film especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid almost dull leading man type and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. This film however proved what an interesting actor he could be. He did not get enough roles like this during his long career. This is his best performance. He is totally believable in a truly villainous role. From what I have read he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolans character was. Nolan was a great actor but this character really aggravated me. The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years. This film is definitely worth a look.',pos
'I admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film I wasnt entirely sure I was going to sit through the whole thing. Like many other people I found it pretty boring and I wasnt entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together. However if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is. I really think its sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists. <br /><br />Rivers and Tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of Andy Goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy. It is slow moving and unglamorous but I think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that Goldsworthys art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated. Ive even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which I just think is madness.<br /><br />On the other hand lots of people complain about CDs coming with the lyrics written out inside them. A lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics I guess Im just the kind of person that believes that Id like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork. I can still take it how I want to even if I know what it was meant to do. I can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie. He does after all lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you dont want Goldsworthy talk about his art while youre watching the film feel free to turn the sound off. Thats like not reading the lyrics if you dont want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourself.<br /><br />I think that Andy Goldsworthys work which I had no idea existed before I watched this movie is incredibly impressive and Im glad that this film was made in order to showcase it. Indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and I really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used. Whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented Goldsworthys work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is not the star Goldsworthys art is. And given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slow-moving nature of the film it seems to me that director Thomas Riedelsheimer knows that.',pos

'If this series supposed to be an improvement over Batman - The Animated Series I for one think it failed terribly. The character drawing is lousy... (Catwoman for instance looks awful...) But what really annoyed me is that it made Batman look like a sort of wimp who just cant take care of himself in a battle without the help of two even three sidekicks. I mean hes Batman for Gods sake! I know the comic books I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batmans allies besides Robin but still... making Batman say that he needs help from them... What he cant handle a few punches? In BTAS he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem... Hes getting old? Come on...<br /><br />And another thing: I really dont think that Batman would allow a kid like Tim Drake to go into battle that soon without years of hard training. One its irresponsible (and Batman is everything but irresponsible) and two its not what happened in the comics if we are to remain faithful to them.<br /><br />Batman - The Animated Series made history with its animation its stories and its characters... That really was a legend of Batman. The New Adventures series turned the legend into just another Batman flick.',neg
'Considered by many to be a strangely overlooked Chabrol it seems to me the reason it has been cold shouldered is its sleaze factor. Not as overtly sexy violent or gory as many films of this period it nevertheless starts rather startlingly and although becoming more measured continues to ooze a rather unpleasant odour. Ms Audran not here the ice maiden but a drunken mother Donald Pleasence does a cameo as a child molester David Hemmings has his eyes on underage sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother sister and niece. No not very nice at all and Chabrol treats it all as if it is very normal (like it might be in some small French village!) instead of Ed McBains New York City. Had this been treated in a more sensational manner then it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film. Here we really have to choose between the likelihood of various unpleasant options before the final denouement. Very watchable',pos
'I rented this some years ago the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video was hitting its strides (you know where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films).I didnt know what to expect other than what was printed. First thing I thought while watching was what the hells wrong with the sound?-Obviously there was no dialogue dubbing. Words echoed so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention-mind you theres no Shakespeare here!just simple talk. The story is simple enough boy meets girl etc.. What struck me as humorous and heartfelt was the people in the movie didnt seem like caricatures written into the storybut rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs(uniforms included). All the while you begin to sense what the filmmaker is afterthen see that there are no attempts at cheap humor(people hurting their privatesusing vulgarities this couldnt have hurt the marketing. There was something honest about it. I thought if theyd have a bigger budget then it would have been better which im sure they considered dailybut they went ahead and made it.

'I just saw this movie for the second time with my 8-year-old daughter and I remembered why we liked it the first time. All these people who say it is bad are too uptight and critical! It is simply an entertaining little movie its not supposed to change the world. I thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. (Except for Jeremy Jordan as Guy--he was a maggot who looked seriously in need of soap and shampoo. If HE is supposed to be the hot guy in their school then theyve got slim pickins.) But I digress--Drew Barrymore was delightful as usual and David Arquette was even enjoyable and I usually cant stomach him if only because of those STUPID AT&T commercials! Molly Shannon is always entertaining and Leelee Sobieski did a great job as a tortured brain. Some parts were actually painful to watch reminding me of high school. Even though I thankfully didnt get made fun of it made my heart ache for those who do. Movies like this are actually good for children to see--my daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some of the students and how wrong it was. This movie is appropriate for anyone and a good way to while away 2 hours. If theres ever a time you want to see a lighthearted little movie with a happy ending where you dont have to think very much then this is definitely a consideration.',pos
'Imagine a GILLIGANS ISLAND set in the African desert in modern times. Add people nowhere near as jaunty as the Skipper or Marianne--and enough angst to fill a German psychiatrists office. Throw in a plot that manages to be interesting only episodically and literary parallelism that never delves deeply enough to truly satisfy. Season with a truly morose topic thats been exploited since the first world travelers found themselves very very lost.<br /><br />If THE KING IS ALIVE werent a product of the reigning czars du jour of Dogme 95 would this film be garnering as much attention? Dogme 95 is to Hollywood as Danish modern is to rococo. A byproduct of digital technology this Scandinavian movement seeks--quite dogmatically--to strip away artificiality in film-making by using more natural elements and returning to the essence of storytelling. PEARL HARBOR for instance is the Dogme Antichrist.<br /><br />Director/co-author Kristian Levrings saga ponders interpersonal relations and human nature when placed under the fire of a life-threatening situation. Eleven people aboard a bus riding through the Namibian sand dunes suddenly find themselves stranded in the remains of an abandoned town. An African local who does not speak their language serves as observer and narrator (whose insights are among the films most trenchant). As the strongest heads off for a five-day walk to the nearest village the others stay behind surviving on dented-canned carrots and circumambulating their likely future as vulture chow. Former thespian Henry decides that this rather unappealing crew needs a diversion and hand-writes KING LEAR from memory. He assigns roles and the group passes many days learning lines and rehearsing in an effort to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable.<br /><br />Gradually the cast begins to lose it and the savageries of their natureor William Golding might say human naturebegin to surface. If youve ever seen LORD OF THE FLIES you know that these things can get ugly that being in a lifeboat situation can turn even Mother Teresa into the PMSing termagant of Calcutta.<br /><br />The film was shot using an international ensemble of American English French and South African actors who the Dogme dogma dictates develop themselves and their roles quite organically. THE KING was also filmed chronologically adding a sense of realism to the ever-increasing desperation of its characters. After up to three hand-held cameras shot in digital results were transferred to 35mm film.<br /><br />The performance that compels most comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays a boho Pop Tart trying to bolster the spirits of the group in any and every way she can. Henry (David Bradley) is another finely played character whose passion for his lifes work ultimately saves the gang from utter despair. Its hard to feel too sorry for the otherscruel wives and their oafish husbands hirsute old womanizers sulky French intellectuals wealthy men who have more important places to be than marooned in the Namibian desert. Beckett might hate this question but why is this group riding a bus together through remote Africa in the first place? Life-threatening morbidity! Utter despair rendered in graphic detail! A relentlessly tedious pace! Enjoy.',neg
'Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree films dont have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters. Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynchs opus I have to say I couldnt give a turd about Mr Green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world. <br /><br />Also while so many people seem to try and say you didnt enjoy because you didnt get it I would have to disagree - I didnt enjoy because I was bored. I wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help. Call it clever if you will - I think its repetitious.<br /><br />However my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw. Just music over black. Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GRs pretentiousness? Or did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed???',neg
'Thats what I found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film. First off the computer effects are absolutely mind-blowing! Those computer wizs really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie though...<br /><br />None of the characters act in a realistic manner especially in the aforementioned despicable 3rd act (I promise I wont give it away but trust me its not worth keeping a secret!). A lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally like when they try to explain that an invisible mans eyelids dont work. Please give the viewers more credit than that!!!<br /><br />Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do after all if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man from 1933. There is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous and is not mentioned once later on. If more attention had been paid it Kevin bacons mad scientist might have made a little more sense. <br /><br />The movie would actually be much more successful as a porno since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner. But this piece of work... go see something else. Or dont and live with the consequences!<br /><br />3/10',neg
'Dô desu ka den is the first colored movie of Master Akira Kurosawa and surprisingly is not about samurais ronins warlords or battlefields. It is inside a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo where the dwellers are homeless drunkards beggars tramps abused women losers. I do not know the reason why Kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors but indeed they are very sad stories some of them heart-breaking. I personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them; the story of the retarded boy that believes he pilots a train; the story of the man that raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather.

'We actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe wed missed something... nope whats missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction. I actually went back to Robbins novel to see if I could find the problem and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy-headed junk.<br /><br />So the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots. All of the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively mortified - except for Rain Phoenix who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is. The dialog is one long unwavering cringe. Scenes dont make sense from second to second and the connections between them are nonexistent. And yet the movie stumbles blindly on convinced that it is saying something profound.<br /><br />This is too bad to even be funny; it is simply excruciating. Gus Van Zant has done other good-to-great movies which I encourage you to see and Im happy he survived (and appears to have learned from) this mess.',neg
'This film is an eery but interesting film. I will tell you why it is eery later in this review.<br /><br />The film is interesting because it was the first film to ever contain sound. No it may not be a one hour and forty two minute film no it may not contain great action scenes but it is still a wonderful film to me. It sparked a whole knew revolution if you will of sound movies. This can be a little eery to watch knowing that everyone in that film are now dead I can hear the voice of a man in the beginning who no longer walks the Earth visible and that the sound is cracky and broken.<br /><br />I recommend this video for everyone to watch. This created movies as we know it today!',pos
'First lesson that some film makers (particularly those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - just style does not sell. I guess Tashan when translated will mean style. Second if you are hell bent on selling style that does not spare you from having a decent story.<br /><br />Tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director. But it is not slick. For example all three - Saif Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at different points in the story. But this setup is not utilized to properly. There could have been a better mix and match of their narrations. Actions sequences are from the seventies.<br /><br />Cheoreography of the film is awful. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just sleep walked through this film. Vishal-Shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film. Why is there a sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not on Anil Kapoor when he is the one who is English crazy? <br /><br />Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the film. But he is in his stereotyped self. You wont mind missing this film.',neg
'OK this is one strange film! Fans of Ed Wood Jr. will appreciate the inventive techniques director George Barry utilizes like stock footage and cheesy voice overs. He can make a crack in the wall into a plot device! There is more humor than horror here but I found it an uneven blend. You will be laughing and crying and probably wondering why you got your hands on this. Barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972 and was completed in 1977 at a cost of $10000. Thats 59 months and $9900 too much! If you like your cheese on the campy side with vintage 70s gore you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack.',neg
'As far as I am concerned this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs I am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is Paris France; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog.<br /><br />Both make this movie a bit unique at least to English-speaking film noir fans. Actually an American Jules Dussain shot the film so its not entirely a European film. Initially I was disappointed in this after I had watched the first 40 minutes. Its an expensive DVD and I was bored. However once that silent segment started - the actual heist (you already know whats it about) the film picked up considerably and just got better and better.<br /><br />In fact I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist. The best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography. This is what makes the disc worth owning. Its excellent film noir photography and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen Paris...and this is Paris in the mid 1950s. There are lots of bleak-but-interesting rain-soaked Paris streets and buildings I found fascinating to view. In fact there were many more of those great shots than of London in the much better known film The Third Man.<br /><br />The lead actor in here Jean Servais I think his name is also is interesting to view. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton and that sums it up perfectly. A warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film. This is France not the United States so there is a little bit of both in here. I appreciate the DVD offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version too.',pos
'I have to say this is one of the worst films Ive ever seen. They had a pretty good storyline to go on but than the messed it up so badly. First of all the cast is all wrong where did that van peeble(crap actor btw) and puff daddy come from??? It looks like Carlito has come from the hood and used to hang about with some real idiots. This film doesnt do Carlitos Way any justice. Im so happy that the sequel Carlitos Way came out first if I had seen this rubbish first I would have never given the pacino version a chance. And anyway pacino is supposed to have read this story thought its crap and did the sequel instead. Carlitos Way: Rise to Power - 1 out of 10. Carlitos Way - 9 out of 10.',neg
'Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable the characters are stereotypes the editing too exaggerated. Anyway the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions. <br /><br />Instead I think this is a straight commercial thing. Including a character from the french part of Switzerland (the actor IS the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the bands called SENS UNIK) seems to aim to a larger audience. A straight German-swiss movie would not have sold in the french part - and vice versa. What really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie. Sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips! <br /><br />I also think the topic of young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives is a wide spread reality in Zurich. Therefore it should be elaborated with more care. I hope Samir got enough money with Snow White in order that his next movie is gonna show his true artistic skills.',neg

'Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It is so cheesily filmed the focus is not even on this supposed real half-caste it is more on the crew coming from Hollywood to make the movie. No cinematic significance whatsoever and if I could take back the almost 1 1/2 hours that I spent watching this film I would feel much better.<br /><br />At first it starts out giving you the impression it will be filmed somewhat generically like an actual Hollywood production. However then they go into the narration of the story and its filmed so f***ing terribly. Its supposed to be a take on Blair Witch Project really since they pretty much use what you would think is real camera footage its not dont be fooled.<br /><br />Worst movie I have ever seen . . . on the positive side it has like one semi-scary scene in it and the visuals of the half-caste werent too bad looking at all.

'Terrible. Theres no way to get around it. A script at the level of one from some Mexican soap opera a choice and use of the places of shooting that make the movie labyrinthine and at the same time repetitive and monotonous with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast. The references to Tarantinos work so poorly made are more an insult than anything else.

'Yes i really found this film distasteful. <br /><br />I didnt like the Sandra Oh character she really annoyed me. It is unlikely she would be accepted into rural Italian life due to the fact she is non-white. this was a bit of PC nonsense. <br /><br />the film is also offensive to Italian men. For instance the one man she (Diane Lane) has an affair is turns out to be a caddish cheat. But guess what: at the end your typically plasticky American brick-head turns up all cheesy white smile and tan and she finally finds what she wants all along: a real American man and now she has colonized another part of the world. <br /><br />In fact this film is quite racist in its depiction of Italians and the way it subjugates them as either smarmy lotharios or backward peasants. <br /><br />the photography was good but the film and its attitude were trash.',neg
'This is a great movie a must own. I really liked every aspect of it from the sword fighting the romance the costumes were really well done and put together. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. I also loved the mystery and magic. Also the message of the power of love that love is the greatest power there is. I really like the heart of the king in the sense that he desires peace instead of the bloodshed and hate. I wish that I could live in a world like that with flying ships to castles in the sky. I also think that it was really nice how they brought the animals into the movie. I also thought that the cook was really funny. I have watched it many times in one day and still never tire of it.

'What a surprising treat to come across on late television. Had I only read a brief plot rundown on a television listing before seeing the movie I would have passed. The idea of a movie about a hit-man-seeing-a shrink-wanting-to leave-the-business-and-falling-in-love....sounds trite. But the film works. From the start of the movie its clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders before he even says a word. The look and feel of the film is perfect. dark but not obnoxiously so.<br /><br />Aside from the hit-man family aspect which provides a touch of surrealism Macys character grapples with his marriage and his fathers control. Macy shows a repressed sadness and his bedtime talks with his young son are amazing. The young boy shows acting skills well beyond his years and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural personal and loving.<br /><br />This is one of the best movies Ive seen in a while and I cant believe I came across it by accident on late night television.',pos
'The first part Che in Cuba is about that portion of his life. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded (remember that Che was a physician). It ends as Castro wins the revolution; Che never gets to Havana. The second part Che in Bolivia is about guess what. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded.<br /><br />When I realized this was supposed to be an epic (I never knew *anything* but the title before it started) I naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all David Leans Lawrence of Arabia. More of that later.<br /><br />Not to be a racist but aside from what Ive already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are well indistinguishable -- unknown Hispanic actors who look alike especially considering they all wear Che beards and all wear Che fatigues. This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very minor role). While del Toros terrific think of Lawrence with Peter OToole as the only discernible character: no Alec Guinness no Omar Sharif no Anthony Quinn etc. You get the idea.<br /><br />Because the other characters are interchangeable this results in a loss of reference. When top aides of Che are killed you feel no remorse since you dont know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I dont think thats a spoiler) theres no empathy from the audience -- hes just killed.<br /><br />Hes too one-dimensional to relate to as a human being. Aside from being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral rectitude the only thing we learn about Che is that hes married with five children (he tells another character that near the end). What was his motivation? A complete enigma.<br /><br />Maybe Soderbergh is purposely aping Lean. Like Soderberghs Che Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence the mystery man of Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and associates (Guinness Quinn). He was as courageous as he was insecure -- i.e. had human qualities. Che is like a machine about as warm as The Terminator.<br /><br />Earlier this year there was another war epic Mongol. Che makes Mongol look like Its a Wonderful Life.',neg

'CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; an Italian crime drama partially filmed in Hamburg Germany. An easily forgotten movie. Even in spite of a good car chase sequence this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly. A new Don takes over a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. Unwritten laws and ethics of the Mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence breed the same in return. This can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics. Just the look of the film brings back memories of American drive-in fare. Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas cant boost the calibre of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also stars with:Paola Tedesco Guido Lollobrigida Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.',neg
'Alone in the Dark is Uwe Bolls kick in the nuts to Hollywood after House of the Deads punch in the face.<br /><br />If anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator Boll is. After forcing Artisan out of business over the flop that was House of the Dead one can only assume the normally credible Lions Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisans assets. Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film-making ability plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movies framework.<br /><br />But then thats the point isnt it. Boll isnt trying to make a coherent film because he isnt trying to direct Alone in the Dark. Hes just trying to manipulate Hollywood.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark like House of the Dead Dungeon Siege Far Cry Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are announced or in pre-production.<br /><br />These arent movies to be directed but investment portfolios. Every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects he can release within that time-frame the more money he and his investors can gain. Why bother making a good movie when a bad movies making you a mint anyway? The result is movies like the awfulness of Alone in the Dark.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywoods current trend for lazy film-making.<br /><br />And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood congratulations by making a cult figure out of the man youre just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety.<br /><br />For more information read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=21699 As an aside just dont ask me how hes getting his cast-lists together.

'After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it oh OK Ill be generous and call it a star field we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth. A terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field. Three nearby campers investigate. From the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien the Nightbeast emerges OK so I lied its a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit. The campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeasts laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people. The towns Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) is informed. He alerts his deputy Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and gathers a posse of men together to investigate. Meanwhile the Nightbeast has killed an unlucky motorist who stopped on the side of the road for a leak. His two annoying kids run for help. They approach a house inside two young people are kissing the girl says someones running towards the house. The guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the Nightbeast it kills the girl as well. Then it manages to kill the two kids with his laser maybe the Nightbeast aint so bad after all. Once the Sheriff and his men arrive at the scene they have a gun/laser battle with the Nightbeast. After possibly the most unexciting gun fight in film history only the Sheriff his deputy and a local man Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel) survive. But the Nightbeast is still alive bullets seem to have no effect on it. The next day the Sheriff visits the towns Mayor Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) to get permission to evacuate everyone in the town. He refuses saying a party he is holding for the Governor (Richard Ruxton) cannot be cancelled and that he doesnt want to create a panic situation. The Sheriff evacuates the town anyway. Two doctors Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth) are attacked by the Nightbeast before they can leave. However they manage to scare the Nightbeast away and survive. Together with the Sheriff his deputy and Jamie they decide to stay behind and fight the alien. Written and directed by Don Dohler this has to be an amateur film made with family and friends look at the credits and see how many Dohlers are involved. For that reason I should probably cut it some slack but that still doesnt stop it or excuse it from being a throughly awful film in every department. It has no story or purpose things just happen to waste time whats with Drago (Don Leifert) strangling his ex girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? This and many more scenes add nothing to the film. The script has no logic either why does the Nightbeast stick around the town once its been supposedly evacuated? The special effects are embarrassingly bad just look at the effect when the Nightbeast shoots someone with his laser a computer effect an 80s spectrum would be ashamed of. Theres not really much blood or gore in it a ripped open stomach a severed arm and a decapitation but they all look predictably poor. Credit where its due the Nightbeast itself looks alright for the most part. Theres a sex scene between the Sheriff and his deputy which has to be seen to be believed music that even a porno would be embarrassed about and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to watch. Less than stellar acting photography music lighting and editing make it a real chore to sit through. And the worse thing about this film?

This film has all the earmarks of a Lifetime Special reject.<br /><br />I honestly believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo set out to create a thought-provoking emotional film on a tough subject exploring the idea that things are not always black and white that one who is a criminal by definition is not necessarily a bad human being and that there can be extenuating circumstances especially when one puts the well-being of a child first. However their earnestness ends up being channeled into preachy dialogue and trite situations planted to move the plot along. The decent production values and interesting use of documentary-style camera footage are not enough to accomplish their aim when the script and the acting fall flat.<br /><br />Logic is often compromised for the sake of creating tension: Soid first tries to blackmail Pablo into participating in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape then in the same breath basically tells him not to trust her because shes not helping them out of altruism. Well duh. And for a man on the run Pablo is far too swayed by a temper tantrum. Cristinas well-being is so important to him that hes fleeing capture and jail or deportation for her but hes willing to risk all that to appease her when she doesnt want to go to Mexico. Right. Talk above over-permissive parenting. Third when Pablos employer Charlie gives the phone to Detective Bright she is remarkably unprofessional especially given her seniority - did she really think she was persuasive? Oh yeah I would have turned myself in. CCH Pounders Detective Wims could wipe the floor with her.<br /><br />To be fair Id like to list the things I liked. Um I liked the midget. And I liked the fact that the midget was named Sexy. Theres cross-dressing always a plus; juvenile cross-dressing no less! Harry is infinitely cuter than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the film has to be when Cristina kicks Detective Not-So-Bright. I also find it interesting that in a heavily minority cast (which I much appreciate by the way) the black character is the racist one. Too bad its just thrown out there and not further explored.<br /><br />Theres a distinctive unconventional score but its nonetheless generally context-unspecific not enhancing mood or tension in any scene except the pathetic anguished wailing every time the main character is in anguish as though they think his acting doesnt show it enough: Just in case you werent sure hes upset and we have the musical cues to prove it.<br /><br />Stilted clichéd dialogue results in a depressing lack of subtext; everything has to be spelled out in dialogue even when the body language had been up til then conveying it just fine. For example every impassioned speech Pablo makes and Mrs. Knights lament that her child wont be crawling into bed with them in the morning.<br /><br />Papi tell me about Mama again - what shameless blatant exposition introducing the generic dead wife! (Shes always the most beautiful woman the widower had ever seen the kindest he had ever met. Why cant we see a man cry over a woman like Shakespeares - she may be fat ugly obnoxious but his love for her is deep as oceans? Now _theres_ a story which would move me.)<br /><br />The police always being literally one step behind them gives many scenes the out-of-place feeling of a French farce. Most boring foot chases ever - Bright and Lightning are so out-of-shape and easily-fooled (he certainly isnt quick as lightning and she well I dont feel the need to spell things out). Some guy dragging along a small child outrunning a bicycle cop complete with macho biker picking a fight but then being felled by a child? To quote Margaret Cho thats so sad. Would we ever see this on Cops ?<br /><br />Hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina: as an employer would you really waive checking his green card just because he can quote the author of the inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk?<br /><br />Plus several scenes including the above threaten to devolve into porn: Well Ill do this favor for you as long as you do something for me... I can almost hear the bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm.<br /><br />When the parents view the footage shot of Pablos remorse the grieving moms freak-out is the most real the movie feels. Unfortunately this is diminished by the fact that she looks completely swayed by his emotional speech right up until she goes ballistic. A more ambivalent look would be more convincing here.<br /><br />Im in constant awe of the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of plot: holding up a convenience store without a mask visiting the dead girls grave. And why doesnt the mother recognize his face from when she saw him before he drove off?! You seem awfully familiar...<br /><br />What is the purpose of that wholly unnecessary somewhat gratuitous scene with Soid and the artificially-enhanced bartender? Character development? Tch. Too little too late.<br /><br />Speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere Detective Lightnings saying skeptical Detective Bright must be a Scorpio shows how little he really knows about the occult. And I dont think that believing in fate quite qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />At the end when Bright holds Pablo as he dies - wait why does she care now? Her character is as inconsistent as Soids. What she has to shoot him just because she said Stop or Ill shoot? (Shes cared _so_much_ about her integrity thus far.) He was unarmed. There was no need for lethal force. Whats wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him?<br /><br />Finally Cristinas childlike acceptance of her mothers death giving Dr. Knight peace over his daughters death - so forced. And the contrivance of the family whose child was killed becoming Cristinas new family... It angers me that she could be a replacement for their little girl. Its also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the Latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter. Im not saying there arent generous loving people who would do that. Im just saying that the characters here are never developed far enough for me to believe that _they_ would do that.<br /><br />I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said that of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that dont wax sentimental in a manufactured manner.<br /><br />Co-writer co-director co-star Nebot said himself he wore too many hats during this production. Too many cooks may spoil the broth but one cook alone just might end up making an after-school special.<br /><br />In conclusion this films title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret helplessness and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again.',neg
'For those who like their films full of exploding planets and extreme violence this is definitely not one to see. In fact there is very little plot at all (or at least very little that could not be summarised in a few seconds: A meets B. Mr A falls for Mrs B and has an affair with her. A and B then fall in love and wonder (at great length) whether to have an affair themselves).<br /><br />This is Cantonese Visconti. Story there is none but what you DO get is a succession of wonderful images and poignantly trivial music which convey the slow passage of the central characters emotions. There is also the chance to see one of the worlds most beautiful women in a succession of stunningly elegant outfits. For my money its worth seeing for that alone. How could this woman ever have been an action heroine? She looks as though she has stepped straight out of the pages of Vogue.',pos
'This movie was so awful i dont even know where to begin...The only positive thing i can say about it is that Luke Perry gave a good performance. The entire movie was all over the place there was no explanation as to the cause(only theories)of the eruptions or rationals for their solutions or why it would work. It was ridiculous! All the characters and relationship between them was so cheesy you just wanna laugh!! There was just no background to any of them. The love relationship seemed to have been added on to the script it was so awkward. Theres an army man; big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth with the AaarrrGH!im the Man! attitude such a pathetic bad guy. The two sidekicks who are supposed to be geniuses are acting like two 16 year old frat boys. And then to create some action they decide to drop a rock on somebodys shoulder and for the rest of the movie hes coughing as if he was dying of a pneumonia or something...and then plays hero (cheesiest scene of all!!) to help the plan which is to do who knows what... its never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of THE dramatic scene...in a nutshell; dont waste your time!',neg
'I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned. From the domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos therein. Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fiction.<br /><br />Its bleak depressing and hopeless. While I dont mind a less than cheery ending Im really very tired of the humans suck cliché thats central to every movie. I know you cant get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race but hows bout as a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil! Right now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die just go out find a lake and swim til your arms are tired. This way you wont be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive. Its silly not thoughtful and boring.',neg
'The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie Ive yet run across. You would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie. Acting  Bad. Editing  Bad. Direction  Bad. Special Effects  Bad and Laughable. Plot  Bad. Lighting  Bad. Cinematography  Bad. Costume Design  Bad and Silly. Everything Else  Bad. Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies its a real endurance test. This is one for either masochists or Lou Ferrigno completists (if any exist).<br /><br />Eight things I learned from watching The Adventures of Hercules: <br /><br />1. If you dont have the budget for real special effects rotoscope a scene from the previous movie. It will look great - trust me.<br /><br />2. When on a quest to recover Zeus thunderbolts take time for frequent stops to oil-up you body. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions.<br /><br />3. Any sword fight use of magic and just about all other day to day activities in ancient Greece created a sound very similar to a game of Pac Man or Asteroids.<br /><br />4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed like extras from Star Wars.<br /><br />5. If you need to pad your crappy movies runtime extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music. It also helps if youve got a previous movie to pull scenes from.<br /><br />6. Fight scenes move along much smoother if the bad guys attack Hercules one at a time.<br /><br />7. William Berger did anything for money.<br /><br />8. I didnt think it was possible but The Adventures of Hercules makes the first film Hercules (1983) look like an Academy Award winner.',neg
'I dont doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Best Actor Oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the Mutiny on the Bounty leads of Clark Gable Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race. But The Informer is still a fine film because John Ford wouldnt have gotten his first Best Director Oscar if it wasnt. No split involved in his award.<br /><br />The movie and the story by Liam OFlaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in. Hes down to his last pence and if he cant get back in wants enough for passage to America. Theres a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan constabulary and informs on McPhillip.<br /><br />The IRA is pretty anxious to find out who ratted McPhillip out and theyre pretty certain it was McLaglen. He hasnt the wit to really cover his own tracks. He does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek. He also picks up a hanger-on played by J.M. Kerrigan.<br /><br />The whole action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning. Of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows making it possibly the first noir thriller. Had it been done post World War II The Informer would have ranked as a great noir classic like Odd Man Out or the The Third Man which it bares a lot of resemblance to.<br /><br />John Ford knew this world very well. He took some time off during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before having it anglicized was Sean OFiernan.<br /><br />Preston Foster plays the IRA commandant Dan Gallagher. In the book Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has him here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest. He makes it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informer because the Black and Tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril.<br /><br />The IRA trial scene is the highlight of the film. When Foster asks Donald Meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court Meek aint in a position to say no. The Kings justice and writ does not run here. It graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary the British are indeed losing their grip on the population.<br /><br />Of course The Informer a rather grim story has its John Ford touches but rather fewer than you would expect. Even as McLaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing.<br /><br />The Informer is a tale well told about Ireland in a grim and dismal time.',pos
'I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their normal guise to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!! I can remember all the acclaim Dustin Hoffmann got back in the 80s for his portrayal of autism in the film Rain Man - quite frankly (in my opinion of course!)Steven Robertsons performance/portrayal blows Dustin Hoffmanns right out of the water - and he deserves recognition as such!! All in all one of the greatest portrayals of human friendship/love/relationships ever - and it was made in Britain/Ireland with home grown actors - stick that in yer pipe and smoke it Hollywood!',pos
'To all the haters out there: condemning a TV series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages. That being said I was a huge fan of BSG thought it was some of the best TV drama (not just sci-fi) on the air. But it was time for it to end and the story to move on. I liked the BSG epilogue The Plan but it raised as many new questions as it answered so I eagerly anticipated Caprica and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I was hoping it would not try to be another BSG and I was pleased that Caprica is something different and I personally found the story exciting in a different way than blazing space battles explosions and sci-fi special effects (dont get me wrong I like that stuff too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give solid performances and Alessandra was just wonderful. I cant wait until next week.',pos

'I love cartoons. They can show things that films with real actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire (The Simpsons) good taste (South Park) spectacle (Aladdin) or reality (Toy Story). There are some good examples of this in Ice Age such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time its a really fun film. Sit back enjoy the deliberate anachronisms the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs.<br /><br />The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth Sid an idiotic sloth and Diego a sabretooth tiger as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way naturally they have a whole lot of problems. Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat historys unluckiest rodent who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers on top of dead trees in ice-caves. His opening scene is a classic.<br /><br />Its a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in but some of the scenes such as the nappy-changing or the dodos are hilarious the animals are likeable and it looks good. There is one quite touching moment too when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfreds eyes.<br /><br />Not a must-see but good for a fun hour or so.<br /><br />7/10',pos
'Once when I was in college and we had an international fair the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster saying Ne boltay! meaning Dont gossip!. I translated it for the generation of TV watchers as Dont be Gladys Kravitz! (in reference to the nosy neighbor on Bewitched).<br /><br />However when you see the result of gossip in the Pvt. Snafu short Rumors you see that its not quite a laughing matter. In this case the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis Powers have attacked the United States. So he tells it to someone who tells someone else who tells someone else and it continues. As in The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time so that when it gets back to Snafu...well you know what I mean! Yes its mostly WWII propaganda - complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese - but I have to say that the Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually quite funny. Of course since they had Dr. Seuss writing and Mel Blanc providing the voices its no surprise that these came out rather cool. Worth seeing.',pos
'Ill admit that I liked the first one and was really looking forward to the sequel.<br /><br />I was let down. Sure the special effects were technically amazing -- but they werent believable looking. It looked more like a cartoon. Alright I admit to liking 80\% of the chase scene -- but the fight with all the Mr Smiths? It was too obviously animated.<br /><br />I can accept all of that. What I cant accept is that the non-action parts were crap. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth I knew I was in for a speech that went on forever and signified nothing.<br /><br />I was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist. What this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie (except about the existence of the matrix). This movie was a little like seeing the episode of DALLAS where you find out that the entire previous season was a dream.<br /><br />Ugh! I want my $7.00 back!',neg
'Created in 1928 and originally named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed his name (because his wife convinced him) Mickey Mouse has become the staple of the Disney brand. I always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature Mickey it is in fact his third but it doesnt matter for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable. The story sees Mickey piloting a steamboat until Captain Pete takes him off the bridge stopping to pick up cargo and Minnie Mouse missing the boat. Being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them Mickey helps her crank its tail and play the tune and getting some other animals to be percussion until Pete comes along again to stop him making Mickey peel potatoes. Mickey Mouse was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons and he was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!',pos

'Where do you begin with a movie as bad as this?<br /><br />Do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes? The over-the-top acting? The dreadful script?<br /><br />No. You just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at. I know I do. I respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like Empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy isnt available to the quality movie mags). However cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isnt happy with the finished product.<br /><br />I went three days after it opened with two other mates. The only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own.<br /><br />And that was on cheap night.<br /><br />Either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is.<br /><br />Not since the days of The Avengers (1998) have I felt so short changed since watching a movie. If a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it.<br /><br />Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set; Keith Allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage; Barry Foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance Rhys Ifans does his career no favours after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary.<br /><br />Mind you considering she used to be in The Word any viewers expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with.<br /><br />The production values arent bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious. If you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say Fak! for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street.<br /><br />Otherwise bargepoles required.<br /><br />',neg
'We have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie. Basically Dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart named Neweyes(which I needed after I watched this movie). Apparently Neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that Dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation. The dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter(Too bad the screenwriters didnt have it). By the way does it seem weird that out of ALL the wishes of the children in the world Neweyes grants the wish of bringing Dinosaurs to modern times? Why not grant the wishes of kids to stop famine? Disease? War? I mean come on! Doesnt Neweyes have anything better to do with all this power he has??? Finally when the Dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing dancing and wrecking havoc(basically the kind of thing you might see on a bad LSD trip I mean where else could you see a T-Rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of Spider-man?). They end up in the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes(???) makes the kids that have befriended the dinosaurs sign a blank contract. Why? Why would kids sign a blank contract??? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some...Brain-Drain That he will let the children go. The dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil Screweyes limb from limb give in and agree to his terms. What?! This is stupid! They could have just menaced him made him drop the contract eaten it then walked off with the kids. I think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop Screweyes and apparently completely eat him. Oh yeah thats not violent at all! Were back makes no sense its not fun its goofy its stupid poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film.

'George P. Cosmatos Rambo: First Blood Part II is pure wish-fulfillment. The United States clearly didnt win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic bemoans that US-Americans didnt appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. Like every film that defends the war (e.g. We Were Soldiers) also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia. And for that matter also the reason for every single US-American soldier that was there. Instead Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them. Do we get to win this time? Yes you do.',neg
'Half Past Dead starring Steven Seagal in the main role was a major B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something. Its less entertaining than the first one: in all aspects. But its although worthy a look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch former WWE stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels even if they are direct or not.<br /><br />Kurupt did a good job Bill Goldberg was below the average I think he isnt made to the job. Kurupt is a good comedian I say. The rest did the job but nothing amazing nothing far from alright.<br /><br />Technical details well a production made by Sony cant be great. Cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable. Whatever just watch it if you want. If you watch you wont lose anything. But if you dont... well you wont lose either.',neg
'This film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war period it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema. Recently it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as The Deer Hunter.) I like it but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.<br /><br />The tale is a simple one. Three very different servicemen who have mustered out after World War II (The Big One!) fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume or create civilian lives. One has a disability one has a cushy job waiting for him and the other has nothing to go on but determination.<br /><br />There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for playing an old Sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for Its a Wonderful Life which also deserved the Best Picture Award but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. As I said it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real WWII hero Pappy Boyington and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.<br /><br />I am going against the grain here but I thought that Myrna Loy who played Marchs wife was justly ignored by the Academy. I detected barely a hint of warmth from her. In fact I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. I think all this nonsense about her being the perfect wife is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that but the Academy voters apparently did not. She is a major problem with this film terribly miscast.<br /><br />Dana Andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero then winds up behind the counter again is amazing. He is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons and his future looks bleak. But then he chances upon Marchs daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright in a fantastic turn) and fireworks explode. Both are great but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude punctuated by the all-time classic line Im going to bust that marriage up! The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.<br /><br />Speaking of uplifting now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting or is it non-acting that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation he is an inspiration. His best scene one of the best in all cinema is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. Im lucky I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys. Truly great stuff.<br /><br />The film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points.',pos
'Bo Derek will not go down in history as a great actress. On the other hand starting in the 1980s actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in Hollywood so Bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of Blake Edwards 10. That is if she hadnt allowed her husband John Derek to take over her career. Numerous Playboy spreads and bad movies like this one (this one in particular) directed by John destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke. In the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold. John figured that putting Bo in a movie wherein she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the 10 hype. Maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps. This version of Tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many iterpretations of Burroughs lord of the jungle a slap in the face to characters book and film legacy. Tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for Bos breasts and Richard Harris wonderful over acting (remember the pair had worked together in Orca). His scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes the film is quite boring. Nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance. Bos body can only get you so far. Miles OKeeffe who played Tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable B movie career and Richard Harris can put this behind him after his recent acting triumphs but Bo and John Derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first place.<br /><br />And how did the orangutan get to Africa?',neg
'Perhaps once in a generation a film comes along that is perfection. For me The Railway Children is that film - a timeless classic that was directed and performed most beautifully. It depicts all that is worthwhile in humanity and climaxes in the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice. Every performance is a gem though Bobbie stands out and like Judy Garland as Dorothy before her Jenny Agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine anyone else in the role.<br /><br />The world is all the better for this film and the children of today would be much the better for watching it.<br /><br />Of course like so many young men of my generation I fell hopelessly in love with Jenny Agutter and her hold was as strong when I had the great good fortune to meet her a few days ago - the bewitching smile and voice like dripping honey were still there to send me weak at the knees as they first did all those years ago!',pos

Cohan Fanny Brice Gertrude Lawrence) the most accessible piece of film footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT them in which theyre portrayed by other actors: Somebody Loves Me starring Betty Hutton and that inimitable song-and-dance man Ralph Meeker.<br /><br />In their heyday Fields and Seeley were so hugely popular that another husband-and-wife vaudeville act -- Jesse Block and Eve Sully -- achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act effectively becoming the second-team Fields and Seeley. Offstage though there was a major difference in the couples living arrangements. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites paying room-service rates for every meal they ate and eventually running out of money. Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely ending in comfortable retirement.<br /><br />The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone short are occupied by two spats-wearing pianists. Apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930 although Ive never heard of them. Finally Fields and Seely rush in and start performing. They both have plenty of pep and shes fairly attractive.<br /><br />I was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if theyre about to break into a dance but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short. When they finally start hoofing the results are not impressive.<br /><br />I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act. Now that Ive seen it I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals. My rating for this one: just 4 out of 10 and Ill stick with Block and Sully.',neg
'I actually was looking forward to this movie. After reading a number of reviews before the release it sounded like a genuinely nice film one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.)<br /><br />Well it might have been all of those things BUT it is so boring that I defy almost anyone to sit through this in its entirety and keep attention. Also Cages attempt at speaking with an Italian accent is embarrassingly bad. Hes such a good actor that I cringed every time he spoke in this film. <br /><br />Disappointing seems to be the most-often word used by reviewers here to describe this film and I totally agree.<br /><br />I guess it didnt take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because like Cages accent it did not do well.',neg
'The Movie is not bad in itself...till you see the original movie Hitch(2005) starring Will Smith. The movie is a straight copy with even the dialogs for most part of the movie simply translated from English to Hindi! The plot in the original is tightly executed. The Hindi version fails to keep the viewers interested. The over-the-top kind of comedy of David Dhawan seems to have gone overboard with Govinda hysterically shouting at all times...sometimes more time is spent in understanding the reason for that than the plot. :)<br /><br />If you know English which I assume you know given that you are reading this see the Hollywood original. At least watch Hitch if you have watched Partner to be able to compare. This is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work I am sad to say is shamelessly lifted by inspired people like David Dhawan.',neg
'As a fan of Science-fiction movies I have been aware of The Matrix since its release in 1999. From the little bit I would allow people to tell me about it I assumed it was highly original and sophisticated. I am also a devotee of Alice in Wonderland. I could never quite figure out how I missed The Matrix when it was released. With the imminent release of The Matrix Reloaded it was time to buy the DVD and watch it.<br /><br />The disappointment was too great. The premise of the matrix (the controlling device as opposed to the movie) was clever. The philosophical premise of parallel worlds alternate realities is shopworn. However I could still have bought into the film as science-fiction if it stayed firmly in that genre. Unfortunately it turned into a standard will they or wont they escape break through rescue those in need of rescue etc. To make matters worse it turned out to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that science-fiction and martial arts films are really two different types. To the purest the devotee of one or the other mixing the two doesnt work. It is like mixing science-fiction with romance. You can have one or the other but not both in the same film or at least not both to the same extent in the same movie.<br /><br />If there were such problems with The Matrix The Matrix Reloaded really compounded the problems. At least thirty minutes of the film were either martial arts sequences or the protracted car-chase. (This observation ignores the question made in every professional negative review of the movie: If Neo could do the Superman thing why bother to fight at all? The answer of course is thats what draws the young male demographic group into the theatre.) Then there is the redemption through love aspect. That plot device was worn out by Richard Wagner over a hundred years ago. It was actually handled better by him in Die Gotterdammerung.<br /><br />So where does that leave those who saw the Matrix Reloaded. Martial arts fans probably groaned through the trite but arcane sci-fi philosophizing. Science fictions fans were wondering why they were sitting through a kung-fun fest. Most of the males in the audience where probably bored by the silly romance aspect of the film.<br /><br />Just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see The Matrix franchise films: Science fiction martial arts or soap opera? A bit of each does not make for a whole lot more of any of them nor for a satisfying film for the afficionados of each.',neg
'Shaggy friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message: if you want to make it in this world being imaginative isnt enough you have to live up to your place in society and that means living by the (heterosexual) rules that govern us. Drag queen comedy-drama from Australia is a mostly upbeat journey of three male friends traveling across the Outback in their pink bus christened Priscilla. While not a formula film per se there are the obligatory road movie sequences (bonding by the bonfire facing down the rednecks etc.). Writer-director Stephan Elliott follows every potentially mean-spirited moment with a little humor and sympathy but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative a dire subplot about a gay mans relationship with his ex-wife and estranged pre-teen son (both of whom are comfortable--and the child wise--with his lifestyle) and a third act with no energy whatsoever. It has some wicked transvestite humor and a fairly game cast but a script that seems to have been watered down along the way. ** from ***',neg
'After Loomis gives a quick recap of Micheal Myers we flashback to 1989 where Jamie is kidnapped by the Man in Black before the burning police station explodes. Micheal returns to Haddonfeild once again to find Jamie and his baby. In this version the Loomis character gets more scenes and seems much more pro-active than he is in the final cut. The Score is much better more in line with parts 4 and 5 none of the electric guitar BS. And the ending makes a tad more sense. For these reasons coupled with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense and cuts back on the gore factor (Halloween unlike say the Friday the 13th Franschise was never about blatant gore) is why I prefer this bootleg Producers cut. Not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold it just polishes the turd a little bit and makes it more comprehensible. The whole cult plot is still very stupid as is Micheal fathering a kid <br /><br />My Producers Cut Grade: C- <br /><br />My Theatrical Cut Grade: D-',neg
'I discovered this late one night on Turner Classics. I kept saying to myself Ill turn it off as soon as it stops being funny but needless to say I watched the whole way through.<br /><br />I am a movie junkie but I had never even HEARD of this movie (or if I did in 1971 I forgot). Its worth watching just for the performance of Goldie Hawn as the tart-tongued ingénue. Her acting is a revelation in this movie. Yes the script is sharp and excellent (when was the last time they made a Hollywood comedy with a smart script?) but her acting is extraordinary. I never realized how funny Goldie could be and it makes her later appearances in roles such as Laugh-In and Private Benjamin a little sad. In her later career she is far too over-the-top compared to her minimalist wickedly funny appearance here.<br /><br />Its a pleasure watching the young Matthau the great Bergman and the stellar supporting cast but its Goldie Hawn that will make this movie worth watching again.',pos
'This movie was bad to say the least!!! The plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have have been showcased in this LAME movie. It starts off with a race from L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min...in a Ferrari F430. I did that in 1HR 50min in a tiny 4cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously...this movie does not do justice to these cars. Obviously these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2 oclock. I remember seeing on the news how Eddie Griffin crashed a 1.5 million dollar Ferrari Enzo going 30-40MPH>>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /><br />And...the director ANDY CHENG is THE biggest SELLOUT!!! He brings shame to his own race. I wonder just how many people he orally pleased just to break into Hollywood. He partook in a movie that portrays Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE way. Asian women>>cheap money grubbing whores. Asian men>>losing compulsive gamblers & thugs that get beat all the time . What the heck is all the fear about asians?? Why the need to always portray them in such a negative connotation?? I am SO sick of the way Hollywood ALWAYS portrays asians in SUCH a negative and false pretext.',neg
'This has got to be one of the worst movies Ive ever seen! There were people leaving the theatre others were falling asleep (ok it was a late night show)... This is a no-sense movie one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again. I would love to watch the making-off of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage. Do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think theyre doing something interesting? I wonder... The soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album. Even if youre a fan of Bjorks music stay home. Its the best thing to do. The little tiny pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture. God!...',neg

'This is very much not the sort of movie for which John Wayne is known. He plays a diplomat a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action. The film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story.<br /><br />For the open-minded the patient and the thoughtful this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history.<br /><br />There are two intertwining stories. The big story is of internalised isolationist Japan and externalised expansionist America clashing when their interests conflict. The small human story is of an outsider barbarian (Wayne) and a civilised Geishas initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love. The human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations.<br /><br />The movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well. The two lead roles are performed to perfection. John Wayne is excellent as Townsend Harris striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in his dealings with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is likewise excellent as the Geisha of the title charming and delightful. The interaction between her character and John Waynes is particularly well portrayed. This is exactly how these two individuals (as they are depicted in the film) would have behaved.<br /><br />The script is very well written. It lacks all pomposity. and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred. The characters are real people not self-consciously great figures from history. Furthermore the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety. Indeed the clash of a traditionalist and traditionally powerful isolationist Japan and a rising newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in Japan and that passing ships cannot even put into port for water. The Baron responds that Japan just wants to be left alone. Waynes character replies that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important roadway. A very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right and saw the other as being in the wrong. The resultant clash between two self-righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future.<br /><br />Cinematography and the depiction of mid-nineteenth century Japan before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century is excellent. A visual treat and an enlightening insight into Japans ancient civilisation.<br /><br />I highly recommend anyone whether a John Wayne fan or not to watch this film if you get the chance. Just be aware that it isnt an action film. It is a representation of an interesting place and time in history and a slow-boiling love story which (much to their surprise) comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this film on its merits without preconceptions allow yourself to be immersed in its story and you will thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />All in all an excellent film.',pos
'Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.<br /><br />The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in Even Stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.<br /><br />A old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.',pos
'Alan Alda plays real-life Sports Illustrated writer George Plimpton who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Rather wan uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy. Director Alex March takes an interesting tack on this material shooting it in a quasi-documentary fashion (with macho commentary) and yet giving the tale a touch of Capraesque whimsy; still by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set-up he turns the main narrative into a jumble. Aldas smug uncharismatic performance is another handicap though the supporting cast is filled with real-life pro-athletes (and scintillating Lauren Hutton as Aldas girlfriend--hows that for a fantasy?). *1/2 from ****',neg
'Octavio Paz Mexican poet writer and diplomat who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990 said about Nazarin: Nazarin follows the great tradition of mad Spaniards originated by Cervantes. His madness consists in taking seriously great ideas and trying to live accordingly. A humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a wonderful performance) attempts to live by the principles of Christianity but is cast out of his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she had committed a murder. Nazarin wanders the country roads of the turn of the 20th-century Mexico offering help to poor and begging for food. His two followers a murderous prostitute Andara and her sister Beatriz who is a failed suicide desperately searching for love consider him saint but it does not prevent him from hatred and humiliation from both the church and the people he meets on the road. He ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not be able to forgive his attacker. <br /><br />Bunuel tells the story in a manner of a Christian parable masterfully and uniquely combining admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and profound as well as beautiful ironic and heartbreaking.<br /><br />I consider Bunuel one of the best filmmakers ever. Ive seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life but they have in common his magic touch the masterful combination of gritty realism and surrealism his curiosity his inquisitive mind his sense of humor and his dark and shining fantasies. With great pleasure I am adding little seen and almost unknown but amazingly candid and touching surrealistic tragic-comedy Nazarin to the list of my favorite films.',pos
'Out of these Pokemon films (which are in order of best to least for me): Pokemon The First Movie Pokemon 4Ever Pokemon Heroes Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and the Unknown this is probably the one most concerning the environment arguably the most beautiful and the most calming one. Whether these are good points for you or not Pokemon 4Ever still has entertained many.<br /><br />As well as the three points covered above this pokemon film includes good humour and good CGI (as well as anime). The time travelling theme of the film is represented in a good way and Team Rocket (the comic reliefs/rubbish baddies) end up with quite good gags and end up being more main characters than sidekicks. <br /><br />The flaws are as always the rather unnecessary violence and action and the baddie is pretty uninteresting even more so than a few Pokemon film baddies. <br /><br />A strange pokemon is being tracked down by a pokemon hunter in a forest.

'OK last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schraders The Exorcist: The Beginning at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films. With all the commotion around the film it was highly anticipated.<br /><br />The director was there and so were most of the stars (except Skarsgard).<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie sucked big time. It was a real disappointment for me because Im a huge fan of both Shrader and Friedkins (RIP) original 1973 film.<br /><br />What was wrong with it? Most of it actually. The FX (you would think that the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never happened: it was so badly rendered!) the editing (no real pace or rhythm) the acting (only Skarsgard at times could convince). The script was a IMO set up to explain the African scenes in the original film. So the movie had the feel of a set up scene only it contributed nothing.<br /><br />The only thing that I did like was Vittorio Storaros cinematography although Ive seen better from him (Apocalyps Now).<br /><br />All of the time I was thinking this was just a rough cut a work in progress. And that given the (well known) circumstances is probably what it is. But that doesnt change the obvious problems with the script.<br /><br />I had the chance to meet Schrader (very briefly) but I didnt have the guts to tell him what I thought of the film and I was so nervous (this is the guy who wrote Taxi Driver for Christ sake!!) that I forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his Taxi Driver script...',neg
'My first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $5.00. But since it featured Sandra Bullock who I generally like I bought it. My disappointment with the film began almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and stiff. The color is distorted. I kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. The acting is amateurish. Even the killing scenes are a failure. Twice dead people moved their legs. When my cash-deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie I immediately and joyfully complied. This is an amazingly bad movie. Tomorrow I am giving this dvd away at the company white elephant Christmas party.',neg

'This is a funny clever film and well worth your time. In my opinion it is much better than American Pie and other films of the same genre that seem to get knocked out all the time. I hadnt heard of this film so I guess it didnt get much press which is kind of a shame. It doesnt take itself too seriously but at the same time delivers a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is important...As opposed to a film about a bunch of desperate guys trying to get laid for the first time and one dude sticking his d**k in a pie but in the end everyone gets laid and whoop-de-do... One thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy American pop-punk...They actually had real punk from back in the day like the Ramones...That in itself made the film better! To be honest I wasnt expecting much from this film and I was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy it is.',pos
'The dead spots and picture-postcard superficiality of Out of Africa just about buried any interest I might have had to read Isak Dinesen. So when my brother bought me Babettes Feast and knowing it was based on a Dinesen story I didnt exactly race to the VCR. But as the titles rolled it became clear that this was no ordinary movie. Jutland (where its set) is not Africa; the chill mist that collects on the camera shots is not inviting. The cold forbidding sea; the heavy gray clouds; the pale icy green cliffs--translate to hardships that show on the faces over which director Gabriel Axel draws the curtain. The craggiest is Bodil Kjers as Philippa; amid the myriad merits of this movie the most memorable is that face. It stands like a map laying before us the cherished wonder of her minister fathers apostolate; like a maze of long-overlooked fjords where the complications of her congregations perseverance and commitment hang like gleaming escutcheons.<br /><br />I gather its Dinesens point how the world is drawn inexplicably to Christian dedication when Philippa is rejected by her only serious suitor (because he fears hell never measure up to the rules and rigors of her small religious clique) and he returns to find her mistress of whom he regards as the greatest chef on the continent. I figure its also her point that Christ answers the doubts and regrets of those who give up worldly success (Philippas sister Martina rebuffs efforts by a visiting baritone (Jean-Philippe Lafont whose jolliness creates an uplifting counterpoint to the sparsity of spirit that surrounds his discovery) to turn her into an opera star; the title character leaves France and an enviable reputation and seeks sanctuary as the servant of two spinster sisters) to pursue artistic triumphs for only God and those closest to Him to witness. But its Axel who weaves the asperity of these peoples lives with the richness of Martinas voice and Babette Hersants table and effects a sumptuousness youd never expect from a movie about sacrifice faith and religious conviction.<br /><br />What sets this movie apart from other religious movies is its sly humor. Babettes Feast that is the banquet itself--a posthumous commemoration of the ministers 100th birthday--is a beautifully orchestrated clash of sensibilities that delivers comic moments by an ensemble of actors that are unparalleled in their subtlety. Its just this deft comedy that enriches the solemn sentiments at closing. Together they do something pious movies seldom do. They leave a believer tremulously hopeful and unexpectedly resolute and humbled.',pos
'Thomas Ince always had a knack for bringing simple homespun stories to life with fullness and flair. The Italian is such a film. Solid acting particularly by George Beban father of silent child actor George Beban Jr. and wonderful sets convey a realistic feeling of early immigrant tenements in New York. These give this 1915 film an authenticity which is unusual in features of this vintage.<br /><br />The film begins with the modern day and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) reading a story about an Italian immigrant and then we transition into the story with George playing the immigrant. He raises enough money to bring his fiancée from Italy to America marries her and has a son with her. But times are hard and the family struggles to survive. I found myself wondering why the mother didnt breastfeed her child and avoid the complications with the dirty formula but oh well even the early Dream Factory was pushing political correct behaviour for women in 1915!<br /><br />The best scene in the picture is when Beban has a chance to seek revenge on a crime boss who inadvertently put him in jail and at the last minute he decides against his planned course of action. Very neat. I loved the curtain effect it was great. Wonderful use of lighting in this film.<br /><br />I give The Italian an 8 out of 10.',pos
'**SPOILERS** Since the disappearance at sea of her favorite niece Phyllis murder mystery writer Abigail Mitchell Ruth Gordon has strong suspicions that it was Phyllis husband Edmund Galvin Charles Frank who was responsible for her death. In fact Abigail is convinced that he murdered her and made it look like a tragic accident.<br /><br />Knowing that theres no evidence to have Edmund arrested for Phyillis death and deciding to take the law into her own hands Abigail cooks up this elaborate plan to do him in and make it look like Phyllis death a tragic accident. Getting Edmund to secretly come over to her mansion to give him the combination to her walk-in safe as shes about to leave on vacation for New York City Abigail tricks him into going inside locking the startled and surprised Edmund in. With the safe being soundproof nobody at the mansion the butler maid and Abigails personal secretary Veronica Mariette Hartley hear him screaming for help and the next day Edmund is found suffocated to death. Veronica discovered Edmunds body as she was about to put away for safe keeping Abigails latest murder mystery manuscript.<br /><br />Lt. Columbo Peter Falk is called on the case involving the strange death of Edmund Garvin to determine if its a murder or a tragic accident. Going through Edmunds apartment Columbo is puzzled to find out that he doesnt have a single photo of his late wife whos been missing for just a month! This ties into what Abigail always felt about him in Edmund not being in love with Phyllis and also a suspect in her in Abigails mind murder. <br /><br />Columbo a big fan together with his wife of Abigails murder mystery novels has a hard time realizing that she in fact was responsible for Edmunds death. All the evidence points to Abigil including a pair of missing car keys that was Edmunds. This all proved that Abgail was in fact in the house not on her way to the airport when Edmund was locked inside the walk-in safe.<br /><br />Going through all the evidence Columbo comes up with this strange conclusion that Edmund must have left some evidence inside the safe in writing to who his killer is. That conclusion is quickly checkmated when its found out that Edmund didnt even have a pen or pencil as well as light with the safe light-bulb burned out on him to write it. Theres also something very odd thats inside the safe that has been on Lt. Columbos mind ever since he came on the case. This has to do with the black paint residue that was found under the dead Edmunds fingernails and on his belt buckle! <br /><br />Its that evidence when put together with a number of other items in the safe that in the end hangs Edmunds murder on the tricky and very cunning mystery writer Abigail Mitchell. Edmund let Abigail unknowingly convict herself in his final attempt as the air in the safe was being used up by his breathing in using burnt out matchsticks to write on Abigail last manuscript who murdered him: Abigail Mitchell!',pos
'I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show thanks to the many sight gags non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. <br /><br />But unfortunately ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode. One that I remember was in the opening where the episodes title was different from the one shown on the screen. <br /><br />Leslie Nielsens portrayal of Frank Drebin was deadpan yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible wasnt bad as Norberg But the one character that stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin there were cameos from Dick Clark Dr. Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda. <br /><br />Even though Police Squad! had a short life on ABC the Zucker Brothers didnt give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise. Ill close with a regular closing gag. Freeze the ending right here.',pos

'Anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film. Its interesting they titled it The Hole! The production values are good for a short film. The hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on. I speculate if this was shot on 35mm it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat. Many hollywood movies look good and thats enough for an audience regardless of story and content.<br /><br />My honest opinion 3 out of 10 for this effort.

'When i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies.. I watched then with very low expectations. Now this movie isnt bad per se. You get what you pay for. It is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. Despite the bad acting cliché lines and sub par camera work. I didnt have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my DVD player.

'What a GREAT movie! This is so reminiscent of the wonderful Disney classic family movies of the 60s and the 70s. I was so pleasantly surprised after the past 20 years of absolute detritus Disneys live productions crews have churned out.<br /><br />This movie is an absolute joy. The child stars were just that; professional quality actors. I am most impressed with the quality of this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was a total sycophantic *insert hyperbole here* running a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was wonderful as the stars mother.<br /><br />I wont recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again but the story is wonderful the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb! This work reminds you what its like to be a child without going all sugary or being too grim. The deleted scenes featured on the DVD version were truly best left deleted. They were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent. It was best that way.<br /><br />This was an absolutely delightful movie to watch.<br /><br />It gets a 9/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.',pos

'FREDDY FORSYTH has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the Wests suspicions about Putins Russia. Forsyth installs a nasty guy as the Ruski president who wants to return the country - not so much to Stalins Communism but more to Hitlerian Fascism. In fact his Political Manifesto could have come straight out of Mein Kampf rather than Marx. And the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the Russian Federation. American mercenaries connive with the Russian Prez to realise his fanatical genocidal dream but then enter Dirty Dancings Pat Swayze...andyepthings get really down and dirty. Hes a former US operative-turned-drifterJason Monk who is enlisted by the British Government to see what the Russians are up to. As a corny sidebar Swayzes character who is no Monk (!)has sired a Russian beauty Elena (played by the gorgeous Marta Kondova) on his previous missions to the former Commie state. Hardman Swayze does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil Russians. But young unknown actress Marta Kondova steals the flick as his nubile 18-year-old Russian daughter Elena who helps dad root out the terror threatening her beloved Mother Russia.',neg
'This movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time...if you suffer from insomnia. It is a fool-proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. As the movie slowly progresses the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain. This effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action/sweet babes.<br /><br />Also Mr. Eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of montage. A prime example of this is the scene on the Odessa steps. For no apparent reason an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer. This editing flaw tarnishes any sort of realism in the entire film. Honestly ive seen more realistic editing watching cartoons.<br /><br />Some individuals who have commented on this title have hailed Battleship Potemkin as: One of the greatest movies of all time and Truly a masterpiece. Well im writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this film at all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. Surely what they meant to say was: One of the greatest snooze-fests of all time and Truly an epic fail.<br /><br />In conclusion dont waste your time. If you are interested in watching a movie of far superior quality go to www.youtube.com and watch a Halo 3 montage. If i played the movie Battleship Potemkin in a game of slayer on guardian i would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then teabag its dead body. PEACE!',neg
'This movie is about a fictional soap opera. It is very fast and funny. To say anything else would ruin the movie. There are several plots and sub plots in the movie. This movie has ensemble cast with todays hottest stars. They all gives over the top performances. This movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera /or prime time soap opera!!!If you watch soap go check this movie its hilarious!!!',pos
'My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahns search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father Louis Kahn dead since 1974. The film builds slowly but perfectly and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomethings identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love loss family and perhaps more importantly our lifes work.<br /><br />I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work. Through the words (both good and bad) of Louis Kahns colleagues you get a very good sense of what Nathaniel must have felt as memories are recalled and stories retold. Sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling Nathaniel how to feel about his father. As I listened to each recollection my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible sometimes in the span of a moment so you get a good feel for the rollercoaster that Nathaniels emotions must have been riding.<br /><br />The final sequence in Bangladesh totally made the film for me. The reverence of which the people of Bangladesh spoke of Louis Kahns work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me and hopefully for Nathaniel.<br /><br />I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for.',pos
'I watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh ive had in a long while. The plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way. The only plus to be found anywhere in the film are Corey Saviers impressive abs. Alexandra Paul (i think thats her name) is horrendous as the preachers wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is gross and his characters a twit on top of it all. And as if the fact that you think shes having sex with her son isnt enough they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity! The end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable.

'Meek tiny almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something enormous out of it.

'One of the great things about The Best Years of Our Lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post World War II era the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on V-E or V-J day of 1945. The problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet.<br /><br />And while we dont often learn from history we can be thankful that for once the United States of America did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous World War. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing in The Best Years of Our Lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century. So many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like Fredric March Dana Andrews and Harold Russell who you see here.<br /><br />All three of those actors played archetypal veterans characters that every corner of the USA could identify with. They all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them Boone City Iowa.<br /><br />War is a great leveler of class and distinction. Bank employee March soda jerk Andrews and high school football star Russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like Boone City. But they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken.<br /><br />March is the oldest a man with two children and Hollywoods perfect wife Myrna Loy. He settles in the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms.<br /><br />I also love his scene where another returning veteran a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. Watch Marchs expressions as he listens to the mans pitch for money. You can feel him read the mans soul. Its what got him his Second Best Actor Oscar for this film.<br /><br />Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the Pacific. He got a special recognition Oscar for his performance. Because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the Supporting Actor category which he also won in. His performance especially his scenes with Cathy ODonnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands is beyond anything that could be described as acting.<br /><br />Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three a bombardier in the Army Air Corps. Of the group of them maybe he should have stayed in. He also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. That uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him. The problem is that hes considerably less in her eyes as a civilian.<br /><br />While Mayo is fooling around with Steve Cochran Andrews has the great good fortune to have Marchs daughter Teresa Wright take an interest in him. Theyre the main story of the film Andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman. Not all veterans problems were solved with GI Bill.<br /><br />Myrna Loy gets little recognition for The Best Years of Our Lives. My guess is that its because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at MGM. Still as wife to March and mother to Wright she really is the glue that holds that family together.<br /><br />The Best Years of Our Lives won for Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn Best Director for William Wyler and a few others besides the two acting Oscars it got. It was a critical and popular success possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries. Its almost three hours in length but never once will your interest wane.<br /><br />The best tribute this film received came from Frank Capra who had a film of his own in the Oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories. In his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the Oscars that year but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it.<br /><br />By the way the film Capra had hopes for was Its A Wonderful Life. The Beat Years of Our Lives cant get better praise than that.',pos
'I just watched The Dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years ago.<br /><br />Its not a big movie and doesnt try to make a big splash but my God the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.<br /><br />The Dresser is the story of Sir an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney) and his dresser Norman (Courtenay) sort of a valet putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anyway.<br /><br />This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor. He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when theyre taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use though. For although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.<br /><br />Yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are Finney Courtenay and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there arent other fine performances most notably Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been.<br /><br />Although it doesnt get talked about these days it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay Best Picture Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />I had remembered this as being a good movie but I wasnt prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then I encourage you to see The Dresser.',pos
'Oh this is such a glorious musical. Theres a bit of miscasting -- Frank Sinatra is sorely miscast as the Jewish Nathan Detroit though it only becomes evident on Sue Me which is a distinctly Jewish song. Sadly the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show Marry the Man Today and replaced it with an inferior Sinatra showpiece. With these two flaws in mind the movie is otherwise magnificent. Jean Simmons shines as Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando cant sing worth beans but pulls it off anyway. Stubby Kaye wonderfully reprises his Broadway role (it was written for him). Damon Runyons language and pacing and humor come through quite well. This is on my see-it-every-chance-I-get list.',pos
'The only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack their choices and viewpoints and the philosophical questions that it raises. Tru feels that she is helping people who arent supposed to die and Jack feels that they are supposed to die and she is messing with fates plan or the universes plan or such-whatnot.<br /><br />But she is obviously able to change things so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the series metaphysics. Jack has no basis for believing that there is. And very conveniently Tru never asks him the right questions. Nobody does. Which obviously proves that the makers of the series dont have an answer.<br /><br />There simply is no plot!<br /><br />Instead they leave it murky in order for the series to be able to continue with its boring girl stuff only occasionally interrupted by Tru and Jacks racing against each other towards ends that are unknown...<br /><br />It turns out that there is nothing to any of it. A teenage pop series with that pretends to be something else.<br /><br />Your time will be better spent sleeping.',neg
'In Iran women are not admitted to soccer games. Officially its because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it is about sexism. Women are lower forms of human beings.<br /><br />Some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks. They are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage until the police will come and pick them up.<br /><br />Despite the insane situation this is a film with lots of humor. Its also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression. Youll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs. Good job by director Jafar Panahi.

'For the life of me I cant understand the good reviews on this piece of crap. It was pointless. Matthew Modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man. Gina Gershon well others have said it but Ill reiterate why the stupid accent? Totally unnecessary. And her acting was just bad. I dont know if she was thrown by the accent or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /><br />And the girl Modine was in love with suddenly shes shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way? Where did that come from? I think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble but frankly I couldnt care less about any of these people.',neg
'Another gray horrible bit of schlockiness from the family Corman. The first space capsule into outer space crash lands back on Earth(with some of the worst special effects ever) and the pilot appears to be dead. But appearances can be deceiving. Hes actually more alive than the rest of the cast including a patronizing misogynist old doctor(whod also really REALLY boring) a greasy guy who looks like hes cornered the market on hair oil another guy so dull he doesnt even make much of an impression a female scientist who never seems to be hurt or angry over the old guys patronizing and a female photographer with a Farah Fawcett haircut(pre-Farah of course) and about as much liveliness as a dead duck.<br /><br />What are any of these peoples names? I think it was Steve. Apparently everyone in the cast including the women were called Steve. Anyway the dead pilot Steve turns out to not only be alive but to be incubating baby aliens(or seahorses or shrimp or whatever) inside his torso. The Momma beast that implanted these little critters looks like a giant bald parrot with claws. Once again I am impressed by the laugh-ability factor of the monsters created by the House of Corman. The space carrot from Venus in It Conquered the World is still officially the worst most laughable monster Ive ever seen grace the screen but the Cormans always manage to deliver when it comes to bad cheesy looking monsters.<br /><br />They also managed to deliver on their other trademarks as well; i.e. a boring confusing plot long gray shots(thank God Corman did most of his films in black and white since his color stuff still manages to look somehow gray)two or three locations max stupid and lame props and special effects and lots and lots of dull dialog. Theres only two deaths in the film(if you dont counted the roasted parrot..err..alien blood beast being offed at the end of the film). Cheers rang out through the land Im sure when the alien rips the old doctors head off and(apparently) eats it. Now it can talk in English and has the doctors memories. It can also move the pregnant astronaut around as though he were Pinnochio. <br /><br />The monsters apparent intent is to rebuild its race using human beings as food and giant wombs. Theres a confusing bit at the end(well more confusing than usual anyway) in which the creature tries to explain why it is doing this but it makes no sense whatsoever. Something about how humanity is about to follow in its races footsteps and destroy themselves by something theyll soon create. It never really said what that was. It could have been anything from toaster ovens to digital watches who knows. Its baby minder stabs himself rather than let the alien shrimp crawl out of his body and the oily guy(and the other guy) burn the parrot-alien to death with a Molotov cocktail. Ahhthe smell of roasting chicken..err.. alien. End of story in which the rest of the characters wander off and leave their dead comrade laying on the ground to rot. Oh Hell why not save yourself the expense of a funeral? Im sure that was what Corman was thinking when he was trying to cut corners and make his scenes as cheaply as possible.',neg
'No words can describe how awful this film is. Its like the director literally took a s*** in a roll of film and sent it out to the viewing public.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is horrendous The plot is so dumb and the deaths of each character is laughably bad. Some stupid scenes include Akshay Kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes a hologram) Akshay Kumar carrying a bazooka around the town Rajat Bedi getting beaten up by a poorly animated skeleton Rajat Bedi and Siddharth double penetrating Monisha Korella (How did they think this was straight?). Also id like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. The scene that supports this statement is when Kapal has the motorbike and somehow gains the glasses. The shopping job looks like it was done in microsoft paint.<br /><br />The best parts in this movie are with Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that he makes even god feel scared. In one scene he literally breaks open a jail door by kicking it. Chuck Norris round-house has nothing on that! He is even so powerful that he can fly from London to India in a matter of 10 minutes! Overall this movie is perhaps the most poorly made movie in the universe. If you were to watch it watch it for the hilarity that ensues throughout (BTW this movie is supposed to be serious)',neg
'This very loose retelling of Carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering sexually-frank dance between Senaglese prisoner Karmen and her female prison warden but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite into any coherent film. One minute Karmen is all sexual predator the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas... Although the film deserves kudos for postulating the first carnivorously bisexual Karmen the broad strokes it paints are so vignette-like and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes off as a schizophrenic undisciplined melange of Basic-Instinct meets Bound meets an African version of a Bollywood musical.',neg
'Macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid settings. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s Macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one mans quest for power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) tries his hand at updating Macbeth by setting it in the contemporary Melbourne underworld. A film where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala Baz Luhrmans Romeo and Juliet) and royal vassals for gangsters Macbeth is a gritty violent but critically flawed film.<br /><br />Macbeth (Sam Worthington)works for King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After being elevated to the Thane of Glamis by The King (as was prophesied to Macbeth by three witches) Macbeth starts setting his eyes on the throne. One night the King comes to stay at Macbeths house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) talks him into killing The King to assume power. Macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown. But success has its downside as Macbeth soon finds out when he has to go to hideous lengths to protect his murderous secret. <br /><br />OK first things first. The films major fault is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of Macbeth is in a word... boring. I honestly didnt care about Macbeth while watching the film. I had more sympathy for Victoria Hills Lady Macbeth because she bothered to act at least. Worthington sits sullen and wood faced throughout the entire film. I felt like he was doing his best impression of Johnny Deeps George Jung character from Blow... but without the charisma. I have never seen Worthington in a film before so Im not sure if it was his or the Directors fault but either way the glue that should have tied everything together into one cohesive unit is weak.<br /><br />The dialog is good but when matched up to the Geoffrey Wrights Australian Gangster Motif seems a bit out of place. Frentically paced action sequences mixed with long Shaksperian musings creates pacing conflict within the film. I understand that this is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialog intact. But hard fast action scenes following a three minute soliloquy tends to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. <br /><br />The camera-work is highly stylized and for the most part it works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera would slowly jostle back and forth almost constantly. I dont mind shots like that its just overdone. Its passes beyond the realm of being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating. Other than that the art direction and cinematography is fairly well-done. <br /><br />For all of the good qualities Macbeth possesses; stylish direction Shakespearian dialog a strong soundtrack supernatural nude witches(the weird sisters) and good helpings of brutal bloody violence. All of these strengths are forgotten when one considers Sam Worthingtons uninspired portrayal of Macbeth. The role of Macbeth was essential for tying everything together and in this respect Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed miserably making Macbeth a forgettable foray into Shakespeare.',neg

'Anyone who has ever doubted Ingrid Bergmans ability to play comedy need only look to The Bells of St. Marys. OK so shes a nun with TB whos probably in love with Fr. OMalley (think what Luis Bunuel could have done with that) but she also displayed a wonderfully sly sense of fun that made you wish directors had cast her in comedies more often. In Cactus Flower shes a starched dentists nurse (Walter Matthau is the dentist) in love with her boss but keeping it buttoned up. When shes forced to act as his wife in order to hoodwink his mistress (dont ask) she lets loose and the buttons pop. And shes a joy to behold.<br /><br />The movie itself is a hardier than usual translation to the screen of a Broadway hit (you can see its three acts). Its a French Farce (it was originally; its taken from the play Fleur de Cactas by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy) and it hits all the right spots. Matthau uses his great hang-jowl expression to wonderful effect and a klutzy blonde newcomer as she was then called Goldie Hawn almost steals the film as the dizzy mistress who decides to give up her meal ticket because she feels sorry for the wife even though the wife is having a ball. Hawn made such an impression in the role that what she did steal was the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.',pos
'Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? Id say inside the uncanny Virgin of Nuremberg torture device because theres a good risk youll get brutally spiked to death. And yet the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin. The Vampires Coffin is a rather disappointing sequel as director Fernando Méndez doesnt re-create the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957-original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs. No more ominous castles with eerie cobwebs and dark vaults but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughs instead of frights. The story opens inside Count de Lavuds final resting place where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin in order to examine the corpse at a private clinic. Naturally the wooden stake gets removed from his heart and the vampire count comes to live again immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work. The vampire has his eye on a beautiful female patient at the clinic and its up to Dr. Enrique Saldívar to rescue her soul and to destroy the bloodsucker. The Vampires Coffin uses a limited amount of locations and theres very little action. The whole film would actually be pretty boring if it werent for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances. The photography is amazing though with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. This is most notably during the scene in which Count de Lavud stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night. Its the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film the rest is fairly mediocre and déjà-vu.',neg
'Anyone who doesnt laugh all through this movie has been embalmed. I have watched it at least twenty times and I still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise. Fields at 45 still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children. Im biased Im in love with her.<br /><br />The cast of Soapdish is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is flawless as are Robert Downey Jr. an ingénue Elizabeth Shue Whoopi Goldberg Teri Hatcher in one of her early roles Carrie Fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer and best of all Cathy Moriarty as Nurse Nan who leads the plot to get Fields character removed from the show is hilarious.<br /><br />This movie should have won Oscars for best comedy best leading lady in a comedy best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests including writing directing and supporting actors and actresses.

'THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. It features passable acting poor lighting a weak story and some of the worst monster effects Ive ever seen. The plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. This would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. The monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like youre watching a home video or a public-service announcement. I think anyone who sees this will agree that movies should be shot on film.',neg
'I wish Depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success. At least hed have wound up with something.<br /><br />The film struck me as pointless rambling and very stylish like some other recent French films. Not to knock it. Most recent American films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever. We should be grateful I suppose for photography that evokes a European city in the midst of a wind-blown Continental winter and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand whats up.<br /><br />But there can be too much of a good thing. Golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such. (There are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood. Youll love it if youre Vlad the Impaler.) Lots of people die. Catherine Deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle. I dont know why. Golubevas young girl dies too and I dont know why she dies either. She gets slapped in the face falls to the pavement and dies.<br /><br />There is supposedly an explicit sex scene too. Ill have to take their word for it because although it is stylishly photographed it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness. Dont worry about the kiddies being shocked. Theyll probably be asleep by this time anyway.<br /><br />Depardieu isnt a bad actor. As we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man -- well handsome except that his nose cant seem to get out of his way -- to a limping murderous hairy physical wreck we feel sorry for the guy. Golubeva has a wan pretty face with enormous half-lidded eyes and wide cheeks like a doll. Her next movie should be a remake of Lewtons I Walked With a Zombie. Then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band. I guess its a band. As far as I could make out the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. Every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but uncultivated listeners fond of easy listening might not enjoy it. If you dont like the music theres a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with Depardieus walking stick.<br /><br />I must say I found it barely worth sitting through. (And its a longie too.) At times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by sometimes stopping entirely. I wish it had had a few jokes.',neg
'Its very hard to say just what was going on with The Lady from Shanghai and what the film could have been without studio interference. Orson Welles prime interest in film at this point was to raise money for his theater; indeed funding his own projects is what drove him to seek out acting jobs. He made Lady from Shanghai for his soon to be ex-wife Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohn was fearful for Ritas image and held back the release of this movie for one year.<br /><br />The plot concerns an Irish sailor Michael OHara who falls in love with Else (Hayworth stunning with short blond hair). Her husband is a well known criminal attorney Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) who is as crippled on the inside as he is out. He hires OHara to work on his yacht and there OHara is drawn deeper and deeper into a web of murder and deceit.<br /><br />The Lady from Shanghai moves at a snails pace though I agree with one of the posters that films today are criticized for taking time to build a plot. Still this movie drags. The scene in the fun house is fantastic - Welles wanted it without music though and I believe the studio cut it down. Its a shame. The photography throughout is stunning atmospheric bold and very stylish.<br /><br />Welles was an excellent actor handsome in his youth charismatic and possessing a magnificent voice and technique but in many films its almost as if he doesnt trust himself or doesnt take the time to develop a character. Instead he relies on externals such as accents and fake noses. One of the only times he didnt do this was Tomorrow is Forever where the director gets an excellent deeply felt performance out of him. Contrast that with Compulsion where he shows he is a master of pure technical acting as he phones in his performance. Here Welles is doing quadruple duty - as director star co-writer and narrator. Sporting a completely unnecessary accent and looking intense was a fast way to a characterization. Nevertheless he is always compelling.<br /><br />The supporting players are excellent including Sloan and Glenn Anders. Hayworth gorgeous and soft-voiced (her singing was again dubbed by Anita Ellis) is as usual a complete goddess and one of the great screen presences. What a sad life for such a vibrant beauty.<br /><br />Any film that Orson Welles directed is worth seeing and The Lady from Shanghai is no exception. But this one leaves the viewer frustrated as does The Magnificent Ambersons - as does any work that Welles did within the studio system. He was a great artist who should have been given a freer reign; he wasnt. He was a strange dichotomy - he needed more freedom but as is evidenced by some of his later work he needed the structure of the studio. Alas he couldnt have both.',pos
'Somehow they summed up the 60s ten years that radically changed our country in four hours. And what a painful four hours it was. They trivilized the major events and happenings and they claimed it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family. If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash. What was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways but managed to attend every major 60s event through the country. And the second family was such a non-factor. They devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family. That poor son... Please NBC do not make any movies about any other eras....leave that to PBS and the History Channel',neg
'Hollow Man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum. They test the serum on an already invisible Gorilla & it works perfectly Caine & his team of assistants celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers Caine wants to be the first invisible human. He manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & Caine becomes invisible however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible. The team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works Caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory. But then again hes invisible right he can do anything he wants...<br /><br />Directed by Paul Verhoeven I rather liked Hollow Man. You know its just after Christmas I saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable TV & worst of all I feel sick not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop Ive had over the past week so Ill keep this one brief. The script by Andrew W. Marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original The Invisible Man (1933) film which Hollow Man obviously owes a fair bit. It manages to have a petty successful blend of horror sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes. I thought the characters were OK I thought some of the ideas in the film were good although I think its generally known that Verhoeven doesnt deal in subtlety the first thing he has the invisible Caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has Caine rape a woman with the justification whos going to know that Caine says to himself. Then of course theres the gore he shows a rat being torn apart & thats just the opening scene after the credits to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it. Having said that I love horror/gore/exploitation films so Hollow Man delivers for me its just that it might not be everyones cup of tea.<br /><br />Director Verhoeven does a great job or should that be the special effects boys make him look good. The special effects in Hollow Man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless their brilliant & its as simple & straight forward as that. Theres some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top. I love the effect where Kevin Bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the Gorilla. Theres a few gory moments including a rat being eaten someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results.<br /><br />With a staggering budget of about $95000000 Hollow Man is technically faultless I can imagine the interviews on the DVD where some special effects boffin says they mapped Bacons entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldnt they? The acting was OK Bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy.<br /><br />Hollow Man is one of hose big budget Hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or characters but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film well I know I do. Good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual Hollywood product definitely worth a watch.',pos
'I mean really. This is not going to help the Australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind. Okay if youre a stoner and have nothing better to do then maybe.

'From the beginning Til There Was You was on the right track setting up for the big finish where it would all come together. But the thing is it didn t.

'Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that werent exactly true to character this was Classic H:LOTS. The characters outside of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) were true to form and the reunion scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen.<br /><br />Homicide: The Movie aka Life Everlasting is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give it. True to Homicide form there were no happy endings such is life. Thats what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie-cutter cop shows left on television. Kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike.<br /><br />** I call myself a Homicidal Maniac if for no other reason than to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood. **',pos
'SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /><br />I really am in the minority on this one but I liked this movie. Its not a classic but its definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride. I definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating.<br /><br />Perhaps the reason I liked it is because I havent seen the original.Something tells me that with a movie like this its strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus have little to compare it to. This was not a masterpiece but I did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original.<br /><br />There were a few things I liked about it. One was the casting of Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. Since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders he really needed to be excellent and he was. This was a great role for him.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that its made for television. I had no idea this was the case when watching it. It sure seemed like a major motion picture and I would never have guessed this was not a big screen release.<br /><br />I also found the story to be very absorbing. Im not one for action movies but I got sucked into this. Plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama mysticism a love story quirky people every which way you turned. (I didnt even recognize Priestly.) And it was touching. This was not a great movie but it is watchable.<br /><br />And then theres the ending. It packs a strong punch and if ones been involved in the story up to that point its very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end. I am not sure how I feel about the ending. The implication was that Kowalkski survived and though Im highly skeptical of HOW that would be possible it is a movie and realism isnt an ingredient thats always in the mix when making a movie.<br /><br />So Id have to say I found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way which I dont usually like but for some reason is almost forgivable in this movie. Admittedly a lot of things were just props for the plot(could the villains have been anymore stereotypical?) But the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well. However having said that I will admit I can understand why someone whos a major fan of the original would hate this version because though I have not seen the original I have seen many original movies I loved being remade with terrible results. (My big dislike is actually sequels.) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality.<br /><br />People have compared this to Smoky and the Bandit. How about a road version of Legends Of The Fall meets Thelma and Louese as well? I sure felt touches of both films(both of which Im a fan of.) I do not think however that this was a great film. It was better then average to me but far from great. But it was an absorbing adrenalin fueled touching movie with excellent casting of the main character. My vote is 7 of 10.',pos
'We were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here. Well we got it home and could not believe what we saw. Its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor. The main character is all over the place... one moment he is like an immature little kid the next moment he is mature and intelligent then heroic then a perverted stalker.<br /><br />The worst part is all of the out of place sexual content. I have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy but this is just presented in a way that is creepy. Nipple slips close ups of a girls crotch (many times) in white panties or a swimsuit. It was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters. <br /><br />We were expecting something of a mature nature but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was... besides jiggling cartoon boobs and poor dialogue. If you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and crotchs... this is for you. If you are looking for something beyond that this movie was empty. The characters and dialogue were just plain irritating.<br /><br />',neg
'Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or does every movie that starts in Roswell New Mexico suck. Take Alien mixed with The Thing mixed with Contact mixed with of all things On the Beach The Andromeda Strain the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to boot. <br /><br />Derivative doesnt even begin to describe this movie. Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease. (James Spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable Leslie Stefanson asks to join him. he turns her down. AGGH!) <br /><br />In fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it. I mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for broke.<br /><br />With about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. <br /><br />I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif. (Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logans Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them.<br /><br />That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. The acting is mostly fine as Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear. John Lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it.<br /><br />Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper Children of The Corn in Space movie.',neg
'The storyline of The Stranger mirrors somewhat the 1969 film Journey to the Far Side of the Sun (made by Gerry & Sylvia Anderson of Thunderbirds and Space: 1999 fame). A parallel-universe Earth is the premise of both films. But there is a difference. Where the world in The Stranger features a totalitarian regime out to squash the freedom of the citizenry Journey to the Far Side of the Sun merely showed a true mirror world where handwriting roads houses machinery of every kind and of course internal organs were all in reverse (or mirrored) order. So the similarity of parallel Earths is the only connection of both films.<br /><br />Similarly the TV series Land of the Giants came before both of those films having run from 1968 to 1970. It featured a world that was nearly parallel to the Earth with the exception that the planet was populated by giants 12 times the size of the humans who crash-landed there. The idea of a totalitarian government out to capture and contain the little people was similar to the premise of The Stranger more-so than the premise of JTTFSOTS. Perhaps because of the similarly to LOTG a series to The Stranger was shelved. Had it turned into a TV series it would have been a sci-fi version of The Fugitive with star Glenn Corbett being chased by the baddies from week to week hiding out in different locations etc. BTW a stronger script could have helped this film along.',neg
'From the start you know this is a Sam Sherman film more than an Al Adamson film because as the credits roll A Sam Sherman Production appears in letters as big as the title credit. Not only that Mr. Sherman co-wrote the screenplay and it was his idea to use Bob Livingstone a washed-up 69 year old Western star of the old Hollywood era to be his male lead in a picture that Sherman thought would capitalize on the recent success of Swinging Stewardesses. <br /><br />Now why would you want to have a wrinkled old man as your male lead in what is supposed to be a soft-core exploitation feature? It defies explanation but that is Sam Sherman for you. His obsession with old Hollywood colored a lot of his films for Independent International Pictures and he and Al Adamson frequently tried to get has-been actors for their films (e.g. J. Carrol Naish Russ Tamblyn Lon Chaney Jr.etc.). But Bob Livingstone? Tell me the drive-in demographic knew who this 40s second-rater was; its ridiculous! <br /><br />But then again Naughty Stewardesses was a successful picture for them so we cant just write this off as a Sherman fiasco. Still by any aesthetic standard its an incoherent mess. Al Adamson wanted out of this picture and it is easy to see why. First off it has no genre focus at all and drifts around from super soft core (tits and ass/simulated sex only) to a kidnapping thriller (shades of Stecklers Rat Pfink and Boo Boo!) In between we get subjected to painfully boring sequences of the stewardesses traipsing around Vegas to the hackneyed music of Sparrow or Richard Smedley and Connie Hoffmann on a photo shoot in San Francisco. Worst of all we get Bob Livingstone as a Jack LaLanne wannabe in a blue jumpsuit trying to be sexy...gag! (Thankfully his big sex scene with Connie Hoffmann was deleted but you can catch him slurping on her titties on the DVD in the Special Features section. Creepy.) <br /><br />This is a terrible terrible movie but Ill give it three stars for Gary Gravers photography and out of sympathy to Connie Hoffmann for having to make it with Wrinkles Livingstone. Naughty Stewardesses is for Al Adamson completists and/or scholars of exploitation film as Sam Shermans commentary offers vital inside info. All others BEWARE.',neg
'OK hows this for original- this mean rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children all of them ungrateful losers and two creepy servants provided they spend the week in his spooky old house. What happens that night will surprise only those who havent seen a movie or television show before. After a string of murders in which the victims look like theyre bleeding restaurant ketchup we have a painfully obvious twist ending. The cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks. There are also a few second-tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now. As a result the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of Matlock. I will give credit where its due- the closing scene is clever and amusing if youre still awake.',neg

I worry when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves rather than the public. Its interesting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it.

'VAMPYRES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />A motorist (Murray Brown) is lured to an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and becomes enmeshed in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle but his hosts turn out to be vampires with a frenzied lust for human blood...<br /><br />Taking its cue from the lesbian vampire cycle initiated by maverick director Jean Rollin in France and consolidated by the success of Hammers Carmilla series in the UK Jose Ramon Larraz daring shocker VAMPYRES pushed the concept of Adult Horror much further than British censors were prepared to tolerate in 1974 and his film was cut by almost three minutes on its original British release. It isnt difficult to see why! Using its Gothic theme as the pretext for as much nudity sex and bloodshed as the films short running time will allow Larraz (who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym D. Daubeney) uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life death and the impulses - sexual and otherwise - which affirm the human condition.<br /><br />Shot on location at a picturesque country house during the Autumn of 1973 Harry Waxmans haunting cinematography conjures an atmosphere of grim foreboding in which the desolate countryside - bleak and beautiful in equal measure - seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror (Larraz pulled a similar trick earlier the same year with SYMPTOMS a low-key thriller which erupts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel). However despite its pretensions VAMPYRES wafer-thin plot and rough-hewn production values will divide audiences from the outset and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as could be wished the male lead (Brown past his prime at the time of filming) is woefully miscast in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twentysomething stud. A must-see item for cult movie fans an amusing curio for everyone else VAMPYRES is an acquired taste. Watch out for silent era superstar Bessie Love in a brief cameo at the end of the movie.',neg
'Finally watched this shocking movie last night and what a disturbing mindf**ker it is and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes and a total assault on the senses. Looks like a movie from the minds of Lynch (specifically ERASERHEAD) Buttgereit and even a little of Begotten. What this guy does to his pregnant sister is beyond belief but then again did it really happen or is it his brains left and right sides doing battle. Thats the main theme of this piece of art to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasizes overtakes the reasoning and logical left side. And the music in this movie is unbelievable a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. Even though this movie is totally shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard core sex) you will ever see in any movie I viewed it as a work of art and loved it. And that music still amazes me I have to try and find the soundtrack if is available. Watching Subconscious Cruelty is a real event and not something the viewer will easily forget. And a note to gorehounds this is a must-have.<br /><br />Warning... Be careful buying this movie because some prints have fogging on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore especially the copies from the Japanese release.',pos

'Babettes Feast and The Horses Mouth are the two most insightful accurate films on what it is to be a real artist. The key lines in Babettes Feast are not as some other commentators here have said an artist is never poor but two lines that come before and after it:<br /><br />I was able to make them happy when I gave of my very best. ... Throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist: give me the chance to do my very best. <br /><br />I spent nine years producing experimental multi-media music theater in San Francisco raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers actors designers etc. and the artists I supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best. They were just like Babette: they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work. Babettes art is fine French cooking and for her to perform her art at its very best costs 10000 francs. When after years in political exile from France isolated with two caring spinsters on a bleak Scandinavian coast she suddenly gets a windfall of 10000 francs she does what every real artist would do: she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best and so she does it. She spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist. The twist in the movie is that we dont know she is such an artist until she is actually cooking and serving the meal. Up until then she appears to be just a working-class French lady who haggles a bit with the tradesmen and is very serious (her husband and son were murdered in Paris violence in 1871). <br /><br />To such an artist it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it. That is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving. Babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two spinsters or to the religious community. It was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious sect. Indeed she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them. After the meal she is sitting alone sipping some wine not paying the slightest attention to how the guests reacted. She is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist. <br /><br />That is why it is so satisfying and so important to the story that the General unexpectedly shows up -- for as Babette knows instantly a general will know what she has placed before him and will appreciate it. For there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it. She is glad very glad he came in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner the only one she singles out for special treatment -- not either of the spinsters. But she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it. <br /><br />To anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real first-class Parisian dinner as I have (my father was Naval Attache to Paris in the 1980s and I had my honeymoon in France) this dinner and Babettes satisfaction in making it and the pleasure it brings to the diners is absolutely convincing. If any art has the power to suffuse the recipient with a sense of joy it is a fine French meal cooked and served in France. This movie makes a claim about the transformative effects of great art on the recipients. Before the dinner the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome dredging up old resentments. The old hymns fail to restore good fellowship; people ignore them talk over them. But the shared experience of sensual great art -- for the people can enjoy the tastes of the foods and wines even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art -- contents the people puts them in a forgiving mood reconciles them and by making them happy encourages them to love each other and thus has a god-like sacred effect of bringing peace. This is the claim found in the modern art movement today -- that art can supplant the traditional religions in making mankind more peaceful. Thus contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian belief it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that Christian ritual cannot. After all my years in the art world I have to say that this claim -- that art brings peace that religion cannot -- is overblown and invalid. But it is a pretty conceit and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film.<br /><br />One last note: at Babettes arrival at the spinsters home a particular French general Galliffet is named as the person who in 1871 executed Babettes husband and son and imposed a military rule that she had to flee. At the end of the film as the General tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in Paris many years before (before 1871) at the conclusion of some military maneuvers it turns out that this same Galliffet was his host at the meal. As the General tells the story French general Galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman the only woman he would risk his life for. Of course that woman was Babette. Thus ironically the same French general who said he honored Babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever.',pos
'Like Freddys Revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesnt go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it. Basically Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. This has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy. <br /><br /> Ive not alot to say about this. Its moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over. Uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series.',neg
'While I can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography (I thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low-fi home movie feel) I must say that I thought the script and acting of WHAT ALICE FOUND were excellent! Dean Bell has crafted a real gem that Judith Ivey charms with character-driven delight. Her performance of Sandra is a pleasure -- unfolding alternately as diabolical and romantic. We are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions... and never given more information than is necessary. Hers and the supporting casts efforts meet Bells post-modern fairy tale with arms wide open. Emily Graces Alice is infused with a doey-eyed magic. She seems to mold like clay before us morphing into some sort of beautiful lost beast. By the end we are at odds with words as she is saying goodbye to her mother. Kudos also should be doled out to Jane Lincoln Taylor -- whose Mother provides the right amount of tragic historic weight -- and Justin Parkinson -- whose shy first-time John Sam provides one of the sweetest if not most awkward sex scenes in film. Bell has created a first rate story and assembled a plethora of talent to make it.',pos

'I am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of gushy nonsense such as that this film [proves] that when it is predestined love will find a way. I begin in this way not to criticize a specific reviewer but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film even before it hit the theaters. Even the best of films do not prove anything nor are they intended to. The best films entertain and move the viewer and The English Patient fails on both criteria.<br /><br />I remember the studios promotion of The English Patient very clearly: From the producers of Amadeus and One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest it grandly announced. An ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word producers in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of The English Patient so very inappropriately with the truly great director Milos Forman. Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman.<br /><br />While the novel by Michael Ondaatje upon which the film was based is a good one it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever. Aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar the film bears little resemblance to the novel.<br /><br />Despite misgivings which began when I heard that shamelessly misleading promotion I went to see this film in the theater. As it began to unfold I realized that the rendering of the novels peculiar magic had failed that the actors knew their words but not their characters and that their characters were flat dull and unengaging. The film was a complete travesty of Ondaatjes novel and a completely still-born cinematic artifact of the worst description.<br /><br />Those who gush over this film are very apt to speak with adjectives like sweeping and grand and hypnotic. Well it is none of those. In fact not even Ondaatjes fine novel could be described as sweeping or grand. It could be described as magical and hypnotic -- yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver. It is almost as if Minghella had as a reader entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale skeletal version a version that not only missed the spirit of the story but that focused on the wrong characters. He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for storys metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them as well.<br /><br />Minghella took the central focus away from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and Katherine Clifton thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the essence of it.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put in unengaging uninspiring uninvolving unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great driving passionate love-affair to the viewer but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable perfunctory liaison between two flat shallow uninteresting adulterers. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by Minghellas grandiose and overblown presentation.<br /><br />The grand sweeping David-Lean-like qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there. The comparison to David Lean (Dr. Zhivago) is positively insulting to yet another great director. Take for example the Patients sandstorm scene which is no doubt one wherein these grand sweeping qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not grand -- it is not even convincing. The subsequent burying of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally completely lacked either drama or emotion --in fact because it was so patently weak it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of place.<br /><br />This film failed. It failed as a rendering of the novel and it failed as a film. It seems to have been the anointed Oscar vehicle of the year (joining such over-trumpeted filmic slosh as Kramer vs. Kramer or Terms of Endearment). One can only thank God that even the hype-driven Acadamy<br /><br />had the good sense to present the Best Actress award to Frances McDormand for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film Fargo. There was not a single performance in the execrable English Patient that was not either embarrassingly horrid over-acting (Willem Dafoe) or truly forgettable mediocre acting (Fiennes and Scott Thomas).<br /><br />Why this non-entity of a film retains a coven of fanatical (and clearly tasteless) devotees will remain a mystery. Fortunately the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently and it will not thankfully have the strength ever to dig itself out.',neg
'When I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening I was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it. I was sorry when I talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended. I on the other hand felt completely the opposite. I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else. People I talked to said there was too much talking! Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters. I found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American movie-going public seems to have a tendency to want easy-to-follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused. They also like to be spoon-fed tidy endings--happy OR sad. This disgusts me. Nobody wants to be challenged anymore??? And as for the ending (and I dont want to be a spoiler) I am totally content because I know in my heart that these two characters WILL see each other again. Its all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny. Its a very personal film that doesnt speak to all people. But it certainly spoke to me. Give it a chance! Be patient with it! Richard Linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna. Watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters. As if you yourself were tripping through Europe on a Eurail pass. Its very intimate. Plus Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life. They must have improvised during some parts and it works well. They have a great chemistry in their roles. Their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses. I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr. Linklater and I deeply respect him for getting this film made. It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much. Bravo for romance!!!',pos
'Not having seen the 1936 version of this story I cannot offer any comparison there. I can however state that Stephen Sondheims musical treatment of this story is absolutely genius. Only Sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right yet perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject matter. If anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is they should see this (and Dr. Strangelove as well). When Mrs. Lovett goes from having the worst pies in London to a booming business with high acclaim we arent talking Soylent Green - but the ingredients are similar. Particularly brilliant is the song where Mrs. Lovett pitches her idea to Mr. Todd. Even in the introductory number the line ...they went to their Maker impeccably shaved... gives a great indication of the premise the drama AND the comedy to come. Outstanding!',pos
'Im sorry but Star Wars Episode 1 did not do any justice to Natalie Portmans talent (and undeniable cuteness). She was entirely underused as Queen Amidala and when she was used her makeup was frighteningly terrible. For Anywhere But Here she sheds her god-awful makeup and she acts normally. And not only can she act good she looks good doing it. Im a bit older than she (shes only 18) and I have little or no chance of meeting her but hey a guy is allowed to dream right?<br /><br />Even though Susan Sarandon does take a good turn in this movie the film belongs entirely to Portman. Ive been a watcher of Portmans since Beautiful Girls (where she was younger but just as cute). Theres big things for her in the future - I can see it.',pos
'Talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite moms flighty behavior. Apart from several good sequences I didnt quite buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (shes too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady) and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman fares much better as her kid and yet theres a creepy aloofness to her work (and some of her scenes such as the one where she asks a boy to strip are misguided and uncomfortable to watch). Certainly not an incompetent piece Anywhere But Here does have moments that work but it isnt an embraceable film nor has it proved to be an important one. ** from ****',neg
'I cannot believe it has been 25 yrs since I first watched this story on TV. I remembered to have been very much touched by it and was lucky to get the VHS tape several years ago. I did not watch it again until just recently. I have been watched it over and over ever since. I must have watched it 10 times in the past 2 wks.<br /><br />The acting is superb the story is compelling and I am embarrassed to say that I did not appreciate actor Bryan Browns talent until now. The playful facial expressions shown in the first half - when he gave Jean the stolen medicine in Malaya is such a contrast to his very reserved and nervous body languages shown in the second half: in their first drink together in Caines and the touring of the homestead. We have to wait until the wedding reception especially the final dance scene to see his open display of affection for Jean. The same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in Malaya. Who wouldnt want to be his Mrs. Boong ? <br /><br />While Joe changed from a cocky almost bigger than life figure in the Malaya jungle to a somewhat self-conscious average Joe in his own backyard Jean took the opposite road; her wartime experience seems to have given her new confidence. She wasted no time and went after what she wanted. She took steps to take what she could get - exactly as Joe had told her to once upon a time.<br /><br />For me all these transformations helps to show this is more than just a love story - this is a story about growth courage and fragility in life. The solicitor -Noel is both a sweet and sad figure. He too gave much to Jean - he gave his last hope for love. At the end he did what true love requires -- he put her happiness ahead of his own.<br /><br />I happened to like the fight between Joe & Jean that was not in the book. I thought its an appropriate and necessary addition for it helped to surface the inner struggles they both had to deal with in order to make their life together possible.<br /><br />Now I am older maybe I understand life love and loss a little better. This story touches me even deeper. <br /><br />I am however surprised to see B. Brown has blue eyes in the promo photo shown on this site. He most definitely did not in A Town like Alice. Well 25 yrs is a long time !',pos
'Kramer Vs. Kramer is a near-heartening drama about shocking drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple. Meryl Streep in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity plays an unhappy stay-at-home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman to find another role for herself. Hoffman is dumbstruck having absolutely no idea what to do with himself having taken so much for granted that he doesnt know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning.<br /><br />Hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks. He is restless relentless and impatient but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to. Hes been focused on his career in advertising and when he is left to raise his son Billy all by himself chaos ushers in immediately. Hes the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity. After awhile as he befriends his neighbor and Joannas former friend played by sexy Jane Alexander Hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. In the meantime his boundless energy redirects towards raising Billy and he loses his job.<br /><br />The custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance. Even if the ending is a little unmotivated subjectified for the audience the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s.',pos
'High school. Years and decades later some look back on it with fondness others with embarrassment. But few find it easy to forget. Its one of the most critical phases of our lives when changes come fast and furious whether were ready or not. No longer children not yet adults irresistible forces buffet us pushing and pulling us in every direction.<br /><br />Fame did its best to capture this turbulent chaotic period for its cast of young characters. For the most part it succeeded. It meandered but did feel like a slice of life. This movie holds a special place in the hearts of the Class of 80. We had just bid farewell to a decade and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years. We were headed out into the cold cruel world leaving home for college then parts unknown. As we approached our watershed event this newly released movie was like a two-hour yearbook for us. We couldnt escape the titular song on the radio. That was us up there on the screen. Those were our friends rivals and classmates as we had faced our own dreams frustrations successes and failures.<br /><br />Its especially poignant for those who attended any of New York Citys other elite top-tier high schools especially Stuyvesant Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like the kids here we were considered the best of the best. We had no auditions but instead rigorous entrance exams. Perhaps even more than the Performing Arts kids we were expected to change the world although not necessarily become famous. Like them not all of us made it. But the pressure cooker environment fostered extraordinary camaraderie and esprit de corps not unlike the toe-tapping Hot Lunch Jam in the cafeteria. On our own graduation day our spirits soared almost like the jubilant crescendo in the rousing finale. The film leaves us fittingly on a single triumphant note at the end of I Sing the Body Electric pointing to the blindingly bright boundless future and all the promise it held.<br /><br />Fame couldnt have been set anywhere else. This story never would have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television but NYC is a mecca for all of the arts. Home not only to what was then called PA but also world-renowned Juilliard NYC is a cultural center unmatched by any other city in the world. Its also a time capsule of the rest of the city of the time showing the seediness grit and dirt that was endemic of a New York still struggling back from the fiscal crisis that had nearly bankrupted it. But most of all it showed the vitality since muted by the inroads of Giuliani Disney and tourism.<br /><br />What I wouldnt give to be young again. But with Fame at least I can remember what it was like.',pos
'When it first came out this work by the Meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation. Luckily it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television and the bad evolution of most direct cinema.<br /><br />Really at first we must say that this isnt really direct cinema it is more cinema verité. The difference between the two is very slight but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary we are made to feel the presence of the Meysels brothers and they do interact with the characters filmed. This as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation. The Meysels have been allowed in the house and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household. And both Edith and Edie just love the idea of being filmed.<br /><br />It would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of God narration and shallow interviews. Here we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house a madness that does seem to go down well with both Edie and her mother Edith. Their house is a mess litter and animals everywhere faded colors and furniture all over the house and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality. These two people have lived with each other their whole life and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention but rather because they cant help talking to each other this way. They know each other too well to hide their inner feelings there is no need. In the end though even as they blame each other for their lives they really love each other deeply. Edie says she doesnt want her mother to die because she loves her very much and Edith says that she doesnt want Edie to leave her because she doesnt want to be alone.<br /><br />But the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age the two women cant help be girls. They cannot help being one the singer the other the dancer. Exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera. When Edie asks David Meysels rhetorically Where have you been all my life? she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills. A beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again the way only the Meysels and few others could do.',pos

'Chalk this one up in the win column this was a superb movie. The acting performances were great and the script was equally great.<br /><br />Helen Hunt was magnificent as the Riverside police officer Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. She was a rookie cop with the Riverside Police Dept. She ended up in an affair with a coworker that she knew had a wife and kids all the while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to catch a serial killer. <br /><br />Jeff Fahey (the Ray Liotta look alike) did a bang up job as the confused often stammering police officer that had an affair with Gina. He was stoic as an officer but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extra-marital affair.<br /><br />Steven Weber most notably from the sitcom Wings did a nice job as the quiet meek underachieving sociopath. On the surface he was an innocent loser but beneath the surface lied a cold hearted killer. Weber really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys.<br /><br />The entire movie was spectacular. Each scene each verbal exchange let us know more and more about the characters. The production team did a phenomenal job with condensing days if not weeks worth of events into a 90 minute movie. This movie was a good example of doing a lot with little.',pos
'I neglected this film when I used to go to the movie store but then the curiosity got to me and I decided to check it out. I loved it!!!

Then of course they start to party and when theyre really in the mood they decide to have a séance which awakens a demon. The demon possesses Angela and she starts her gruesome slaughtering.

'This is truly one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger who stars as the ornery grandfather Charlie is in full overacting mode hoping that the more flashy he is the better his performance (Cue buzzer sound). Rod Steiger is one of the last true film legends and to see him in this film (although End of Days is the 2nd worst film Ive ever seen) is really heartbreaking. From the bad storyline to the nonexistent direction it becomes abudantly clear that the only reason this film was made was that the producers last name ended in DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this film is that it is so bad its truly hysterical. Look for the flashback scene where Rod wheres a Jor-El wig from Superman and a big black porno mustache. One only hopes that his follow up film I Believe in America from Uber-producer Kevin Arbouet will redeem him and leave a good taste in everyones mouths.',neg
'Wha-BAM! Someone surely had fun devouring a whole truckload of acid-mushrooms and then subsequently scripting this crazy excuse for a motion picture! Writer Howard Cohen expands the Sword & Sorcery concept with a couple of extra Ss like Sex Silliness (more) Sex and Sheer Stupidity! This isnt just a movie this is every juvenile perverts dreams & fantasies come true! Deathstalker has it all: blood violence trolls female mud-wrestling attempted rape successful rape life-sized pigs (!) awful hairstyles hideously oiled muscular bodies multi-sexual orgies gay warriors tournaments-to-the-death delirious witches dismemberment laughable villains and boobs boobs BOOOOOOOOOBIES!! Deathstalker literally wipes the floor with its obvious role-model Conan: The Barbarian when it comes to terms of cheesiness and sheer flamboyance. The story is evidently of minor importance. Lone and gay (only he doesnt know it yet) warrior Deathstalker goes on a mission as commanded by an annoying witch to gather the three notorious elements of creation or something like that. On his journey he combines forces with a troll-turned-human a fighter whos even gayer than he is and - last but not least - a luscious lady who doesnt really seem to be a big support of the concept of bras. Together they head for the kingdom of the ultimately evil Munkar where theyll participate in a warriors tournament and conquer no less than two out of three elements. Munkar is bald guy with half a spiders web tattooed on his skull and an impressive harem that would even make the wealthiest oil sheik jealous. Okay granted Deathstalker is a pretty damn awful and at some times even unendurable movie. The fight sequences are lame and the costumes and make-up effects are downright pitiable. For a moment when beholding the opening sequence I actually feared I was watching Troll; the Prequel. The monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing but its undeniable entertainment if youre in an undemanding mood. I presume this isnt a favorite amongst feminists as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat umdiscriminating. Most of the gals exclusively serve as eye-candy in the harem. Theyre allowed crawl over the floor naked and play around in the mud but strictly forbidden to open their mouths. The two leading ladies (Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson) are ravishing but - in all honesty - if it wouldnt be for their continuously exposed racks they would hardly be worth mentioning either.',neg

What ever you do dont miss the DVD extras. This a great blind date file too. Will Smith does well in this - even though in is light acting - he pulls trough it all well. The movie is a little slow in pacing - dont expect too much action - the laughs are there - and so is the message - but the timing is a little slow. Use the low moments to whisper or kiss - it will pick up. The ending makes the feel good moments worth it. Most of all expect fun light hearted fare - and watch for some great upstaging by the supporting actors - they make the film. The plot twists are predictable - but it IS a date move so get the refills of popcorn from the kitchen - and dont make her pause it. Count on more dates after this movie - shell want o see what is next in line. Remember Hitchs advice!!! <br /><br />Enjoy.',pos
'Incredibly Vampire Assassin is significantly worse than such atrocities as Tequila Body Shots and Zombie Nation - and those movies are TERRIBLE. Writer/director/star Ron Hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts. Possibly the worst camera-work editing lighting sound visual effects music and fight choreography I have ever seen in a movie. Rarely do two shots cut together nor can you see much in the beyond-dim lighting. The terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast stretching the movie to a near-deadly 87 minutes. This is a truly laughable embarrassment for everyone involved. Obviously aficionados of terrible film-making will want to see this but its very hard to sit through no matter how experienced a bad-movie viewer you are. The fact that Ron Hall thought this was actually releasable is astounding. If you are a movie director and you actually think its OK for the opening credits of your movie to include a few frames of the words SLUG before the title appears left over from your rough edit - and you apparently cant muster the energy to edit those frames out - then your standards are obviously so low as to be insulting. I am astounded that Lions Gate/Maple agreed to release this movie on DVD. In spite of Rudy Ray Moores very brief cameo this movie is a work of supreme self-indulgence on Ron Halls part - he clearly thinks he is a formidable actor and must also believe he possesses superior writing and directing skills - but the movie is so unbelievably inept that its hard to believe hed actually want people to see it for fear of being brutally excoriated like Im doing right now. A jaw-dropping insanely terrible movie. Im not kidding.',neg
'Ive seen the Gator Bait films and this is almost exactly the same thing as those. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them. The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones (although not very far) is that the sexual content is not glorified. There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film but not for a second is it ever sexy. Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive but thats only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audiences need to see this woman seek revenge.<br /><br />This is a weak film it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers. I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral but I was glad to see that since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead it was not meant to pass off as a T&A film.<br /><br />B-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a B-movie and contains more than its share of nudity the nudity does not drive the plot. On the other hand the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary drop-outs just like they were in the Gator Bait films and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless B-movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind but instead it simply satisfies the audiences desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /><br />The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks. Oddly the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (although not by much) but it is by far the most painful to watch. We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible (it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord) but again this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with.<br /><br />(spoilers) You know that this is all the movie means to do since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed. The woman does not live happily ever after she doesnt write her book she doesnt leave and never return to that nightmare place she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks. But hey what more did you expect?<br /><br />Oh and did you read the tagline? If you decide to waste your time watching this try and find any man getting broken or burned. I was really looking forward to those',neg
'Vulpine Massacre should have been this movies actual title. And the tag-line should have read Guaranteed to make your kids CRY! This is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. Starting with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them. The only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the den giving insight into the animals loves and lives... Lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals. Sounds good huh? Well from there things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core...<br /><br />*** Spoilers Below - Or they it may be a Warning!***<br /><br />Almost first off we learn one of the foxes is born blind. But seems to get along well enough and theres a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him... And then he dies... Next we have one of the siblings adventures. And then he dies... One of the sisters gets her screen-time... and then she dies...And so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature in traps just up and vanish and even by a bunch of snowmobiles! By the end of the movie almost all the foxes have been massacred. Though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen. (Least not in the version we saw.) Unlike say Tarka the Otter the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then snuffed out. One or two losses would have been acceptable. It is a nature film after all. But not nearly the whole family.<br /><br />Do not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box into thinking its safe for the kids.

'I gave this loooooooooooong film a 2 because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise if you cant read like a speed-reader you will NEVER get through the subtitles that try to keep up with the Spanish speed talking! And what the hell is going on in the plot if you cant read the subtitles. Endless stares and goof-eyes and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour or so. Some good cinematography but also some so DARK you think your screen has burned out. How this won anything I will never understand. Difficult to talk about ACTING since the lead actors seem to just stare and look lovingly at each other when they are not pushing each other away. The character Geraldo is so attractive that it is difficult to believe that ANYONE would push him away. And what is with his mother? I just plain didnt GET IT most of the time except that there were three guys that all seem to have had a history with each other....but never figured out who was whose EX.',neg
'This movie could be likened to comfort food for the soul. Anyone who has ever tried and tried to save a relationship could relate to this movie. So many parts of it are so hilarious and so many parts are so heartbreakingly true. Its not perfect in its production or even its dialog but the story is unique which is saying a lot for modern romantic comedies. Luke Wilson is bland at best but Heather Graham does an exceptional job in my opinion. Give it a try - despite the trite looking DVD cover.The character of Joline brings a lot of issues up in our culture of self-service. She asks us if commitment is really for the other person or ourselves. Truly it is ourselves. Following through on promises (anywhere from marriage to an errand for a friend) is a great feeling. Anymore our word is nothing but a shapeshifting puff of smoke. Joline is like a wake-up call. We must be conscious of our words and commitments they mean more than we think. At the same time we must not commit to someone who is incapable of doing the same.',pos

'This is a beautifully-made film finely balancing the fragile human stories (both before and after 1945) and the indiscriminating combat of war. The use of outtakes from Battle of Britain (a film that does not nearly so well portray the 1940s!) enhances rather than detracts from the whole. A deeply impressive work this lived in my memory for the 2 years since I saw it and I have just bought it to explore the making-of extras.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film (movie). Like Aces High it alternates between viscerally exciting (or scary) air combat sequences where the viewer might experience actual loss of characters theyd come to care about but also unpredictable interactions on the ground where skillful writers and real-life experiences inform some involving and moving events. This also underlines the fact that for many people 1945 marked not just the end of one conflict but the beginning of another and even today we still dont recognise the loss bravery and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes or even worse we venerate them from a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that entails - making their sacrifices all the more valiant.<br /><br />Watching this movie is an experience which will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy and back to love that endures even beyond death.

'whereas the hard-boiled detective stories of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler have fitted to cinema like a fox in a chicken coop - indeed creating the definitively modern American genre and style in the process - those of what might be called Golden Age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever. The problem with books like those of Agatha Christie Dorothy L. Sayers or S.S. Van Dine (on whose work this film is based) is that they are low on action or variety - whereas Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe traverse the mean streets of LA working class tenements bars offices wealthy mansions and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence Golden Age fiction is generally fixed in location the scene of the murder usually a lavish country house and the action is limited to investigating clues and interviewing suspects. This is a very static procedure plot reduced to puzzle.<br /><br />This of course is as much ideological as anything else the Golden Age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement; the hard-boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre (both of authority and of a city) dividing itself up into hostile ever uncontrollable and lawless camps. Another major problem with Golden age fiction is character - because we cannot know the answer to the crime until the end we cannot gain access to characters motivations or emotions being defined solely by their potential need to murder. The detective unlike the anxious prejudice-ridden private eyes are simply there to be brilliant and maybe a little eccentric.<br /><br />The problem with most films from Golden Age books is that they try to be period recreations of the Merchant Ivory/Jane Austen school and end up looking silly. There have been successes for example the radical reworkings of Ellery Queen and others by Claude Chabrol. In the English-speaking world there have really only been two. The Alistair Sim classic Green For Danger works because it pushes the form almost into parody while never betraying the integrity or interest of the mystery.<br /><br />Before that came Michael Curtizs brilliant The Kennel Murder Case. The narrative is pure Golden Age. A repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him. He is duly murdered in a seemingly foolproof manner indicating suicide slumped in a locked room. The caricatured policemen fall hopelessly for the bait. It is up to Philo Vance gentleman and amateur detective neither old nor fat to read the clues more insightfully open the case out of the confines of the room and eventually solve the case the corpse being little more than the pretext for intellectual stimulation.<br /><br />What is interesting is not this detective plot - which can only ever be unsatisfying as all solutions are - although it is rarely less than entertaining and full of comical bits of business. There isnt even really an attempt to subvert the image of the perfect detective - there is one alarming scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect with no protest from Vance but thats about it.<br /><br />What marks Kennel as a classic is its modernity. Curtiz is not generally considered a great auteur because he has no consistent themes or evidence of artistic development. But he was Hollywoods greatest craftsman and he is on sensational form here. if the Golden Age detective story is mere puzzle Curtiz takes this idea to is logical extreme creating an abstract variation on his source reducing narrative character and location to geometry a series of lines from the beautiful art-deco sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition  and as they glide furiously at an angle jolt the dead decor to life.<br /><br />This treatment is appropriate to a story that resolutely refuses realism it is a pattern that turns the detective plot into a hall of mirrors like the two central brothers or the original crime itself borrowed from an Unsolved Mysteries book. This fantasy world of nasty rich men who collect Oriental relics (shades of The Moonstone?) inscrutable Chinese servants ex-cons turned butlers dog-loving fops Runyonesque cops is the perfect habitat for Vance a man who will drop a cruise to Europe on a fanciful hunch who knows the social world of these people and yet is tainted by his interest in crime and association with the police or would be if he wasnt anything more than a thinking machine William Powell the greatest American comedian of the decade bravely subsuming his idiosyncratic humanity.<br /><br />But if the treatment is rarefied the climax is spectacularly brutal involving vicious dogs and attempted murder. The police and the detective supposed to be preventing crime are guilty of inciting one.',pos
'I cant understand what it is that fans of the genre didnt like about this film. It was truly a lot of fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters but not this time. I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldnt enjoy the film. I believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen but again this was not the case. To me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both films that I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. The Mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck. People liked it for its special effects. Films like the Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development they are more like funhouse rides. Well with that analogy the Mummy was a B ticket to the Hauntings E-ticket.',pos
'Forbidden Planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema especially from the 1950s. There was The Day the Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from Shakespeares The Tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough. Its the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at (though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates) but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we dont know were channeling it.<br /><br />On the surface- that is in the first ten minutes- it looks standard if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the B-movies of the period. A ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet Altair-4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before. But the only one left is Dr. Morbis (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead. Morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts led by the Skipper (Leslie Nielsen) can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on Earth.<br /><br />But theres a catch - something is killing off members of the crew of the ship one by one every night even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence which the invisible something goes through easily. Meanwhile theres some romance possibly between the Skipper and Alraira and theres a more pushy vibe from the doctor: you shouldnt have come to the planet to start and now you need to go. What happens from this is even more fascinating just on a purely intellectual level but Forbidden Planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas. While everyone may remember Robbie the Robot and for good reason perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of Fantasia.<br /><br />The acting from Pidgeon is subtle: you wouldnt expect him to be a villain though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect. And the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent from Nielsen as a born leader to Holliman providing some great comic relief as the Cook (who I should add helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon Robbie provides). And the effects for its time are extraordinary (sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too) and the music done by electronics is beautiful in its tones. But ultimately its the screenplay and careful direction from Hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the B-movie lot. When its meant to be funny its intentionally so and it works. When its dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors. And when we are made to think about a horrible situation it comes on gradually with nuance not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action.<br /><br />An inspiration for many other sci-fi films and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time-old its a classy and entertaining classic.',pos
'Any film that deals with bigotry in a positive manner is a film that should still be seen by current audiences as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of bigotry.<br /><br />Aside from that the film is really an old-fashioned love story..boy meets girl..boys loses girl...boy gets girl back....<br /><br />The weakest role goes to the late Kent Smith as Lt. General Webster(Riccardo Montalban is a close second)...my question would be how did he ever get to be a 3-star general...the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinates its a wonder they show him any respect at all.<br /><br />Brandos southern accent is a little overdone and some scenes have a few holes but overall I enjoy the film every time I see it.<br /><br />Red Buttons is great...I always love seeing comedians in dramatic roles...as in Buttons case often a comedian can better portray the tragedy of a person than a more traditional dramatic actor.',pos

'Life hits us in the face........we must try to stay beautiful<br /><br />Debut movie from one of Belgians best artists (he sings songs) Tom Barman. A long awaited movie and---happy happy joy joy for Flemish filmmaking---really worth watching and a promising piece of work! It takes us into the lifes of 8 main characters that live through a Friday- and night. The title says a lot about the way we spend time with them: we float as they do into Friday nights party where they kinda meet.<br /><br />Its rhytmic style is very thought off. Superb use of music. It sometimes takes the upperhand to the images and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20minutes???) is a thrilling visual experience cause of the way that its shot. It keeps you really with it while its set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party.....so hard to shoot.<br /><br />Thank you menijèr Barman for making this daring movie in these already some years going poor times of Flemish filmmaking. You made my day!',pos
'OK I dont kid myself that this is the typical gay love life but since when are straight romances in real life as they are on the screen? This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander). And having seen him in Priscilla Queen of the Desert only the day before he is probably one of the most secure-in-their-masculinity actors around. :) Anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot. Thumbs up! 8/10',pos
'This movie is pretty predictable nuff said....from the delayed kissing scene to the inevitable coming around of grandpa...this is a great movie for the 10-12 age group but beyond that it has no market..i give it 4/10 only because it achieved exactly what it set out to do and nothing more.',neg
'I just watched this movie last night and I HAD to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film. In a word - dont. I seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a Quentin Tarantino/Eddie Murphy phase i.e. every other word was a curse word. I dont have a problem with profuse cursing as in Good Will Hunting provided it helps to delve more into the characters. In this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional *gasp* or laughter from the audience. The three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype the wall street jerk the coffee house jerk and the Im-Not-Gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-Feminine-Side slightly-less-of-a-jerk. You just dont give a damn about any of them! They are all shallow unredemable losers who you WANT to see lose. For those who dare this film does have a couple funny moments the very beginning and the very end. The toilet/vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda Uh yeah way. Really though I would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies.',neg
'This film was an interesting take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was not as bad as I expected that it wasnt the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a good job with her part. It wasnt the greatest performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice. The locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects.<br /><br />I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.<br /><br />The film had some parallels to the John Ford style but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well. If this had been an western family the locusts would have won at the end punishing the farmer for his pride lust and gluttony. However here he learns his lesson then wins.',pos
'Any Gun Can Play (1967) directed by Enzo G. Castellari is a very good pastiche of Spaghetti Westerns especially Leones. The first half is great which apart from the opening which is a direct nod to For a Few Dollars More with Monco Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El Indio lookalikes walking into a ghost-town and then promptly killed by a Bounty Hunter called The Stranger is entirely serious with great gunfights (especially the train-robbing scene) fast and furious action and nice performances from Gilbert Roland George Hilton and (who manages well considering that he is badly miscast) Edd Byrnes. But then when the film reaches the half-way mark there is a jokey fist-fight between Hilton and Byrnes. It isnt very funny and is the weakest part of the film but it throws everything you have seen previously in a new light. You realise that in fact the whole thing is a spoof of Spaghetti Western conventions and in retrospect the first half is so well done that you completely miss this spoof undercurrent. What now follows is a more obvious parody with even some acrobatic jumping around from Brynes that predates all those seventies Circus Westerns. The ending a complete send-up of The Good the Bad and the Ugly climax is very well done as in other hands it could have been very silly. So a pretty fun Spaghetti Western that doesnt take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spaghetti Westerns.',pos
'STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Alice having defeated Freddy at the end of the last film is now trying to re-adjust her life. But her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence- Freddy trying to come out into their world again.<br /><br />Its interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing Freddy films- Charles Russell (Eraser The Mask) Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight Cutthroat Island Cliffhanger Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space Predator 2.) But while Russell and Harlin made a good job of it Hopkins IMO has made something of a podge with this entry that should be quickly forgotten.<br /><br />The story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here with Freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby. Even at about an hour and a half it all gets rather tiresome and of course not scary at all.<br /><br />The bon appetit bitch catch-phrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry. *',neg

'The concept of this movie is pretty compelling: zombie children climbing out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their deaths in the backwoods of Pennsylvania. Cool. The problem I had with the movie is the lack of creativity when dealing with the zombies. The makers could have really spiced this film up with some terror-like imagery a la The Ring such as stop action reverse camera walking or stuff like that. When the zombie children are strolling through the woods they look like a bunch of 9 year-olds walking to a playground in West Philadelphia. Instead of pick axes and shovels they could have easily been carrying baseball bats and gloves. Why would I fear these little kids? Anyone could just run away in a straight line to safety. Also who in their right mind would have stayed one night with their children in that creepy run-down house? The moment I opened that front door and looked around I would have said Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Son go start the car. Im going around back to pee on a bush and then were out of here. Totally unbelievable movie. Dont waste your time.',neg
'Lets get things straight. I was raised Catholic and in a very religious family and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home. That was useful for two things: to make a convinced Atheist out of me and to give me deep insightful knowledge about the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest witnesses a murder and clearly sees the face of the killer he CAN report it to the police even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards. He can not reveal what hes told in confession but he CAN talk about anything he sees outside that and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. So here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie. And another lie is theres no absolution for murder. According to the Catholic Church theres absolution for any sin as long as theres sincere repentance. So far the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller.<br /><br />As people frequently say this movie would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates had switched roles. Hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters (I will never lament enough that he lost Al Capone in favor of one of De Niros weakest performances in The Untouchables) and Bates features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past. But above that I think the film would have been much better had real-life Ulster native Liam Neeson (back then mostly unknown to big audiences) played Mickey Rourkes part. Not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters but hed make us believe the character as real something Rourke just cant. Back in the 80s Rourke was not a bad actor (afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks) but he was one of those performers like Brad Dourif whos as good as the director he works with. And as a former IRA terrorist Rourkes acting comes across more like a pimp. Sad to think that had this movie been made just some three to six years later (when Neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with Sam Raimis enjoyable Darkman and superstardom in 1993 with Schindlers List while Rourke became pretty much of a forgotten has-been) Liam and Mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit (Rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of Docherty but just cant carry this movie along as the lead). Yet another missed opportunity and yet another film with the potential of being a classic that became instantly forgettable fare.<br /><br />Ironically enough the often criticized score (by underrated composer Bill Conti) worked for me. I didnt find it overly-melodramatic but suitably gritty and beautiful. It reminded me of Howard Shores score for The Silence of the Lambs. Heres to Mike Hodges talent who made Get Carter yes but dont forget hes the mastermind behind Flash Gordon as well...<br /><br />It seems the film was massacred in the cutting room (it shows as some parts are really choppy and confusing and others just dont glue) and a Directors Cut is waiting to see the light. OK but I seriously doubt that will make it a great movie as well still have the bad casting and the false premise there. 4/10.',neg
'Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didnt have a solid ten overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe its just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to. And lets not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someones imagination it was lovely. They barely knew each other but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. Ill never let go Jack. Titanic is a great film down to its very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.',pos
'When setting out this film director Mary Harron seemingly had the goal of clearly documenting the progress of Bettie Pages career from early modelling days to leaving modelling to go back home after the Senate Hearings on Juvenile Delinquency and her religious rediscovery in the 50s and so intent is she to get all of these facts on screen in the time allowed she seems to have missed out on taking any time to explain anything in depth.<br /><br />When you think of someone who had Pages career youd think that there would be plenty to discuss her reasons decisions life event personal traumas but Harron avoids any kind of personal exploration of the character. In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film there are brief hints of child abuse domestic violence and a gang rape but these are all rushed past and then never referred to again. You get the impression that Harron and Guinevere Turner (co-writer) wanted to gloss over anything that wasnt glamorous and flattering. You go into this film expecting to gain an insight into who the person behind the posters was but all you are given is a list of things that she did and recreations of some of her most famous photo shoots.<br /><br />All in all the film really frustrates you as you watch desperately waiting for some extra layer to reveal itself. How did she balance her religion with her job? What made this young Tennessee girl move from modelling into bondage photography. The film simply shows her going to another modelling agency and putting on whatever shes told but surely it would have involved some shock and deliberation this was after all the 50s.<br /><br />It seems to me that Harron is trying to make a point about how tame all this is by todays standards (Page never took any photos of explicit sexual actions) and how the reaction some gave this kind of thing was really overzealous And although this is true she never actually makes it seem sordid in the eyes of others. Today we look at a young girl posing topless and think nothing off it but we should have got some sort of feeling about how shocking it would have been to a contemporary audience. This woman was a central part of a Senate hearing on Juvenile Delinquency but no one is ever really shown as shocked.<br /><br />Basically I left this film just thinking how tame it was. Harron and Turner have managed to avoid anything that might be unpleasant to a viewer. They come across as two lifelong fans of Miss Page and are desperate to make sure that nothing absolutely nothing could possibly put a bad light on their heroine and have therefore avoided any in depth probing into who she really was. (Before and after her career there are reports of her violent nature and mental problems) And all thats left is the string of events that made up her career without any substance whatsoever behind it.',neg

'The only thing that makes this one watchable is Coreys performance as the lunatic killer on the loose. What remains is a most impossible tale of revenge and matrimonial discord. During the walkie-talkie scenes I had the feeling that Cotten was squeezing a sweet potato and not a communication device.

'MY LEFT FOOT in my opinion is a great biopic about one of the worlds most talented authors and painters. The performances were smashing the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect. I thought that Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man although I couldnt understand what he was saying most of the time. In addition when he threw a tantrum I got a little scared. Also its just so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion if you are a die-hard fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or like biopics I highly recommend this great biopic about one of the worlds most talented authors and painters.

The film is rich with interesting dialogue Perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.<br /><br />The crowning glory of this film though lies with Christoph Waltz whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite theatrical (couldnt think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!! Hoping to see him in something again soon!',pos

This one not so much.<br /><br />The acting for the most part in the Abandoned was decent but the movie dragged on an on and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion.

'A lot of people are flaming this film for the presence of Paris Hilton but this is not a fair reason to object to the movie. The reality is that Paris has a fairly minimal part she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen. The film also makes fun of her on several occasions usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision. For those who enjoy Paris Hiltons stage presence this may be a movie to see at home when its released on video because at the screening I was at we all laughed at her misfortunes through the movie and she is portrayed as a woman of questionable values.<br /><br />The movie itself was pretty good (unlike the recent flood of weak horror flicks) it has everything a good horror should; a creepy villain excessive violence acts which make that average person cringe...this movie hit all the bases. It is definitely worth a watch.',pos
'Simon Wests remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring old school thrills to a contemporary audience. Starring talented teen Camilla Belle When a Stanger Calls fails to even elicit a shocked or even surprised face. Poor attempts at scaring the audience range from blurred coats that look like people to building the tense music up for a cat running out of the shadows. The plot follows Jill Johnson (Belle) a teenage girl that has to pay off a bill to her father via babysitting. She is invited to work for the night at a house by the river and thinks it a perfectly easy way to make cash. But little does she know a stranger lurks in the house and constantly harasses Johnson via the phone. A pathetic excuse for a film.',neg
'The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house good effects work and sound work a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past I found interesting. There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmiths score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. What I wish couldve happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago and it still holds up. The Haunting couldve used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me a little anticlimactic. Overall I enjoyed it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish it scared me more.',pos

I can watch this film anytime.I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score.

'So this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see. Its up there with Crossbones and Southern Comfort but if your a bad movie fan like I am this atrocity of a film will be the most fun youve had in years. WHY does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms? WHY does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag? And who is he anyway? WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares! Just laugh at it. This movie has no continuity no plot no anything really. Ron Halls range of emotions are always off. He looks happy when he should be sad angry when he should be confused. The rest of the cast couldnt act their way out of a paper bag. The special (Short bus kinda special) effects are randomly placed and never needed. Most scenes are lit with a desk lamp if they are lit at all. Mel Novak has the AUDACITY to look off-camera for his line and its not even edited out. They just keep on filming. In fact half of this movie isnt even on film at all. Its 1/2 film 1/2 sony hand-cam. For most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home. This movie doesnt just have a few plot holes its a mine field of confusion and mental pain! But OH do I love it! Thank you Ron Hall for this cinematic abomination. I went out and bought it cause its just so damn funny. ($1.99 on Amazon and I had it rush delivered!)<br /><br />I have weapons! I have weapons! I have WEAPONS!',neg
'I havent yet read the Kurt Vonnegut book this was adapted from but I am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen. Overall I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonneguts novels. It concerns the story of an American living in Germany who is recruited as a spy for the US. His job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked Nazis and send secret messages to the Americans via his weekly radio show. But when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to New York where various odd plot twists await.<br /><br />If Mother Night has a problem its that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times. But for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb. And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing Christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked Nazi in a prison cell. Very much recommended.',pos
'I have not read the novel or anything other by Kurt Vonnegut but I am now intending to start. This grips you from the very first frame and does not let go until the end credits start rolling. Taking you places you dont expect the plot is interesting throughout. The pacing is spot-on nothing lasts too long and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what weve seen. It is well-told and well-thought out. Ive never watched a film that I feel I could particularly compare this to. It is intense and exciting as well as funny and sad. The acting is excellent Nolte absolutely shines Goodman again proves that he doesnt have to go for laughs and Lee and Arkin are spellbinding. I could go on really... no role is treated to a less than stellar performance. The editing and cinematography are marvelous and all of the visuals are great with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones. I am going to go for other movies directed by Keith Gordon as well as the other two apparently related to this through the author of the books. There is one scene of sexuality and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this. I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; it is not pleasant. 8/10',pos
'The person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer/director/star--or is in fact the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle. How about this? You want to make a movie--tell a story; entertain; draw me in with vivid characters. Sure you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. However do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads. If Im to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy.',neg
'This is a pretty good made for TV flick of the what if variety. As in what if terrorists exploded a dirty bomb in a big city in this case London. Lots of poking at folks that say were all set in the event of an emergency that then reveal that theyre not exactly telling the full story. And is anyone prepared for something like this? You can bet not. This shows the material for the bombs being smuggled into the country the making of the bombs the secrecy and double lives that the people behind it lead etc. It also shows public servants (i.e. firemen) giving their all to save people when they arent getting any help when the government doesnt want to send anyone else into the affected area. Also shows how woefully inadequate preparations are for any such occurrence as the government talks everything up but then stands there with their mouths hanging open as the tragedy unfolds. And could this happen right here in the good old USA? Well unless youve been living in caves for the past 20 years something already has to an extent and dont bet that anyone would be prepared for something of this nature. This is fairly realistic and yes even scary. Well worth seeing but just hope nothing like this ever really happens. 8 out of 10.',pos
'Its 2005 my friends...a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology. So why cant we see a movie thats a little more thought out than this cheesy low-budget film. Ive seen a lot of low-budget movies that rock my socks off but this one...its almost as if its trying to be horrible. Just...dont...watch it. I can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good. I feel like a small child produced this entire movie. Theres not even an original plot line. Vampire Assassins in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself. Can someone tell me if perhaps this was designed as a comedy movie and I just didnt know it? It makes me wonder what does the sequel have in store for us who so loved the first installment?',neg
'So this is what actress Kim Basinger has succumbed to? Mmm to tell the truth the films title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic but simplicity can have its strengths. Anyhow by the end of While She Was Out I was left feeling rather indifferent. Not the worse (despite being engulfed by negatives) but theres easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm but compact and unbalanced late-night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park.<br /><br />The problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material (taken from a short story) along with the very variable performances. The flimsy script was poorly thought-out (which isnt so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off) so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events. As for the bunch of stereotypical goons (led by an unconvincing Lukas Hass as a loose canon) terrorizing Basinger well they were less than threatening but hopelessly clueless. Watching Basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand (dont ask me why?) knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didnt elicit tension or emotion but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up. Basingers performance is stout-like but doesnt craft much empathy. Craig Sheffer shows up as her hot-headed husband. Strangely I couldnt keep my eyes off the screen thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic (why would she be constantly carrying it) and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug her choices were quite disappointing. Watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead.<br /><br />Susan Montfords soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy as it pretty much chugs along. I liked the opening credits though with its hauntingly sullen score (which is the most effective thing throughout the feature) and polished photography.<br /><br />No great shakes. Doesnt ask much of your time but I wouldnt care to see it again. However with the inclusion of a Joy Division song it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen.',neg
'Having seen and loved Greg Lombardos most recent film Knots (he co-wrote and directed that feature as well) I decided to check out his earlier work and this movie was well worth the effort and rental. Macbeth in Manhattan is a tongue in cheek excellent take on the Shakespeare favorite updated and moved to NYC. I was impressed by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script and was wowed by the way the storyline of the production in the movie mirrors the storyline of the play itself - and very cleverly at that. The trials and tribulations of life in Manhattan parallel many a Shakespeare play and Central Park was rarely put to better use than as the woods around Macbeths castle. Mr. Lombardo obviously has a fond place in his heart for New York and New York stories (Knots is a funny and warm sex comedy about six thirty-something New Yorkers set primarily in a charming Brooklyn neighborhood with Manhattan offices and a downtown loft thrown in for good measure) and has spent considerable time around the plays of Shakespeare. The movie is well-paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of Macbeth. It reminded me of Al Pacinos Looking for Richard - another wonderful Shakespeare play within a movie. I highly recommend checking out Macbeth in Manhattan.',pos
'Over the many years there are some films that just slip by & hardly anyone views. <br /><br />Choose Conner is one of those films.<br /><br />This small gem played at some festivals & had a short 2 week run in a small theatre in West Hollywood making all of about $ 5500.<br /><br />It is now on DVD I do hope many more will now see this.<br /><br />It is a strange drama of a shrewd youngish politician who influences a very bright 15 year old lad.This politico also has a handsome nephew (about 17 years old) who befriends the 15 year old lad.<br /><br />The above paragraph is slightly vague as to what occurs SO is the film & that is what I appreciated we do NOT get all the factsMuch is left to our own thinking. You will hear dialog that makes this logical..<br /><br />Steven Weber (Wings) is our politicianhis role is slightly vaguethis is another point for the audience to ponder<br /><br />Alex D.Linz is our 15 year old He was about 17 when they made this movie but easily can pass for younger. He has been in films & TV since he was a young child He is a very good actor & is quite convincing.<br /><br />Escher Holloway is the older teen This role is his first major part & he too is excellent.<br /><br />Now I am saving the best for last the writer/director<br /><br />Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For a first effort a big thumbs up. I do hope he as well as our 2 lads have a long career.<br /><br />Ratings: *** (out of 4) 86 points(out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)',pos
'THE RIDDLE was written and directed by Brendan Foley in what appears to be an attempt to pull the mysteries of the Charles Dickens novels into a contemporary story but that attempt is thwarted by electing to use the two periods of time format in which the riddle is unraveled. Despite a cast of well-known actors trying their best to pull off this direct to DVD movie the end product is a long tedious amateurish mess that can only be considered as entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast as remembered from other films. <br /><br />Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist confined to reporting on dog racing events while he dreams of important reporting assignments. A series of similar murders happens to include an old friend of Mikes - Sadie (Vera Day) who runs a pub on the banks of the Thames having just discovered an old valuable unpublished manuscript by Charles Dickens and has a heart of gold giving sandwiches away to such pathetic creatures as an old tramp beachcomber (Derek Jacobi). Sadies murder attracts Mike to the role of detective journalism and with the help of policewoman Kate (Julie Cox) he begins to tie the investigation to clues he finds in reading the Dickens manuscript. Disrupting the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks to Dickens time as Dickens (again Derek Jacobi) narrates a rather personal story of peculiar murders. The parallel between stories and the cross casting among actors may have worked in anothers hands but the finessing of this kind of venture escapes writer/director Brendan Foley. He draws his story to a close (at long last) with a tired Hollywoodesque ending. <br /><br />In addition to Jones Jacobi Cox and Day the film somehow attracted the attention of Vanessa Redgrave Jason Flemyng PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contributions are minimal but happily distracting. This is a flimsy bit of treacle leaving the viewer wondering how films of this quality ever find funding. Grady Harp',neg
'This film is a tapestry a series of portraits of Rom communities woven together by music. Its very much a musicians film because of the paucity of spoken dialogue - and what dialogue there is is not important to the structure of the narrative. Some might expect a National Geographic tale of customs dress and music or a plot-line orbiting a few central characters - dont look for that here.<br /><br />This is because it paints a portrait of a family of peoples rather than telling a story of individuals. The plot is the story through space (India to Andalucia) and/or/ time (we cannot tell) of a people. There is no need of narration. You get a sense of a joyous people strongly linked in small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great sense of sadness in parts at their rejection by society at large.<br /><br />So its a paean to Rom culture very beautifully shot with a wide spectrum of Rom music and a sting in the tail which is the oppression these people have faced and still face.',pos
'Whilst it is universally acknowledged that Fearful Symmetry was heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode They Have Been They Are They Will Be whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point. As a huge fan of both series I subscribe to the latter belief although the less charitable may not do. James Whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster but he pulls it off with style the teaser being an absolute gem. Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible character out of Kyle Lang and Jack Rader seethes with menace as Ed Meecham. Forget Fearful Symmetrys dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X File.',pos
'I had no idea this movie was produced by WWE. Wrestling is lame enough. Why did they have to soil their name further by making a movie as crappy as this one was?? I found it to be a complete disappointment. If i had of known this movie was going to be as stupid as it was I would have stayed home and done something more entertaining. Sure Ill give them the credit of the cool effects; but the killer didnt seem as scary as he could have been. He lacked a number of things. But Ill let you point them out for yourselves. The plot was a great idea just could have been done in a much better way. Maybe in the future WWE will stick to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the film industry..',neg
'All internet buzz aside this movie was god awful. I expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything. Instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller/horror movie and they completely missed. There were only a few good parts and a couple good lines by Samuel Jackson. Other than that it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes. All of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie. Now that the movie has actually come out hopefully this joke will die. Dont waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash. If youre looking for something thats funny and entertaining then just go to Snakes on a Blog.',neg
'The only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack their choices and viewpoints and the philosophical questions that it raises. Tru feels that she is helping people who arent supposed to die and Jack feels that they are supposed to die and she is messing with fates plan or the universes plan or such-whatnot.<br /><br />But she is obviously able to change things so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the series metaphysics. Jack has no basis for believing that there is. And very conveniently Tru never asks him the right questions. Nobody does. Which obviously proves that the makers of the series dont have an answer.<br /><br />There simply is no plot!<br /><br />Instead they leave it murky in order for the series to be able to continue with its boring girl stuff only occasionally interrupted by Tru and Jacks racing against each other towards ends that are unknown...<br /><br />It turns out that there is nothing to any of it. A teenage pop series with that pretends to be something else.<br /><br />Your time will be better spent sleeping.',neg
'I just watched the DVD version of BORN BAD and found it to be tense gritty and near the end too graphic for the faint of heart. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman turn in superior performances. For a low budget film this picture delivers. The depth of character and clever dialogue are two things not usually seen in a Roger Corman picture. Check it out on DVD!',pos
'Return to Sender a.k.a. Convicted is almost imperfect. The one good thing about this particular film was that I was never bored. That being said the reviews that hail this movie as a low-budget success may not have watched the same movie that I saw.<br /><br />Rather than write a review and tell you what happens and what works and doesnt work I will simply comment that nothing works. There are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi through. The acting in the film is not very good although that may be a result of a script so poorly worded that it could have been ghost written by George Lucas. There was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate. Did I mention that there were some plot holes? By the end of the movie you are wondering how a blind guy can be such a good shot with a shotgun why Kelly Preston trusts Aidan Quinn why she would fall asleep the night before her client is supposed to be killed how Aidan Quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that keeps breaking down during the rest of the movie why Aidan Quinn didnt by a fifth instead of a bunch of nips etc.<br /><br />With all that being said this is certainly a B-movie and a terrible one at that. The unfortunate thing is that it just isnt bad enough to be good. If you value your time please let this serve as a public service message to stay away from this one.',neg
'Never viewed this film and consider it a great Classic with great veteran actors. In the period that this film was made people in America were different there was no TV or all the modern things we have today except the Radio and the starting out of great films being made in Hollywood. Sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today. Ann ShirleyMurder My Sweet44 played a young orphan gal who was called Carrot Top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks who were like two wise owls and watched over Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened the entire town found out about it within minutes. It is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living. Today it seems very corn ball and stupid but believe me this was the way people were in America during the 1920. & 30s and they were a great generation that loved good family films.',pos
'In what must be one of the most blood-freezing movies ever a transvestite is murdering people in New York and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. One can see how Brian DePalma takes some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and stuff. Michael Caine plays a most thought-provoking character while Angie Dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo. Keith Gordon (who later starred in Christine) is probably the most interesting character in the movie. But you cant really understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing it you may never know just whom you can trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.',pos
